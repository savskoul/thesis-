Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This structured wine has 25-year old vines as its basis. It is concentrated and dense as well as bringing out the ripe berry fruits that are typical of 2012. With the structure and acidity well in place, this wine will age. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a great wine. It has all the elements in place to produce a wine that will last for years: powerful fruit, rich tannins and a structure that is built to last. This is elegant, impressive and concentrated. Almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, the grape gives the wine its fruit and its tannins. Drink from 2028."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a fruity, Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine, with tannins that support and balance the black currant flavor. Wood aging lightly brushes the structure."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Merlot makes up three quarters of this wine with the rest Cabernets Franc (17%) and Sauvignon. The Franc shows itself, with aromas of lightly leafy herbs that are followed by tire rubber, anise, vanilla and cherry. The cranberry and cherry flavors are sweet, with rustic tannins backing them up."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine shows extraction, new wood and firm tannins. What it also has is the fruit weight to sustain all this. Given 4–5 years, the wine's richness and smoky flavors will come together with the black currant fruit."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Smooth and rich, this has fine black and red cherry flavors, along with structured, dry tannins. There is a spice note from the wood aging, which is balanced by the acidity. The finish has a fine, generous texture. Give this wine at least four years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"While this Stephané Derenoncourt wine has dry tannins, it also has ripe fruit and blackberry flavors. Concentrated and firm for now, from 18 months in barrel, it will develop well to give a rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon and 32% Merlot, this offers aromas of high-toned red fruit, French-oak spice and herbs that lead to luxurious but still in-check dark-fruit flavors. Tart black-tea accents persist on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Very intense wine, packed with dark tannins, solid and powerful. It is leavened with great perfumes, while the overall effect is dark, brooding and concentrated."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Dating back to the early Middle Ages, the estate is based around an ancient chateau. The wine, from old vines, is structured and dense with firm tannins and ripe black-plum fruits. It shows fine acidity at the end. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"91-93 Powerfully tannic wine, the dryness balanced with sumptuous fruit. The wine shows balance, although the tannins are a major element."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A rich, bold wine full of wood flavors that are already well integrated with the ripe fruit and solid tannins. The wine is dense, while having a surface polish of smooth fruitiness. Give the wine 3–5 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine shows mint aromas and big black-fruit flavors. With high toast wood aging, it feels extracted, with bitter chocolate paralleling the blackberry fruits. It has considerable power and density and needs aging. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This annual study of Pomerol by the longtime California producer is a bit reserved and nearly austere on the nose, slowly revealing black coffee bean, tar, elderberry and herbs. Crushed herbs and bittersweet chocolate show once sipped, giving slight spice to the dense elderberry and blueberry fruit. It's still a bit wound-up, so drink 2018–2028."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Fruity and spicy, this is a finely wrought wine. Structured and concentrated, it will develop well, giving a solid wine with tannins as well as blackberry fruits. Drink this Sébastian and Nicolas Carreau wine from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Blending Cabernet with 33% Petit Verdot might seem like folly indeed but it works on this wine. The aromas of flowers, vanilla and spice are quite reticent while the dark fruit flavors pack a well-balanced punch, with firm tannins and spritely, mouthwatering acids capturing the attention."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Mint and eucalypt aromas set the scene for a modern, polished wine, packed with wood tannins as well as ripe black fruits. Currently, the tannins are winning giving a wine that is dark, structured and dry. So give it at least five years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This soft, ready-to-drink wine is all about black-currant fruitiness, with only the lightest of tannins. Juicy, fresh acidity finishes an attractive wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"With its high proportion of Merlot, this is a slinky, rich wine, smooth and ripe. Yes, there are tannins, but the jammy fruit softens the dark corners. It should age, but is not for the long-term."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Crisp fruit dominates this second wine from Durfort Vivens. It has tannins, tight acidity as well as the potential for further aging. Spice and wood flavors finish the wine on a firm note. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Aromas of black tar, chocolate and berries lead to a wine that is so effortlessly delicious that it's easy to forget the power the Merlot gives it. The center is round, but dark, filled with sweetness; the outer layers are full of red jelly and toast. There are tannins, but they, too, are sweet."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and it's very good, especially for the price. Smooth and soft, it offers lush blackberry, red currant, cherry, chocolate and herb flavors that are drinking well now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"There is plenty of wood, both in aromas and to taste. What is worrying is the dominance of the wood over the relatively light fruit character. There are just hints of Cabernet black currants, but then the wood closes in. It needs 3–4 years to come together."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"On this blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon and 21% Petit Verdot from Adelaida Springs Ranch, iron-laced, gamy scents lead the nose, which also picks up aromas of elderberry and oak smoke. Plums and other purple fruit show on the palate, along with black licorice and strong but well-integrated tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"In this broad wine, the grapes have been harvested ripe and juicy. It has a fresh acidity typical of the vintage. The red berry and black currant fruit flavors are forward and well balanced, with a crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Winemaker: Abrie Beeslaar. Always a stunner, in both regular release as well as the CWG form, Kanonkop's Paul Sauer Bordeaux-style blend is bold and concentrated, with tremendous potential for long-term aging. Made from 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc, it's brimming with notes of cassis, licorice root and black-fruit preserves, all buoyed by ample acidity and a pronounced mentholated-herb lift. Bittersweet cocoa, char and chicory unfold on the back of the black fruit-skin fueled finish. Robust, full and firm, drink 2020–2026."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A raisiny and ultraripe Bordeaux-style blend, two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon. It has apparently been given a lot of time in heavily-toasted barrels, and the layers of smoke, espresso, cinnamon and tobacco dominate. A wine for those who like the blockbuster, oaky style."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"With some good concentration and hints of the wood aging, this ripe, full wine has both fruit and tannins. A stalky, black currant element adds texture as well as a fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a firmly textured wine, with tannins pushing through the black currant fruit. It is beginning to show a balanced structure and a smooth, smoky character that's leavened by acidity and juicy fruit."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Good and dry, but awkward, with slightly vegetal flavors sticking through riper ones of blackberries and black currants. The acid-tannin relationship also is unbalanced. Redeems itself on the finish, with a flourish of chocolate."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This unusual Bordeaux-style blend has a substantial amount (61%) of Petit Verdot, yet that often-inky and tannic grape does not overwhelm the other four, and gives the wine a powerful foundation. The palate broadens out with generous black fruits, polished tannins, and lively acidity, finishing with a bit of cedar and a whiff of roasted meat."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A hard-edged wine, it's very firm and very dry. It is all structure, showing little in the way of fruit potential."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A solid, fruity wine supported by ripe tannins. The wine has a good sense of its rich self, a fine presence of ripe plum fruit flavors and a warm texture. There is a fine juicy aftertaste."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Bordeaux-style blend is Baer's top wine. A bright bouquet of violet, berry, pepper and stone greets you at first sniff, and it gets better and better from there. Dark fruits weave through a supple and striated flavor palette, long and detailed."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"While there are firm tannins here, the wine also has rich fruit. The two together, allied to the concentration, promise some good aging for a solidly made wine. Fine acidity cuts through in the aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe fruit, new wood flavors and a rounded character give this structured and textured wine a fine sense of shape. It has weight, richness and a well balanced texture. Age it for four years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Strongly perfumed with new wood, this polished wine is rich, structured and packed with fruit. It has a fine, tannic character balanced by red berry fruit and fine acidity. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Yes, that is the correct spelling, as shown on the wine's label. A blend of 10% Merlot, 56% Syrah, and 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is dark, plum-colored and dusty with scents of plum and prune. Soft and moving quickly into midlife, it drinks like an older wine, with soft tannins and a hint of supple leather."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Big wood, big fruit—there are no half measures here. The wine is spicy from the tannins and wood, the fruit is densely black with red berry tinges, and the power is evident throughout. This wine has weight."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine's fruitiness comes from stalky black currant flavors that have a green edge. It shows tannins, bitter chocolate and considerable acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a true Claret, in that the blend includes 41% Merlot, 36% Cabernet Franc, 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 9% Malbec. It is lushly scented with licorice, tobacco, clove, some plastic and dark fruits, especially black cherry. The fruit and indeed the wine itself has been softened to the point of losing its focus; perhaps an effort to subdue the vineyard's notorious tannins. This is forward and pleasant but a bit diffuse."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Everything is here in this great wine. The solid fruit flavors are of black berries and dried raisins, and there is a rich, powerful structure. Above all, it is finely balanced. It shows that a wine can be powerful without being high alcohol."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"91–93. Barrel sample. Rich blackberry fruits are surrounded by a dense structure on this wine. The palate is ripe, but balanced with acidity, juiciness and a solid concentrated character."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A structured, Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine that is already showing its ripe juicy side. It is already impressive, with its layers of butts as well as acidity. The black-currant fruitiness of the vintage is shining through. Currently performing well, this property is at the southern end of the Haut-Médoc region. Drink the wine from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This perfumed wine, with a dry tannic core, is just beginning to soften. The potential for the black fruits is already there. Drink this solid wine from early 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Produced by consultant Pascal Chatonnet, this is basic Saint-Emilion with attitude. Spicy new wood, rich, bitter chocolate flavors and superripe berry fruits are kept in order by the acidity and the dense core of dry tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Impenetrable ruby in hue, this heavy-hitting blend of 51% Petit Verdot, 20% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 13% Cabernet Sauvignon offers tight aromas of cassis, char and espresso, with hints of blackberry and tobacco. The palate demonstrates impressive balance between its flesh, acids and tannins, while boasting notable concentration. A note of black raspberry extends onto the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is the second wine of Château Labégorce. It has much of the elegance of the top wine with firm tannins and generous fruits kept in stylish proportion. Black currant and berry fruits lie under the dark, dry exterior. The wine is dense, needing several years' aging. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Always a bit herbaceous, this year the underlying leanness shows in rather green fruit, veering into bell pepper, dill, mint and oregano. All the oak in France and America can't really make the fruit any riper. But the oak does add smoky, creamy, vanilla notes and sweetness, too. There is some pretty fruit—notably blackberry—in the finish, but still, this is a wine of structure. It's fantastically well made, a classy quaff, and it will pair well with rich red meats, especially beef."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The very tannic '05 reserve is a blend of Petit Verdot, Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc. It's fleshy and rich in blackberry, cassis and tobacco flavors, with lots of new toasty oak, and there's something meaty, like ground hamburger with a splash of tamari. Utterly delicious and very fine, this low-production bottling should evolve over many years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A concentrated wine, it's packed with both dark fruits and tannins. A dense structure contrasts with the fresher black currant fruitiness. Ripe and full-bodied, the wine needs to age. Drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a Merlot-based blend, tightly wound, with tart berry fruit flavors. It gathers and concentrates into a dense, fruit-laden finish, streaked with espresso and dark chocolate. Though labeled simply Yakima Valley, it's all Red Mountain fruit, mostly from Klipsun."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Consultant Stéphane Derenoncourt has helped this light wine to have a good balance and soft, generous fruitiness. The tannins are kind, rounded and already well integrated with the fruit. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Earthy, smoky berry and cherry aromas are distinctly leathery and lightly herbal. This feels tight and bold, with cutting acidity. Flavors of toasty oak, herbal plum and black peppercorn finish long, due to blazing residual acidity. In fact, this is a sharp rendition of Erasmo that's not likely to get any more friendly than it currently is. Drink through 2025."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Elegant as well as rich, this is a beautiful wine. It has great depth of flavor, the sweetest fruit, deliciously ripe. At the same time, the tannins are an underlying sustenance to the impressive ageworthiness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Winemaker: Frans Smit. This Bordeaux-style blend, made from 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc, is warm yet bright, with high notes of red cherry, currant, rhubarb cake and vanilla bean. Aged for 24 months in French oak, it's plush and velvety in structure, with loads of sweet spice and baked cherry on the palate. An enduring cedar note graces the close. Drink now–2021."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Delicate and elegant wine, with smoky fruit, ripe but freshened with a tight layer of acidity. It has delicious black currant juice flavors, but the texture remains light and the tannins soft."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a lively, fruity wine that is ready to drink now. It has juicy fruitiness from black currant and strawberry notes, along with soft tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"From a Merlot-dominated, 24-acre vineyard this is a strongly mineral wine, with young, dark tannins and a powerful structure. A more juicy, fruity side brings out black currants and berries. Together the structure and the fruit promise good aging. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This lean wine, all acidity and tannins, has a severe character that is not likely to go away. The estate has been handed down from mother to daughter for seven generations and now owned by enologist Marie Laure Latorre. It was named for the Merlot plot planted on 08/11/99, the date of the last total solar eclipse seen in France."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A great mix of solid tannins and juicy fruit, this is a rich and structured wine, with the firm character of the year and deep blackberry flavor. It has weight and an edge of spice, finishing with acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc each make up 50% of this blend. The aromas are forward, with notes of matchstick, smoke, herb, char and game. The flavors are lighter in style, with game and herb influences throughout that distract."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90-92. Barrel sample. Rich and ripe, the wine has delicious Cabernet flavors. It offers ripe and rounded fruits with juiciness rather than great density."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Tannins and acidity hint to fine aging potential for this well-made, balanced wine. Acidity and freshness are dominant. Give this wine till 2016 to develop."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Layers of black fruits and tight tannins set this wine on a serious road. It has the freshness of the vintage as well as the bright acidity. At the same time it is structured and dense. This second wine of Château Margaux is ripe and ethereal in its lift. Drink from 2024.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"91-93 Rich, the structure all a part of the ripe blackberry fruits, very dark in style. The wine is very ripe, still retaining elegance"
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"There's good density here. This wine shows plenty of ripe Merlot fruit flavors, jammy, lifted with dried fruits and blackberries. It's a rounded, ripe wine, but shot through with a curious, unbalanced, very dry wood element."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This ripe, smoky wine is structured, full of new oak flavors and dense with both fruit and tannins. Its concentrated, bold blackberry flavors and firm tannins mix with smoky wood notes and acidity. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,It's the smoky flavors and acidity that dominate this fresh wine. It has hints of black-currant flavors that may develop although the wine is light and shows more dry tannins than fruit at this stage. Think about waiting until 2018.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Fermented in large barrels to preserve the fruit, this is a dense wine, full of the ripe red-berry and black-plum flavor that's layered with mint and new wood notes. Juicy, rich and concentrated, this is worth aging for at least five years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of 28% Cabernet Franc, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Malbec, 18% Petit Verdot and 10% Merlot, this is a big, bold and powerful wine, with superb balance and a firm, concentrated structure that promises great long-term aging. Dense aromas and flavors of blackberry, boysenberry, cherry and fig are layered with notes of cocoa powder, roasted espresso bean and cigar tobacco. Ripe, rich and lush, but not overdone, hints of charred oak and black pepper linger on the finish. Drink 2018–2025."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Unusual, high-toned aromas of green herbs, fresh flowers and pomegranate lead to smooth cherry and orange-peel flavors with abundant floral notes throughout. It provides lots of easy-drinking pleasure, though the floral notes at times seem overpowering."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This blend offers beguiling, complex aromas of violets, scorched earth, cassis, black licorice and graphite. The flavors are tightly wound, showing poise and presence. It drinks well out of the gate but cellaring will be particularly rewarded. Best from 2022 through 2030."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Forward red fruits give a good beginning to this light and fruity blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It is crisp with red currant flavors and layers of acidity. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"It's the Carmenère (14%) that pops first on this Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc-dominant blend.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a full, ripe wine. It has red fruits, black currants and a rich seam of tannins. There is also a smoky character that adds attraction. With a ripe aftertaste, the wine is developing well and should be ready from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"In the village of Soussans, and in the north of the Margaux appellation, this estate has a fine reputation for its wines. This vintage, with its great balance between fruit and tannins, shows why. It is a ripe wine full of black fruit and with the bright acidity of the vintage. Drink the wine from 2021."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The blend is 50% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Cabernet Franc, aged in 100% new French oak. The only wine from this producer that is a blend, it currently shows an abundance of barrel flavors. The baking spices overpower some of the signature elements that this distinguished vineyard imparts—the mineral, saline, iron and steel notes often found in Ciel's red wines. The fruit remains gorgeously ripe, and with a bit more bottle age those subtle flavors may reappear."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a field blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc, and 6% Malbec, all co-fermented and estate-grown. It's nicely evolved, ripe and fruity—a flavor cavalcade of pastry fruits and spices, fig, twig, cacao and coffee. Yes you may cellar this wine, but why wait? It's drinking beautifully."

Based on Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with splashes of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, this is delicious and complex, offering a blast of blackberry, blueberry-concentrate and mineral flavors.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,". Recent vintages have left Bordeaux with an alcohol problem, as seen in this wine. The saving grace is the essential Cabernet Sauvignon structure and acidity that keeps the ripe Merlot in balance."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"93-95. Barrel sample. Dense and ripe, this wine boasts sweet tannins and flavors of ripe plums. With the vintage's tight, taut acidity, the aging potential is there."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of 54% Malbec and 46% Petit Verdot, this lithe, medium-bodied wine makes an interesting contrast to Cullen's Mangan Vineyard Merlot-Malbec-Petit Verdot. It's a leaner wine, with modest cherry-berry fruit and ample accents of cinnamon, cedar and vanilla."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"89-91 Barrel sample. Considerable freshness here, a wine that has ripe blackcurrant fruit, but very soft tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Though not labeled as such, this could be a varietal Cabernet Franc (80%). Dried herb, tobacco and wood spice aromas lead to well balanced, expressive dried black cherry flavors that stretch out on the finish. The aromas and flavors don't quite sync up but it still brings a lot of appeal."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Fresh and fruity, this is a bright wine, full of almost shocking acidity and red-currant fruits. Its tannins are there, although more of an afterthought to the fruit. Drink this light fresh wine from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Closed-up at present, this aromatic brooder has notes of red and black fruit, scorched earth and herbs, along with a floral top note. It has a mountain-fruit profile of firm, chewy tannins, tart acids and dense flavors. Time in the cellar is required to fully appreciate it. Let it be until at least 2020 but it should have a good 15 years beyond that."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The new French oak (60%) and rich fruit aromas and flavors play perfectly off each other. Notes of dark roasted coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate meld with fresh herbs and dark cherries. It's rich and layered with abundant fruit and barrel flavors capped off by a tart, lingering finish. Best after 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Paloumey is in the southern Médoc, close to Margaux. This brings out a perfumed character that sits well with the fresh black currant fruit and gentle tannins. There is a great juicy quality that develops as the wine opens."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot with the balance Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this wine offers aromas of coffee, cherry and herbs. It's full bodied with sweet cranberry flavors backed by gritty tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Cabernet Sauvignon comprises 59% of this wine, with 35% Malbec and 6% Petit Verdot blended in for good measure. Together, they offer firm lengthy tannins and a generous presence of body and weight. The darker characteristics of chocolate and blackberry are balanced by crisp red currant and spicy clove."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Dark, viscous and monumental, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend detonates on the palate with black currants, chocolate and cedar concentration, wrapped into the most perfect tannins. Outstanding, and should age for many years. Only 277 cases of this wine, which was grown on steep hillsides, were produced."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The wine is structured while also juicy. Its red-berry fruits are in the process of coming together with the tannins to give a rich wine. It has plenty of acidity at the end to give a crisp aftertaste.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A new wood aged selection of vines from Château Haut Beyzac, a property being restored by Pennsylvanian Daren Miller and his French in-laws. It is delicious, elegant, offering classic black currant flavors of Bordeaux, but with an extra depth and richness. Fine, elegant acidity to finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This juicy, fruity wine has red berry fruit and gentle tannins. Although ripe, it's not rich but attractive and likely to age quickly. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The nose on this bright red blend from Sanders Ridge is spicy and smoky with abundant red fruit, leather and tobacco. The cheery red fruits carry through on the palate as well with a plush, but pleasant demeanor. There's not a lot of structure or depth, but it's an easy, fun wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This intensely ripe wine is made predominantly from Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of Malbec and Merlot. Its waxy cherry, currant and blueberry flavers are laced wtih milk chocolate and smoky oak richness, a dash of high-toned acidity sparking on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Rich Bordeaux, with concentrated blackberry fruits and dry tannins. There is a dry core and intense acidity. The wine is ready to drink, but could mature for 1–2 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Hugely tannic at this stage, this dense and complex wine has great structure partnered with dark black fruit and licorice. There is forward bitterness, suggesting this wine needs aging. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"An attractively fruity wine, its tannins softened with sweet black plum flavors. The acidity gives a lift while the ripe feel of the wine gives it a broader base. Touches of toast add further complexity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe bramble, black cherry and berry notes are enticingly fragrant on this Merlot-based Bordeaux-blend. The palate is concentrated with cherry and berry flavors too, but more tart and crisp in profile, with a nervy cranberry acidity that reverberates on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine shows black currant fruit, with just the right balancing acidity. Talbot is progressing well in its quest to bring out its fine terroir."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a ripe, spicy and full-bodied wine from the Robin group of producers created by Grand Moulin's Jean-Francois Renaud in Blaye. The wine has both structure and rich blackberry fruit. The tannins are dusty, spicy and with fine acidity to balance. Drink this fine wine from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A big, ripe and juicy wine packed with black fruit notes and laced with acidity. The tannins offer a contrast to the fruitiness, bringing balance and structure. This is an impressive wine, the smoky aftertaste bringing out the wood aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Warm and rich, the wine from vineyards on the slopes above Cadillac have the structure of the vintage along with the ripe, blackberry fruits. It is already attractive to drink, and will continue to age nicely over the medium term."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Produced from a 17-acre vineyard, dominated by Merlot, this is the top wine of Château Renard. It is structured and firm with tannins and dense concentration that will probably remain with this rich wine as it matures. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc and 6% Merlot. This has fine grained tannins—not soft, but polished, ripe, and rich. Tasted prior to its official release, the wine was still pulling together all of the complex barrel-influenced flavors; it tasted delicious, with notes of bourbon-soaked cherries, along with veins of espresso, cacao, dusty baking spice, and a liquorous finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a dry wine, packed with tannins at this stage. With concentrated fruits and spice in the background, it will become a rich structured wine. This Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon wine was vinified for 12 months in French oak and six months in underground cement vats—aiming for drinkability for at least 10 years. But go ahead and drink the wine starting from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"After the promise of the wine at its initial barrel tasting, this bottled wine is less exciting. Berry fruits are muted by the extracted tannins. It's likely the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Continuing its impressive development, Clerc Milon 2011 is a serious wine. It is elegant, stylish, its fruits well integrated with red berry and plum skin flavors. Powerful while round and fruity with a fine sense of weight, this wine will develop relatively quickly but will then stay at its peak for many years. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Produced at Château Haut-Bailly, this concentrated red show the attractive fruit of 2011. It's tannins are relatively gentle, a fine counter-point to the red berry and currant fruits. It's a wine for medium-term aging over the next 4–6 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Minty wood flavors underline the fruitiness of this ripe wine. Structured and concentrated, it has density and some fine acidity to balance. Its fruit is backed by tannins that suggest a good future. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A wine from a château that is still finding its form . It is soft, open, with attractive juicy red fruits and black currants, ready to drink soon."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is principally Cabernet Sauvignon (52%), Merlot (35%), along with dollops of Petit Verdot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère. The aromas show complexity, with notes of herb, pink peppercorn, dark fruit, coffee and wood spice. The flavors are supple and layered, with bright acidity and firm tannins providing the frame."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"88-90 Barrel sample. Good, with dense tannins, a powerful wine that shows a rich structure. It has obvious acidity, but that fits into a fresh profile."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is smooth and lush, with its tannins softened by ripe berry fruit and a strong presence of spicy wood. It has weight, density and, on the finish, fruitiness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wood-aged wine is seriously rich and powerful, with some bitterness from extraction. Dark chocolate flavors and firm tannins dominate it now; the fruit is there, but submerged. Give it until 2020 before opening."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The concentration that Christian Roche produces here is immense, a wine that has dark tannins, the most bitter of chocolate flavors and peppered cherry fruits. Even after four years, this is nowhere open yet, the tannins and the heavy toast wood still dark and dry. Age for 3–4 years more."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This shows just how good Gimblett Gravels reds can be even at such a fair price point. Senior Winemaker Gordon Russell has fashioned a full-bodied, dark and dense wine that shows hints of vanilla and cedar which frame dark plum and cassis fruit, then slowly fade into a long, velvety finish. Drink 2020–2030."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The tannins are very fine, with rich fruitcake and smoky flavors. Red berry and black plums give a fruity character, along with delicious acidity. The wine is structured while still remaining very approachable."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Now maturing well, this is a wine that reflects much of the freshness of 2008, with firm tannins and solid structure. A black currant flavor dominates this elegant offering, providing acidity as well as freshness. It could age for another few years, but is ready to drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Dark fruit aromas and flavors join with a generous texture and full body to make a complete and satisfying wine. This has just enough tannin to make it appetizing and well balanced.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a blend of the five major Bordeaux varieties, based on Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows a weight and depth that Firestone Cabs don't often achieve, offering soft layers of black currants, cherries, cola, cinnamon, cloves, brown sugar and smoky sandalwood. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Rich, concentrated wine, with generous fruits and soft tannins. It has super-ripe black plums, a touch of chocolate and spice from wood aging. Powerful, juicy, fruity, likely to age well over the medium-term, over the next 3–4 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Bordeaux-style blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc is surprisingly open and accessible now, with forward aromas and flavors of ripe brambly berry, forest, fresh tobacco leaf and a touch of espresso bean. The fine tannins lend an approachable texture to the wine, with a rich, jammy black-fruit flavor lingering on the medium-length finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Produced by the winemaking team of Château Giscours in Margaux, this is impressive for a simple Bordeaux. It has weight, rich blackberry fruits, structure and concentration. It could even age."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Bordeaux blend is very dry and very tannic. There's something old-fashionedly rustic about it. With deep blackberry flavors, it may age, but it's not very hedonistic right now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Soft, very round, already approachable, the wine is flavored with spice, black berry flavors and sweet tannins. Juicy, ripe Merlot for medium-term aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Dominated by Merlot, this is a fruity wine with finely integrated tannins. It has the red fruits and acidity of the vintage given weight by 13 months of wood aging and the concentration of old vines. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Strong wood aromas lead to a wine that is still very young. The smoky wood character dominates the red berry fruits and typical acidity of the vintage. It does have the weight to develop well, so give this structured wine until 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of Merlot (45%), Cabernet Franc (33%) and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine offers aromas of cocoa, spice, flowers, herb and red and black fruit. The flavors show concentration and depth, along with a lovely sense of texture that keeps the interest high. The tannins give a light squeeze."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a dry wine, its fruit lost in the tannic structure. It has some fine acidity and could well open up as the young fruit matures. Try again from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a 40-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, with the balance consisting of Merlot. It's a barrel selection of the winery's best lots, from its various vineyards, and has been aged in 100% new French oak. Yet it's not oaky at all, with the wood bringing only additional sweet, smoky richness to the red currants, cherries, dark chocolate and spices. This is a superb wine, delicious right out of the bottle, but it should develop and, depending on your tastes, improve over the next 20 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Possibly the best Walter Clore to date, this is firm, with substantial dark-fruit flavors swathed in swirls of loam, blood, sweet tomato and red licorice. The relative coolness of the vintage seems to have allowed extra details to emerge, and the barrel aging has been handled sensitively."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Fruity and juicy, this has soft tannins and an open, gentle texture. It has red currant fruit that gives acidity, with only a touch of dry tannins on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a dry wine, firm with tense tannins and structured. It needs time to bring out the ripe fruits that are there. Big and concentrated, this wine inaugurated a new gravity-fed winery. Wait until 2019 to drink."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Dark and extracted, this has firm, dry tannins. It's hard edged, but the potential of the black currant fruit is apparent. Give this structured wine at least five years for the rich fruit to surface."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The wine has yeasty aromas although the fruit is all there. Red-berry flavors are cut with a tannic texture and enough acidity to balance. The wine will be better from the end of 2016.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Bordeaux blend from Sunstone has been getting softer, sweeter and more melted over the years. This latest bottling is almost like a dessert wine, with pastry-like cherry, currant, cocoa, anise and vanilla flavors. It lacks structure and full dryness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"93–95. Barrel sample. A complex and very successful wine, this shows rich tannins, dark fruits, a powerful texture of ripe blackberry fruits and spiced acidity. It will shine with some serious aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Showing the richness and structure of the 2010 vintage, this is an opulent wine, full of black fruits. It has a dark structure, smoky bacon flavors and powerful tannins. Ripe and generous, the fruit can cope with this structure. It does need to age, so drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Dry, certainly not softened by the rich 2003 vintage, but showing fresh fruit, black currants and dry tannins. It's restrained, finely balanced, drinkable now, leaving a soft final impression."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Wood aromas are repeated on the palate with a dry bitterness. This wine should soften as it develops, although that over-enthusiastic use of wood could remain. This is one of several Bordeaux estates owned by André Lurton."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A structured wine that gives pleasure from its ripe blackberry fruits as well as from its firm, food-friendly, spicy tannins. It has vibrant, vivid acidity that lifts the dense structure and gives an elegant feel to the close."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This classed growth is taking on a new life after years of not achieving its potential. With this vintage, the team from Château Chasse-Spleen has taken charge, and it shows in the structured density of the tannins, maybe edged with austerity, but also based upon rich, black fruits and a mouthful of vivid acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Hailing from one of the state's most esteemed vineyards, this wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (42%), Merlot (33%) and Cabernet Franc. Jammy aromas of red and black fruit and licorice lead to plush but well-balanced flavors that linger."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The wine from Bruno Martin is juicy with berry flavors in an 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon blend. The tannins are already well integrated into this ripe wine. Perfumed and lively with acidity, it is going to be a bright, fruity wine. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a fruity wine with red berry flavors and fresh acidity. It is crisp, light and ready to drink, with an attractive smoky aftertaste."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is the second wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion. It is rich with tannins and juicy with black-currant acidity. As befits a second wine, it is developing well and easily. Drink from 2021. While it shares the same name as Château Haut-Brion, there is no ownership or location connection between the two properties."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Floral red-fruit aromas are slightly medicinal and suggestive of cherry cough drop. A healthy, chewy mouthfeel and flavors of plum and raspberry end with textural solidity and modest refinement. This is an interesting mix of 55% Petit Verdot with Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc, and a dash of Malbec."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Juicy black currants and red berries are masked by the tannins at present, but they will fill out this wine, leaving a fresh, bright character. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,This is a potentially juicy wine with acidity and red fruits coming through the structure. It has the weight for the tannins and a rich background feel. Drink starting from 2018.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe black fruits combine with bitter chocolate and toast from the wood to give a very ripe wine. It is structured at this stage but is likely to ripen and round out over the next 3–4 years to give a rich, smooth, Merlot style."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"88-90 Barrel sample. Sweet vanilla aroma, fruit that is ripe, soft, fleshy. This seems to have suffered from super-mature, fruit, although a final juiciness does help."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The equivalent of an alternative second wine from Château Pichon Baron (with Les Tourelles), Les Griffons is named after the statues of griffins that are in the chateau's courtyard. This is a structured wine, firmly tannic while already showing plenty of black currant fruitiness. Equal measures of Merlot and Cabernet balance the wine and give depth of flavor. It will develop soon and will be drinkable from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Built upon generous, sweet and pretty cherry and cassis fruit, this drinks well now, but could be cellared until 2020. Tannins are ripe and polished, and the natural acidity carries a finishing lick of citrus."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Leathery aromas of horseradish and stewed berries lead to a rooty, syrupy palate. Flavors of cola, chocolate and raisin are creamy as a whole. This tastes ripe on the finish, with raisin and oxidized notes. This Merlot-Cabernet-Malbec blend has its strong points but comes across baked and raisiny."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine could be labeled a Cabernet Sauvignon, which makes up 83% of the blend, with the rest Merlot. The aromas of fruit leather, dried blackberry, black licorice and medicine cabinet are bright, though they seem considerably more evolved than the wine's age might indicate. The black-fruit flavors display a sense of balance that carries through the finish. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This powerful and ripe wine is a blend of juicy Merlot, perfumed Cabernet Franc and fruity Petit Verdot. It has weight, richness, layers of spice and peppered black plums. There are some tannins, but the wine is really ready to drink now until 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"An alluring nose of mint, mocha and blackberry leads into like flavors in this elegant, mouthwatering red blend from Zelma Long. Lush and unfolding, the wine offers ripe tannins and a long finish. Overall, balanced and confident."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"While juicy Merlot dominates this wine, the structure comes from the perfumed Cabernet Sauvignon that brings out the tannins, while the fruit is packed with blackberry flavors. This ripe wine needs to develop over the next few years. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Winemaker Ray Coursen is a Vietnam Vet, and this wine is made to honor other veterans of foreign wars. Soft, round and approachable on the palate, it's made from a majority of Merlot, with smaller additions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Cedar, currant and a sweetness of vanilla fan out on the palate."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is soft and subdued, inviting in its full-bodied embrace of vanilla. With all five red Bordeaux varieties involved, it makes an impact, showcasing rich red berry, cassis and cherry, while a dusting of clove spice finds length on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Continuing the great improvements at this estate, this 2010 is firm and solidly tannic, showing severity. As a contrast, it also shows acidity and black currant fruits that offer weight and richness. A balanced wine with a good future."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bright and fruity, this wine has fine acidity, which balances the firm tannins. The whole wine feels juicy, packed with forward fruit and having a lively character. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Profiting from the ripeness of the 2015 vintage, this 65% Merlot wine is rich and soft. The balance of Cabernet Franc in the blend lends spice, perfume and a fine tannic structure. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A solid, foursquare wine, flaunting its tannins but not forgetting the rich weight of fruit underneath. Mint flavors go with the chocolate and dark plums."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Viader has a long history of producing great Bordeaux-style blends grown at a high elevation on Howell Mountain. This 2010 is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with almost the same percentages as the superb 2009 bottling. The wine is rich, dry and complex. It shows a fantastic array of blackberries, dates and dark chocolate, with fascinating notes of lavender and dill. The tannins are gorgeous, the acidity fine, and the application of oak is deft. It's hard to describe just how good this wine feels in the mouth. Drink now, after decanting, or within the next 20 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"So smooth, this is a rich, grandiose wine. Although it is full of black currant fruits and spice flavors, the texture is most impressive. Dusty tannins are integrated with juicy fruits seamlessly. The purest fruit flavors are allied to linear tannins in a precise yet generous way. The wine is evolving beautifully, but do not drink before 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This blend is mostly Merlot (86%) along with Cabernet Franc, with the fruit coming from two of the state's top sites, Boushey and Champoux. Initially brooding raspberry compote, graphite and dried herb aromas are followed by supple, tart fruit and coffee flavors that sail on the finish. The balance is impeccable. It charms with its subtleties rather than its power, but make no mistake, it charms."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The wine has caramel flavors and a tannic structure to give a dry, bitter character. It is firm and tight and needs a few more months. Drink from late 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Conflict is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, and 8% Cabernet Franc. Smoke wreathes around deep cherry candy flavors, leading into some chewy tannins dusted with savory herbs."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"From one of three estates owned by the Moreaud family in one contiguous 61-acre property, this smooth and ripe wine is all about rich black fruits. Supported by just the right amount of tannin and acidity, it is already delicious and fruity. Drink now, but better to wait until the end of 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Very straight, firm, a wine that seems to be developing slowly. The blackberry fruits are impressive, rich and pure, and the tannins form a dense core of darkness. The wood is currently showing too strongly, but the fruit will certainly open out in a year or so. An impressive wine, but it needs time."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Almost entirely Merlot, this is a rich and fruity wine. Dusty tannins hang in suspension alongside the ripe blackberry fruits. The wine is juicy, fresh with acidity and likely to develop quickly. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This sturdy red is a blend of four Bordeaux grapes, with a tannic, earthy structure. It has the sort of rugged power that you'd look for in a café wine, ready to take on a juicy burger and some fries."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Merlot (44%) and Cabernet Franc (30%) make up the majority of this wine, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Aromas of baking spice and blue fruit are followed by cocoa powder and blue fruit flavors. It comes off as quite dry."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90-92 Barrel sample. Balanced, open wine, full of ripe blackcurrant fruits. It has a fine, rich density which shows well alongside the acidity of a young wine. It finishes with delicious black fruits."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A structured wine, this is full of firm tannins and has juicy fruit underneath. It has attractive acidity, some smoky flavors and a firm aftertaste. All this means the wine needs to develop, and it will be better to drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"87-89 Very cassis in character, with fruit, some weight and totally juicy acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"With some weight behind the firm tannins, this is beginning to develop into a dense and powerful wine. It has black plum and berry fruits and a layer of fresher strawberry juice. Throughout there are dry tannins to hold the structure together."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Named after the Pontac family which in the 18th century owned large swathes of Bordeaux and its vineyards, this estate is based around a former hunting lodge. The wine is ripe and full, finely structured and with tight still-young acidity. Drink from 2022."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This ripe, smooth and generous wine also has a good sense of elegance. Acidity, ripe berry and plum fruits and a core of tannins all hang together well to give a wine that's both dense and sophisticated. Drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"92-94 Big and tannic, very firm and tough. Yet all the fruit is there, offering great potential. There is a ripe, juicy aftertaste. Under the same ownership as Château Léoville-Poyferré in Saint-Julien."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of the two Cabernets and Merlot, the '04 Trilogy shows the wine's traditional elegance. The flavors are extremely ripe, suggesting blackberries, cherries and cocoa, with a sugared finish. Fully drinkable now due to the softness of the tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Once again, this Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend from Norton excels. The nose is a bit grapy and candied, but there's depth and a level of intensity that bodes well for the future. The palate is deep and concentrated, with blackberry, prune, stewed plum, graphite and coffee flavors in front of a mellow, smooth finish.  Drink now through 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Deftly calibrating sultry black fruit against savory earth tones, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc offers refinement. Toast, smoke and bramble integrate amid black plum and cherry flavors. The finish is powerful and persistent, fringed with finely grained tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Dense, powerful wine that impresses both with its rich fruit and its balanced tannins. The whole wine is finely integrated, black berry flavors shot through with acidity and touches of wood. Certainly a wine for aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"In the northern Margaux village of Soussans, Deyrem-Valentin produces a delicate wine, with simply structured blackberry jelly flavors, just edged with dark tannins. The flavors are sweet, ripe, open, not for aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The impressive Victorian baronial chateau of Cantenac Brown is one of the landmarks of Margaux. The wine is getting better each vintage. This is ripe and generous, full of freshly minted tannins and layers of wood over the ripe berry fruit. Drink this wine from 2024."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Should Bordeaux be 14%? Maybe, but not this wine. It is too big, dry, tannin-dominated and heavy. There is way too much extraction, and it shows in the bitter character."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc are in the blend, which saw one quarter new American oak. It's bone dry, a palate ripper, with a steely core of red berries and stiff, green tea tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Some wines are meant for immediate consumption. Others require age. This wonderful wine satisfies on both sides. It's softly rich and polished in tannins, with accessible blackberry, cassis and oak flavors. Yet it has the structure and depth to go for years. Now–2016, at least."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This big, fruity black-colored wine has ripe stone fruit flavors and firm, ripe tannins. There is structure, obvious aging potential as well as ripe, sweet juicy Merlot fruit flavors. Age for 5-6 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a delicious wine already, not powerful, but charming and elegant. The acidity and fruit are easy and bright, the tannins light but properly in balance. That suggests this is not for aging. It's already a pleasure to drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Richly structured, this is a wine with style and balance. It has plenty of firm tannins to contrasted with its juicy blackberry fruit. It needs some time to fill out. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Produced in the Entre-deux-Mers region, this light, fresh wine has young tannins and stalky black-currant flavors. It is crisp with lively acidity and a juicy aftertaste. Give it another few months and drink from late 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Made in a traditional, gravity-operated cellar with 100% Merlot from a densely planted vineyard, this is an impressive wine that manages to tread a fine line between considerable richness and a more restrained, dry tannin and fresh fruit character. Although it does quickly fall apart with decanting or air, it is worth aging, for at least 3–4 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"As rich as this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is, and it is extraordinarily rich, there's something standard about it. It's as though the ripeness of the fruit has obliterated any trace of terroir. Offers a fantastically sweet explosion of blackberries, cherries, plums and chocolate, alongside caramelized, butterscotchy oak, but beyond the sheer power, the wine isn't displaying much subtlety. Hard to tell where it's going, if anywhere."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This offers black currant flavors and firm, stalky tannins. It has acidity, a good juicy character and a dry aftertaste. Drink from 2015."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This blend of 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Malbec, 20% Petit Verdot, 12% Cabernet Franc and 12% Merlot is very approachable on the nose with blackberry and black-pepper aromas. The palate also offers the black fruit with a touch of purple flowers, but it is somewhat simple and weak, especially compared to this winery's other bottlings."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Beneath the surface tannins is great Merlot fruit, very ripe and full-bodied, a powerhouse of flavors. The depth and complexity of the wine is all there, along with a dark core of dryness. A wine for long-term aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Stylish wine, balanced, intensely elegant. It has freshness and also weight, encased in a structure that is poised, beautifully integrating black currant fruit and chocolate flavors."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of the five major Bordeaux varieties, this is a deliciously soft wine. So easy to like for its rich blackberry, cherry, raspberry and smoky oak flavors, courtesy of 40% new barrels. Shows lots of class for the price."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"It's a shame that the producer used too much wood in this difficult vintage. The fruit is delicate, with the black-currant flavors and acidity smothered by a burnt, toasty character that's hard to taste through. It will soften, although the wood will always be there. Vignobles Roux bought this Cru Bourgeois in 2013. The blend is 50-50 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A dense wine that is showing signs of heavy extraction, with dark chocolate and bitter flavors. In a vintage with crisp fruitiness being the defining factor, it is a bit of a shame. The dark edge needs to mellow before the wine can balance out."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"92-94. Barrel sample. A ripe and spicy wine, with crisp fruit. The wine has an attractive fruitiness, and its tannins are not aggressive. This shows great final acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Big, heavy, extracted, tannic and dry. That pretty much sums up this blend of all five Bordeaux varieties, with Petit Verdot in the majority. It's potent in blackberry and black currant flavors, with an undertow of minerals. Should age well over the next eight years, without necessarily becoming more distinguished."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Very structured wine that shows its wood aging as well as textured black plum fruits. It has spice, toast and a smoky character. Underneath are blackberry fruits and a strong layer of acidity. Age for 3–4 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"From one of the properties followed by the Marmande cooperative at the northern end of the Southwest region, this wine has black currant fruits that are filled out with some firm tannins. After five years, it is obvious that the tannins will remain, leaving a wine that is dry and stalky in character."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A small portion, the flower (la Fleur) of the Peyrabon vineyard, is in the Pauillac appellation. Richly structured, this wine is full of black currant and berry fruit, with solid tannins. Dense on the palate, it shows ripe Cabernet Sauvignon juiciness. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"89-91 Barrel sample. The wine has a rustic edge, over very juicy fruit, very blackcurrant, and with a high acid content. It feels light."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Firm and complex, it manages both acidity and concentrated tannins and brings out really black fruits."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This rich and rounded wine comes from the flat lands of Saint-Émilion, giving it a soft and gentle feel. Acidity and ripe black fruits dominate the light structure. It's a wine for medium-term aging, ripe and ready to drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, this approachable blend shows pretty cherry, strawberry, a touch of earth and barnyard, and a gently fading finish. Drink young for its freshness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This rich wine, produced from old vines, is dense and concentrated. It does have the fruitiness of the vintage but that is allied to the dark-black fruit and powerful tannins. There are spice and wood flavors still developing. Drink this fine wine from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This blends 84% Merlot, 11% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot, the three varieties combining to full-bodied effect. Earthy in mushroom and cedar, its texture is leathery, with the palate dotted in tobacco and black pepper, the character savory and full of spice."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Weight and dense tannins go with the firm black fruits and acidity, producing a wine that is spicy, fruity and likely to age quickly. Drink from 2015."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is well-balanced and ripe, with plenty of room for both the attractive black fruits and the firm tannic structure. Wood aging shows, although it will integrate well. The wine is fruity, likely to be ready to drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90-92 Densely characterized wine, with its dark tannins, and powerful structure. Spice, juicy pepper, final acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This bold, ripe wine is full of tannins as well as great fruit. Juicy with black currant flavors, smoky from wood aging and rich with tannins, it's finely structured and ready to mature gently. Drink from 2021."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A wine that appears almost too delicious at this stage. Through the black fruit and sweet tannins, the texture is immediately attractive. However, there is a dense structure behind this open exterior that should see it age well."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux-style blend is very rich and ripe in blackberries, cherries and currants. It has smooth tannins, and the finish is dry. It's a fashionable wine that feels plush in the mouth, but young. Give it 3–4 years, but it doesn't seem to have the stuffing for the long haul."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A big, ripe and smoky wine, it displays a fruity, juicy undertow. It is developing well, giving great black currant fruitiness, some dense tannins and final acidity. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This austere wine broods on its black fruits and comes up with a dry character. The structure is the main element, tied into minerality, black plum skins, only showing freshness and juicy fruits on the vivid finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Rocky aromas meet with pure blackberry and other concentrated black fruits on the ripe but nowhere near sweet nose of this blend of 56% Cabernet Franc and 44% Merlot. Lavish flavors of blackberry, lilac, caramel and crushed gravel show on the zesty palate, but the star of this bottling is the chalky, fine-tuned structure. Drink 2018–2028."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"McKinley Springs vineyard sourced this outstanding blend of Cabernet Franc (45%), Cabernet Sauvignon (36%) and Merlot (19%). A complex and inviting, dusty bouquet of herb, olive and tart fruits introduces a wine with smooth moves and subtle details. A perfect mix of Washington fruit with a Bordeaux grip."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The aromas of tobacco leaf, herbs, milk chocolate, vanilla and dark cherries are generous on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Aromas and flavors of rhubarb and red pepper dominate, resulting in a wine that is sharp and unbalanced."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Lots of ripe blackberry, black cherry and cocoa flavors in this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend. But the tannins are a bit sharp and green, giving the wine a bite that won't age out."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is firm, solid and strongly tannic in nature. Juiciness is there, along with wood aging, spice and some concentration. The acidity is very present and needs to soften over the next year. Drink from 2015."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this deep violet-red wine has a nose of black cherry, crème brulée and black pepper. Cool and fruity notes play well together on the palate, shored up by flavors of black cherry, orange zest, menthol, clove and a touch of seawater. Mevushal."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,This is a seriously wood-aged wine. Its burnt toast character doesn't chime with the light fruitiness of the vintage and so gives a wine that is bitter and extracted. Less overworking would have produced a better wine.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"While this wine shows some of the softness and richness of 2003, it keeps a light touch and the acidity and black fruits remain fresh. There is an edge of astringency that leaves a hard aftertaste."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"With too much smoky toast, this gives a hard, extracted feel with licorice rather than fruit. Tannins are dense and hints of juicy fruitiness only appear in the background."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Black cherry to the eye, this wine holds back on the nose, offering restrained aromas of black currant and roasted yellow pepper. Flavors include raspberry, blueberry, violet, lavender, thyme and roasted meat. It has lightly grippy tannins and there is a distinct note of Dr. Pepper on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a small estate of 12 acres dominated by its 95% Merlot. It is ripe and juicy with spice, dried fruits and crisp black currants. The tannins are already well integrated with the fruitiness. Drink from late 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This 1,000-acre estate with 140 acres of vines is close to Bordeaux and still family owned. With bitter chocolate flavor lying over the fruit, this needs some aging before it can properly integrate. Dark tannins and spice show at the end, along with juicy black-currant fruit. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90-92 Beautifully perfumed wine, the tannins relatively gentle. It has packed weight, as well as ripe berry fruits."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of 60% Cabernet Franc, 30% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a soft, red-fruited wine, with lively aromas and flavors of cherry, plum and currant, all laced with hints of tobacco leaf, toast and bittersweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is creamy and the tannins fine and fleeting."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This warm, ripe wine is full of forward black fruits and just the right amount of firm tannins to balance. A smoky character comes from wood aging. Lightly structured, it is ready to drink."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The wine feels very dense, juicy, dark and concentrated. It has a huge feel to it, a powerful wine that will need several years to fully soften and round it. And, At 15.5% alcohol, this is way too heavy for a Bordeaux."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Dense, concentrated and firm, this wine has a powerful, rich structure that promises well. Big berry fruits and dark tannins are developing well together. The wine is full of promise so drink from 2020. Fifteen-percent of the 74 acres of vines are more than 120 years old. New York banker Robert G. Wilmers bought Haut-Bailly in 1998 from the Sanders family, owners since 1955. Véronique Sanders-van Beek has run the estate since then."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This small estate is wedged between some of the classed growths of Pauillac. Firm and structured, the wine is solid with tannins and backed with concentrated blackberry fruits. The 60% Cabernet in the blend gives great acidity as well as the tannins. These two elements will allow the wine to age, so drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"With 90% Merlot, this is a full supple wine from the eastern end of Saint-Emilion. There are tannins that support the perfumed blackberry fruit and the balanced acidity. The wine is ready to drink now, although it will be better from 2017."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"While the wine does have considerable tannins, it also has the ripe Merlot fruit to support it. Good acidity, black currant fruits, smoky wood, all the elements are there. It will always be firm, but should mature well."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The tannins on this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend are strong. They numb the mouth, but not so much that you can't enjoy the ripe black currant, cassis and smoky oak flavors. With its inherent balance, the wine should have no trouble aging, so give it eight years in the cellar."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc (40% each) with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this Stillwater Creek Vineyard wine has aromas of graphite, fresh herbs, dark coffee and cherry.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"From vineyards across both Napa and Sonoma, this blends 67% Cabernet Sauvignon with 16% Petit Verdot, 15% Merlot and 2% Malbec. It's structured and herb-driven, with ample ripeness. Black fruit and cedar flavors dominate through the lengthy, peppery finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Primarily Merlot, with 18% Cabernet Sauvignon (from the Bacchus vineyard) filling out the blend. Lovely aromatics open into a high acid red with raspberries and plums. It profits from extended breathing time, though ultimately fades away into a somewhat chalky finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of just over two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon along with Merlot (26%) and Petit Verdot (7%), this wine beguiles with its brooding aromas of spice, toffee, dark fruit and scorched earth. The flavors are layered, bringing a real sense of gravitas along with a compelling mouthfeel and sense of balance. The black-fruit flavors linger. It's all about finesse."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Considering the relatively light nature of the vintage, this wine has been overmanipulated. Hard tannins and a bitter chocolate flavor are all too much for the fruit. A gentler approach would have been better."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a lean wine, all tannins and missing fruit. It is dry and showing considerable hard extraction. It will soften, but not much."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"91-93. Barrel sample. Ripe and spicy, with delicious open fruit, this wine is rounded yet has a straight line of pure acidity. It has a light touch while showing depth of flavor for the future."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a structured wine that still has serious layers of ripe fruit and rich tannins. The black currant from the Cabernet Sauvignon is balanced by the jammy richness of the delicious Merlot. It's an impressive wine that continues the progress of this estate, owned by Lafite-Rothschild. Drink from 2024."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"You can tell the age from the color and the faded mushroom flavors on the palate. It does merit some passing interest as a wine from the very hot 2003 vintage, but that's about all."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Lean and tough, this is all hard edges. The wine has an austere character that's likely to be off-putting even in the future."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine has potential, with ripe berry fruits and soft tannins that are already well integrated. It is dense, showing a structure that will broaden out as the wine ages. Drink this juicy, fruity wine from Vignobles Dulon from 2016."

The concentrated berry and cassis fruit is annotated with barrel notes of vanilla, coffee and tobacco. This is a hand-crafted wine with distinctive, albeit somewhat rustic, appeal."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Layers of new wood dominate the aromas and flavor of this wine. They smother the fruit leaving a question mark over its future.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Although not labeled as such, this is 98% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Petit Verdot.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe and perfumed, this is packed with the richness of 2010 along with its structure. It has weight, juicy black and red berry fruits and a tense structure that still needs time. Acidity at the end provides a fresh lift to the essentially firm wine."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Coda displays fresh and bright raspberry fruit. The acids come with a crisp snap, and there's an overall juiciness that makes it especially quaffable."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Meaty and leathery on first blush, with chunky dark-fruit aromas leading to a beefy palate with pure plum and blackberry flavors.

Blended from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, it holds subtle complexity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Brander's annual Bordeaux blend features 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. There is ripe boysenberry, cedar and worn leather on the nose, followed by Bing cherry flavors on the palate, where acidity and a light body combine for a lively finish."

Seductively accessible, this world class wine will age well for 6–12 years or longer."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Rich already, this wine is darkly tannic and powered by solid tannins. The weight of fruit behind the tannins also brings out acidity and black currant flavors. It will remain dry but well structured and with good fruitiness. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Plum and cherry fruit show on the nose of this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 10% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot, but an iodine character adds a counterpoint to the fruit. Deep black fruit shows on the palate, meshing with savory spice and lifted by boisterous acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"With firm tannins as well as juicy black-currants, this is an attractive wine. It has plenty of acidity which is balanced by the ripe fruitiness. Drink from 2018."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This densely packed and very firm-textured wine will need aging to show its full potential.

A welcome sense of austerity keeps it from seeming sweet, and it features an elegant balance. Best after 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is a blend of Merlot (44%), Cabernet Sauvignon (34%) and Cabernet Franc. Fragrant aromas of raspberries, orange peel, red currant and garden herbs lead to restrained but sumptuous fruit flavors backed by a lick of tart acidity. It brings a sense of presence and depth."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Château du Cros began life in the 12th century, commanding a superb military vantage point over the Garonne river. The surrounding vineyards have produced a fresh and fruity Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend with a mineral bite that gives a strong sense of structure. Its weight and a firm texture act as a foil to the juicy red berries and attractive acidity. The wine is almost drinkable now but will be better from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"An attractively balanced, fruity wine that shows to advantage the crisp lightness of 2007. There are red fruits, berries, raspberries, given structure by a core of dry tannins. The acidity and spice roll together in the final taste, with just an edge of green."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Floral berry and plum aromas are also saucy and oaky, and thus discordant. A wobbly tannic palate with green herbal oaky blueberry flavors tastes grassy on the finish. If you know Casarena's wines, this fits the mold."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"93–95. Barrel sample. Powerful and concentrated, this is a firmly textured wine with a dark, solid, dense character. The palate balances fine acidity and fruit with a dark, brooding structure."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The aromas are fruit forward and pleasing, with notes of plum, spice, tangerine peel, dark fruit and green herbs. The palate brings a sense of elegance and subtlety, showing a deft touch."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This smells dark and bold, offering Port-like aromas of chocolate ganache, buttercream frosting, brown spice and sun-baked fruit. Hearty and toasty, the palate packs plenty of muscle in the form of strapping tannins and supporting acids. Pair this with seared flank steak with a coffee-soy rub to accent the wine's decadence."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Flavors of bitter extraction spoil this wine, giving an unnecessarily hard character and masking the fruit. It probably will not soften much. The blend is 79% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Cabernet Franc. Produced by Alliance Bourg."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The nose on this wine starts a bit grape-jelly clunky, but on the palate, an appealing balance of fruit, pepper, oaky spice and minerals triumphs. The wine has class and structure and will be great paired with grilled meat or richer dishes."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90-92. Barrel sample. With all the freshness of the year, this wine is ripe and soft. It has acidity and juicy black-currant flavor. The wine is spiced, with its ripe tannins well integrated."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The second wine of Château Chauvin is a structured, perfumed wine with its high proportion of Cabernet Franc giving much of its potential richness and spice. The tannins are solid and will always show well as an integral part of this complex wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is dark, with a dominant wood flavor that covers the potentially ripe fruit. It is full of firm tannins, with a flavor of bitter chocolate. It may be that this wine will always have too much dry wood."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90-92 Rich and fruity, a real juice bomb of a wine that has black currant and spice fruit to go with its solid, well-integrated tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Confusingly, the wine has no connection with Château Magnol, also owned by Barton & Guestier. It's a soft Médoc wine, light and gentle in character, the tannins soft, merging with the red berry fruits."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Produced from young vines, this is the third wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion. As such, it is very accessible with its ripe, red exuberant fruits. The tannins are in the background, giving the necessary structure to a wine that will age quickly. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"At this stage, a wine that is dominated by wood. The weight and the ripe fruit are there as well to suggest potential dark fruits, black plums, damsons and a juicy character. The rich fruit should begin to show well in a year, but the wine needs aging 3–4 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Light, fruity and fragrant, this is an attractive, crisp wine that highlights red-berry fruits and soft acidity. It's a wine to drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe fruit and balanced acidity allow this wine to make room for touches of wood aging. It has spice, a smoky character and attractive finishing freshness. Drink from 2017 when the wine will be fully balanced."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Elegant and tightly wound kirsch, crème de cassis, charred beef and toffee aromas show on the nose of this blend of 55% Merlot and 45% Cabernet Sauvignon. Its toffee flavor is laced with chocolate and charcoal on the palate, and its sticky tannins need time to smooth out. Drink 2019–2029."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Structured wine with 30% of Cabernet to give shape to the very ripe Merlot. The wine has both acidity, some firm tannins and a concentrated, dry core. It's likely to age well over 3–4 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot, this wine offers a bouquet that is equal parts black plum and green pepper. Fruit holds sway over chalky tannins, with flavors of black cherry and raspberry that are joined by chocolate covered espresso bean and green pepper notes."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Spring Valley wines have never been shy and retiring, but here the alcohol – 15.2% – seems to quickly mute the textural subtleties. Though it suggests a panoply of red and black fruits in the nose, the palate is a wash of coffee, toast, tannin and alcohol. The flavors get muddy and the alcohol strips the wine of its terroir."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"91-93. Barrel sample. Initially severe, this wine shows weight coupled with firm, dry tannins. Dense and complex black-currant flavors dominate."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This blend is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% each Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Complex old-vine characteristics emerge in a graceful, lengthy, detailed and subtle wine that weaves together herb, tobacco, olive and brambly berries. Drink now–2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Structured and austere, this is firm, dark and dry. The black currant fruit flavors are edgy, with juiciness only coming through right at the end."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a fruity wine with a black currant flavor. As a contrast, the tannins offer a denser side, creating a food-friendly wine with fine dryness and a smoky flavor."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Under new ownership, Prieuré-Lichine continues its rapid quality improvement. The wine is concentrated, with dark tannins and brooding fruit, dominated by new wood. It is rich, but also structured for a steady development over 10-15 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Still with its young tannins intact, the wine is firm and structured. It has spice, mint and black-currant fruits under the tight texture. It will still age so wait, if you want, for another year."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A ripe perfumed wine with fine tannins as well as dense fruit. Blackberry flavors are up there along with the acidity and crisp aftertaste. It's a wine with a good future, ready to drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Rounded and rich, this generous, full-bodied wine comes from a single parcel in the heart of Saint-Émilion. Black fruits are structured with dense tannins and a firm tension between ripeness and dryness. The wine is powerful, finishing with pepper and spice. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The wine is lean with austere tannins and plenty of structure. What is seems to be missing is the fruit potential. It will soften over time, although probably not enough."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is dry, structured and heavily extracted. That leaves a bitter note behind the fruit and acidity. It could have benefited from more gentle winemaking, and although it will soften with age, it will always be tough."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is light and fruity, well balanced with plenty of red berry flavors and only light tannins. It will be fresh and ready to drink from late 2016. The 30-acre vineyard on one of the appellation's highest spots was bought in 2009 by Denis Durantou, the owner of Château l'Église Clinet in Pomerol."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Attractive structured tannins and red fruits give this wine a good start in life. With the acidity, the dusty structure and the perfumed aftertaste, the wine will develop well. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"89-91 Barrel sample. Powerful, but smooth, with ripe milk chocolate and sweetness. Very velvet in texture, with just enough acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Almost equal proportions of Merlot and Cabernet Franc have given a beautifully perfumed wine. It has quite a structure for a second wine, although this is balanced with the intense black fruits. The touches of wood have given this wine its light spice flavor. Drink from 2023."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Firm and closed this is a dark and tannic wine, although black currant flavors are also very present. It feels austere with a mineral texture and concentrated final acidity. Drink Lafite's second wine from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Still showing its tannins, this wine is developing well. It is relatively light in texture, the sweet berry fruits balanced with a layer of acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Crimson is half Merlot, one-third Cab Franc, the rest a mix of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. There's some volatility in the nose, with bright, spicy strawberry fruit swathed in light chocolate. The midpalate drops out."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Holding 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot, this wine leads with inviting aromas of blackberries, dark cherries and tar, showing a fresh, fruit-forward profile. The dense fruit flavors deliver on all of this promise with layers of complexity, spot-on balance and good length."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The second wine from the Saint-Julien estate, this is every bit as elegant as the grand vin, its black currant fruit developing to envelop the fine tannins. There is fine fruit, plenty of acidity and a rich texture. It needs time, so drink from 2020."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90-92 Barrel sample. Fruity, attractively balanced wine, the spice and caramel wood flavors fitting well into the sweet, berry fruits."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is ready to drink with its ripe black fruits and soft structure. A tannic edge keeps the berry fruits in order, allowing the juicy acidity also to shine. At the end, the wood aging shows along with the black currant fruit."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This richly fruity wine is attractively balanced, showing ample acidity, black currant fruit and a general forward fruitiness. It's not a wine of great depth. Ready to drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot all coming from a single vineyard site. It's wound up tightly at present, with aromas of herb, dark fruit, spice and earth. The palate is big and bold, with rich fruit flavors and a firm lick of tannins. Best from 2024–2030."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend driven predominantly by Petit Verdot, with lesser percentages of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this wine is soft and spicy, with waves of blackberry flavor. Brightly balanced, it finishes in a mix of cola and clove, the tannins well under control."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Preuillac continues to out-perform its appellation with a rich, full wine that has structure and balanced wood-aging flavors. Nearly 60% Merlot, it is rich while showing a more firmly tannic character with the Cabernets in the blend. Black currant crispness is still in a dry mood and needs to age. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Dense and dry, this is a tough, extracted wine. It has a hard edge followed by juicy acidity and will probably remain on the dry side."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"93-95 Barrel sample. At this stage, the wood element is overpowering. You have to imagine the fruit, but the weight of the wine suggests it is there. Big, solid and chunky, it is the product of very ripe fruit."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is a blend of the five Bordeaux varieties. It's aromatically reserved, with notes of flowers, high-toned herbs, wood spice and dark fruit, but it's not yet fully ready to reveal its charms. The flavors are dark and dense, with chewy, lightly dry tannins providing support. The finish stretches-out."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Rich, full and dense, this shows considerable elegance as well as power. The fruits are black, with a strong edge of acidity, but also concentrated. There is a smooth layer of wood that adds to the complexity as well as opening the wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"In 1999, Stéphane and Paola Gabard resurrected winemaking at an estate that has belonged to the family since the 18th century. Ripe, rich and still retaining its youthful structure, this concentrated wine will need time. With its dense texture and layers of black-currant fruit, it has a fine future. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Toasted oak scents of espresso and char coat the underlying blackberry note. Although the palate is lax, the acidity becomes heightened as the wine unfurls across the palate. A pleasant note of raspberry coulis marks finish. A blend of Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon."

But it also shows plentiful black-currant flavor, layered with acidity. Classic and serious, this is a wine for aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Powerful, concentrated wine, a very solid Cabernet-dominated wine. It has dark tannins, the black currant fruit still hiding in the background. Dark and dense, it's destined for good aging, at least over the next six years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Mint aromas dominate notes of new wood aging on this wine. Toast notes are there, but blend harmoniously with berry flavors and acidity. Taken as a whole, this wine has weight and potential. Drink from 2015."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is a best-of-barrels selection from Summers' various Cabs throughout Napa Valley. It's unquestionably a big wine, densely packed with blackberry, cherry and dark chocolate flavors. It's also very young. The tannins pack a real punch. New oak, to the tune of 100%, is apparent in the buttered toast richness. Don't drink it now, good as it is. Give it until 2014, and it will develop long beyond that."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"92–94. Barrel sample. With so much spicy fruit, intensely ripe blackberry flavors and solid tannins, all the elements of excellence are here, and powered by a firm structure. This wine has weight and a fine Cabernet concentration."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"At a full 91% of the blend, this could be labeled as Cabernet Sauvignon, with Cabernet Franc rounding it out. It's shut down aromatically at present with assorted dried herbs poking through. The palate brings highly structured fruit flavors, with vibrant acidity tying it all together. Decant for a day if drinking in the near term; it will be best after 2022."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Black cherries and chocolate combine on the palate, but there's also a certain weediness to the aromas. This blend of approximately 60% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon finishes strong, with tart fruit and a dose of chocolate."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The tannins of this firm wine are softening well to give richness as well as structure. With juicy black currants, it is going to be a solid, dense wine. This is the second wine of the family-owned Grand Pontent which is managed by a member of the Bécot family of classed growth Beauséjour-Bécot. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux blend is very fine, but young. It needs time to allow the aggressive tannins to resolve and for the blackberry, black currant and herb flavors to emerge. New oak adds a sweet smokiness that will become an integral part of the final wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (61%), Merlot (25%) and Cabernet Franc, the aromas of spice, graphite, vanilla, and dried and fresh herbs are all high toned, with the fruit seeming subdued. The flavors are pitch-black, displaying the warmth of the vintage while keeping its heat in check."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a structured, firm wine that has tense tannins and acidity. It is smoky with a dry core. The fruit is just not there."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"High-toast aromas are followed on the palate by flavors that are more about wood than fruit. That gives the wine a tough, extracted character that probably will not go away."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Hard to believe this Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux-style blend is nearly six years old. It's still bitingly tannic. There's a huge core of blackberry and cocoa fruit that's slowly showing aged notes, but those tough tannins will never go away before the fruit fades. Drink up."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The wine, with its firm tannins and solid structure, is still young. The hints of black-plum fruits are way behind the structure. That's all good, because this wine will come together well, to give a rich full wine with spice, juicy black fruits and acidity. Drink from 2020."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Tight tannins support a blend of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon with 21% Petit Verdot, 11% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc. Black fruit, tobacco and leather give it a robust profile, finishing full bodied and ripe."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90-92. Barrel sample. While certainly powered by tannins, this wine does have a rich, fruity character as well. The finish brings juicy flavors that cut right through the tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A remarkably rich, spicy, attractive red. It obviously has new wood, but its use is judicious, leaving the mint, black berry and soft tannins of the fruit to come through well."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Cabernet Franc and 7% Merlot, this wine has a bouquet of black cherry, black plum and saddle leather. It is fruit forward on the palate, with flavors of cherry and cherry cola joined by notes of baking spice that continue into the soft but persistent finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Young, intense and briary, with summer herb notes of anise framing ripe, spicy blackberries. Oak adds a rich, deft touch of sweet char. The tannins are considerable and brooding, giving this dry young wine an astringent tightness. Shows all the hallmarks of ageability. 45% Merlot, 43% Petit Verdot 7% Cabernet Franc, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Lafite's second wine is much closer to a balance of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that the first wine. It's also a properly rich, satisfying wine that is as much fruit as structure. Packed with blackberry fruits, it has a fresh character that dominates the firmer tannins and touch of bitter chocolate. Drink from 2020."

The estate itself was created in the 6th century and is under the same ownership as neighboring Château Cissac. The wine is dark colored with intense flavor.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"91-93 Firm while also rounded, very rich Merlot spice and blackberry character. There are hugely dense, extracted tannins, with a final dark fruit character."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is 38% Cabernet Franc, 26% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 14% Petit Verdot.

The palate is reserved in style, with a smooth feel and a firm squeeze of lightly dry tannins on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A finely made wine, full of firm tannins and rich fruit. Structured and dark, it has weight, black fruit and great potential. With wood aging smoothing the bold fruit, it can be drunk soon, but will age well. Drink from 2014."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"While wood aging is an integral part of fine Bordeaux, with this wine it is just too much. While it is young, the wood, raw and dominant, submerges the fruit to give a wine that is dense, very dry and hard at the edges. It's not likely to ever lose this quality."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"There's lots of lush Cabernet Sauvignon character in this smooth Bordeaux blend. It has the all-important quality of impeccable texture, as soft as velvet, yet firm in minerals. With about one-third Cabernet Franc, it shows flavors ranging from cherries and currants to sweet cassis liqueur, with a complex veneer of new French oak. Beautiful to drink now, and it should age effortlessly for the next 10 years."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Alienor Grand Vin hails from Kelseyville, in Lake County, a fine place for Bordeaux varieties. A blend of 51% Merlot, 48% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot, this is highly structured with a lot of herbal intensity. The typical fruit forwardness of many California reds is subdued; the wine may need time for the fruit to make its way through."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"92–94. Barrel sample. While initially severe with chocolate and dark coffee flavors, ripe fruitiness comes through on the mid palate. It's full bodied and dense in tannins, but a solid wine showing the continuing development of this property."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with a sizable addition of Merlot and smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, The Discussion is lovely in spicy black pepper and clove, full bodied and softly integrated in terms of tannin and oak.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Firm, tense and dryly tannic, this is a solid wine, foursquare, its edges a little rough at present. The berry fruits are black, spicy from wood, creating a rich feel. In the end, black currant acidity and freshness finish the wine with a lift."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This blend of Merlot (45%), Cabernet Sauvignon (38%) and Cabernet Franc doesn't seem fully ripened with notes of bell pepper, dry chocolate, cherry and licorice. The tannins are dry and rustic with a scratchy feel."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Full and rich, this has flavors of spice, juicy black currant and mulberry, with a fine tannin backdrop and a dry core. The wood aging has smoothed the fruity finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Deceptively silky and elegant in texture, so much so that its power is easy to overlook.

They donate one percent of their turnover to an environmental charity and are (they say) one of only two wineries in the world who are members of “1% for the planet.”"
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Intensely acidic wine, its red fruits and caramel hidden behind a tart, over-lemoned flavor. For lovers of mouth-shockingly dry rosé. Screwcap."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine needs air in order to get at its dark-fruit aromas. In the mouth, this blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cab Franc is ripe but smacks down hard with tannins. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and herbs end with complex notes of graphite and chalk. This gets better the more time you spend with it. Drink through 2024."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is a blend of Two Blondes Cabernet Franc (50%), Benches Merlot (34%) and Dionysus Cabernet Sauvignon.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bay leaf, tomato leaf, green peppercorns, loamy mud and a slight touch of pasilla chile show on the nose of this blend of 48% Merlot, 38% Cabernet Franc, 9% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot. Peppery spices dominate the palate, including hints of Mexican mole sauce, making for a very intriguing and elegant wine."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A fine vein of graphite extends through this bold yet refined Bordeaux-style red. It's robustly fruity, bursting with cranberry, red cherry and raspberry flavors, but enticingly savory as well, nuanced by hints of leather and balsamic vinegar. Dense tannins should smooth out between 2018 and 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Firm and solid tannins with a dry core offers a dark character and density. Along with this, the wine has a ripe, fruity character that's packed with acidity and layered with wood."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Amazingly lush and delicious in blackberry and cherry pie, mocha and sweet new-oak flavors, this blend is also tannic to the point of being undrinkable at this time. You definitely want to give it until at least 2022 in the bottle."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"87—89 Barrel sample. Plenty of  fresh blackcurrant flavors here, in a wine that is charming, with its ripe fruits and lively acidity. The fruit is open, dominating the tannins. An early developer."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Full bodied, with structured tannins and bright acids, this has flavors of black cherry, dark berry and dried flower. A note of spiced black fruit adds interest to the medium-to-long finish. This would pair well with softly spiced chili or barbecue."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,This tough wine has overripe fruit. There are tough extracted tannins. It's a hard wine to like.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is a blend of 59% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc, 4% Malbec, 2% Petit Verdot and 2% Syrah. The aromas seem a bit off, with notes of dried cherry, oregano, anise and medicine cabinet. The palate has a pleasing sense of restraint and elegance, with gamy notes on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90-92 Barrel sample. Great density here, this wine is big and powerful, but all held together by rich fruit. It is concentrated, the dry tannins a part of a richer whole."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"With 20% of Cabernet Franc in the blend, this is a finely perfumed wine. It has a firm texture along with juicy black fruit and some lively acidity. The 70-acre vineyard faces Saint-Émilion across a small valley. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"With smoky aromas and structured tannins, this is still young and firm. Under those tannins, the black currant fruit is developing to give a ripe wine with fine acidity and structure. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A terrific wine, smooth, complex and ageworthy. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon from Diamond Mountain, it shows mountain intensity of fruit, with a molten core of blackberries and black currants. The tannins are bigtime, yet smooth and refined in the modern style, and the finish is elaborate in fruits and spices. A monument to what this fine winery can achieve at the top level. Hold until 2015, after which it should provide great drinking for additional years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"91-93 Rich fruit currants and berries, intensely juicy, packed with dark very ripe fruit. A powerhouse of berries."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The aromas are of wood as much as fruit. While the palate also shows plenty of wood aging flavors, there is also a more floral, red berry fruit character that's already attractive. The acidity at the end gives intense freshness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The second wine of Château du Tertre, this is produced by the winemaking team of the associated Château Giscours. It delivers the same elegance and sophistication with a more approachable fruitiness. Generous red and blackberry fruits are accompanied by concentration and some firm, smoky tannins. Drink this wine from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe, full in the mouth and with a smooth, already silky texture, this is a generous wine. Its ripe blackberry fruits are juicy, while the tannins are soft and cushioned by the ripe fruits. This is a wine that will develop well, so drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"An arresting blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62%), Merlot (27%) and Cabernet Franc, it displays purity with its herb, bay leaf, earth and cherry flavors. The exquisite balance is where this wine really shines, winning over on its elegance, detail and length rather than power. It shows first-class fruit and exceptional winemaking."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Warm and rounded, this is a soft, ripe rosé. The flavors of plums and red berries roll easily around the mouth, producing a wine that is full, rich and soft."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This 90-acre vineyard has produced an attractive, light wine. Fruity with red-berry flavors, it is already soft and fresh. Acidity and touches of tannin are balanced enough for the wine to be ready to drink."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A wine with light tannins and juicy red fruits. Though the acidity is prominent, it has a soft texture and attractive strawberry fruit flavors. Not for aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is soft and juicy with 12 months in barrel. It has rounded tannins and perfumed berry fruits. What it misses is the acidity, leaving an unbalanced wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This big-boy red combines 30% Cabernet Franc with 20% each of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, adding 15% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot for an all-five red-Bordeaux-varietal blend. Coconut flakes and vanilla-hugged oak ride sticky tannins to a quick finish, offering huge ripeness along the way."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Aromas of baking spice, dusty berry and Band-Aid introduce a rugged palate, with an intense joining of extraction, tannins and acidity. Plum, raspberry, cassis and cola flavors hold form on a ripe, generous finish this Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot blend."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Eighteen months in wood have dried out the fruit, and now the wine needs time to come together. The black plum weight is here, with a rich potential to bring out the sweet, juicy flavors."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,This Alliance Bourg wine is dry and firm with its concentrated tannins. Too much extraction has left a bitter character. It will remain a wine that is tough.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Balanced and fruity, this is a lightly structured wine. It has spice and ripe red-berry fruits in a warm strawberry character. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a juicy wine with fresh acidity and red berry flavors. It is bright with fruits although also with a dry core. The juiciness should develop, so drink from 2017. Vincent and Ludivine l'Amouller, the estate's fourth generation, began converting the vineyard to certified organic in 2010."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"93-95 Barrel sample. Very rich and dense, solid, chunky textured wine. The tannins are severe, very firm, suggesting a wine with considerable power."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A rich, concentrated Livermore Valley Bordeaux blend, comprised of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon and lesser percentages of Petit Verdot, Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. This vintage of Supremacy has a big presence, smelling of earth and cinnamon, a layering of blackberry and chocolate lingering in the background. A wine with great texture and mellowing tannins ready to drink now or in 5–7 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This juicy wine has red berry flavors and a sense of structure. Smoky with a firm tannic aftertaste, it has weight and a dark, dense aftertaste."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"From one of the properties owned by the Chanfreau family of neighboring Château Fonréaud, Chemin-Royal is dominated by new wood flavors that give the wine a toasty edge. At this stage, it is difficult to taste the fruit, but the wine has weight, which should develop through the tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is half Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon (31%), Cabernet Franc (16%), Petit Verdot (2%) and Malbec. It draws you into the glass with high-toned aromas of dried herbs, espresso, red and black fruit, along with floral notes. The palate is poised and polished, showing depth, texture and layering well beyond its weight class. It appeals on every level."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A ripe, spicy wine, with a good blend of black fruits, spice and tannins from wood aging, and a layer of dry plum skins. It has plenty of Merlot tobacco aromas and dark fruit cake flavors."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a smooth, wood-aged wine. Ripe black fruits are soft, with a contrast of toast and spice. It's juicy, with just the right amount of tannin. Although it's almost ready to drink, the wine will also age because of its structure. Drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"While not the best Keuka Spring has to offer, this Merlot-dominated Bordeaux blend offers up some pleasant fruit compote notes and a crisp finish. The tannins are a bit grainy, however and the confected fruit flavors are on the simple side. Serve with steak, hamburgers."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A tad riper, fuller and richer than the 2009 vintage, this wine is deep, subtle and complex, with a myriad of fruit and mineral flavors. Cassis, olive, fresh herb, toast, caramel and coconut are all in play, balanced and layered. The wine is young, tart and full of promise for the long term; hold at least 10–15 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Candied, tutti-frutti aromas give this a sweet, somewhat faux bouquet with little concentration. But the palate is chewy and grabby enough, with solid but modest raspberry and red plum flavors. Mellow on the finish, with a decent feel. Good but not distinguished. Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The over-exuberance of wood aging spoils this wine. With strong spice and equally tannic elements, it's all about the skeleton and not about the flesh of the fruit."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Freshly brewed coffee, green herbs, graphite and dark fruit aromas leap up from this blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc. The flavors are sweet, with a soft, lush feel."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The wine suffers from over-ripe fruit that give it a red-jelly flavor. The tannins and acidity make an odd contrast.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Vines situated close to the fortified citadel of Blaye have produced this bright and shiny 2014. With its clear red-berry fruits, black currants and acidity, it is immediately attractive. The tannins, a great support to the fruit, promise some aging. Drink now, or, better yet, wait until 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"From one of the estates owned by the Pagès family in the northern Médoc, the wine is spicy and rich with tannins and blackberry fruit. As a contrast, it is shot through with attractive acidity that is a character of the year. The wine will be ready to drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe and sweetly fruity, this is a black-currant and berry-flavored wine, with balanced juiciness and a judicious use of wood. Full-bodied, it's likely to age well over the medium term."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This classic blend of Bordeaux grape varieties maintains a classic feel throughout. It's elegant in frame, medium bodied and invigorating in acidity, yet rich with blackberry and cassis flavors. Tannins are bold and dense, but ripe, suggesting improvement with age. Hold till 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"89-91 A wine that is lighted by its acidity. It has weight, certainly, but the dominance is freshness. Extreme final smoky juiciness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a dark and probably too-tannic wine. A very dry, extracted character gives bitterness more than fruit. It's still young and has the Saint-Estèphe tannins in abundance, although its future with this dryness is uncertain."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A fruity wine from Bordeaux Vineam, this is ripe and full of red-berry fruits. It has tannins that are softening already to give an accessible wine that is rich and full. Drink from 2019."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is the second wine of Château Pibran, whose vineyard is situated close to those of the the first growths of Mouton and Lafite. Structured and dense, this is a solid, powerful wine, packed with juicy black currant fruits and generous tannins. Give this wine until 2018 before drinking."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A five-grape Bordeaux blend, with somewhat generic fruit flavors that show a mix of leaf and raisin characteristics. It's smooth and supple, drinking at its best right now, with finishing highlights of peppery herb."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Predominantly Merlot, this Bordeaux-style blend includes 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Cab Franc and 11% Malbec. Given extra bottle age prior to release, it's drinking quite nicely, with plum and black cherry fruit, a rich layer of mocha, and a firm finish with polished tannins and lemony acids."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Just over 75% Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Malbec (10%), Petit Verdot (8%) and Merlot, this wine offers brooding but well-delineated aromas and flavors of blackberry, dried flowers, black tea, herbs, earth, barrel spices and light meaty notes. It's packed tightly with firm tannins and also shows great length. Drink 2022–2028."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Firmly tannic, this wine is solid, firm and traditional in its dry structure. Black currant fruitiness shows briefly before the tannins and dark extract take over. It's a tough wine at this stage and could well remain hard. Try drinking from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Smooth and rich, a delicious black berry juice-flavored wine, its tannins embraced by ripe fruit and sweetness. The wine does have a dry core, along with acidity, although it will be ready to drink in the next 2–3 years."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Jammy, overripe fruit does not help this wine. Its soft tannins and acidity provide some pleasure, but that clumsy fruit gets in the way."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Profile has been an important, but sometimes overlooked, member of the Napa Valley pantheon for many years, and their '06 shows why. It's a rich, complex and smooth wine. Packed with blackberry, cassis and smoky, new oak flavors, it shows a firm structure of tannins and acidity. Beautiful now with a grilled steak, and should age well for at least a decade."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The second wine of La Dominique on the Saint-Emilion plateau shows the fruity side of this estate. It is packed with red fruits and with soft tannins. The acidity and the smooth texture promise early drinking for a generous wine. Drink from 2018.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"From a small estate of only 10 acres, this wine with its 60% Merlot is fruity with just the right amount of tannins. It has red fruit and crisp acidity along with a dry edge. The wine is likely to age quickly, so drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Tight and stalky, this wine has considerable acidity. Firm tannins in the background give some promise of aging. At this stage, the wine is more about structure than fruit and thus is very early in its development. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This blend of 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Malbec and 22% Petit Verdot is rich and layered on the nose with black-cherry, blueberry, dark-chocolate and roasted-beef aromas.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of Merlot (50%), Cabernet Franc (40%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (10%), this aromatic wine brings aromas of funk, earth, truffle, fire pit, dried peat, herb and cherry. The flavors are soft, silky and refined, showing a sense of grace—a very pretty expression of a Bordeaux-style blend."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Big and densely tannic, this wine's fruit is still firmly buried in the structure. It has wood, spice and ripe plum notes. With its concentrated texture, it is still capable of aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe and structured, this has black plum and ripe berry flavors that are lifted by the acidity typical of the vintage. Tannins are solid and dense, packed around the fruit, and show that the wine is still young. Drink this solid while fruity wine from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The wine has very ripe fruit that leaves a jammy character. Merlot sweetness dominates and the wine seems unbalanced maybe the result of recent bottling.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A power-packed blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot that offers mossy aromas, earth and lush black fruit scents. The palate is lively yet balanced, with saturated wild berry, toast, anise and pepper flavors. Dark, toasted and showing licorice on the finish. A little hot and aggressive, so drink in late 2010 through 2012."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a ripe concentrated wine with attractive smoky tannins as well as fresh acidity. It is perfumed with black-currant fruits that are laced with the dry structure as well as acidity. With a year or two more in bottle, this will be a finely balanced wine. Drink from 2019."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The wine from this estate, controlled by Jean-Luc Thunevin of Château Valandraud, is serious with dark tannins and concentrated fruit. It is complex with layers of black fruit and a sweet ripe structure. Serious, intense and with fine acidity as a balance, it will be ready from 2023."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Quady's Right Bank blend is three-quarters Cabernet Franc and one-quarter Merlot. Smoky and showing a lightly funky scent when opened, it develops into a leathery and tannic red wine, checkered with red and black fruits, hints of tobacco and a vein of graphite."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A juicy wine, it has soft tannins and gently stalky fruit textures. Black currant fruits accompany fresh, tangy acidity. Not for aging, so drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Rich and juicy, this has attractive red berry fruits that are already developing well. Structurally, it is foursquare in character with a rough edge. It's for the medium term"
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Good but a step down from recent vintages. Big and brawny on the nose, with oak-based aromas of shoe polish, chocolate mint chips and mocha. The thick palate is deep, raisiny and chunky, with roasted black fruit flavors touched up by chocolate. Very good and likable, but not as thorough and alluring as it has been. 40% Malbec with 30% each Cabernet and Merlot."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a bold, ripe and spicy wine. With firm tannins contrasting with the rich perfumed Cabernet Franc fruits, this is a wine with good potential. The dry edge will soften as the wine matures and create a dense concentration. Drink this wine from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This blend is comprised of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, but unusually, led by Petit Verdot. The wine is inky dark and tannic with extracted blackberry flavors. High alcohol gives it a burn from the midpalate through the finish."

Cocoa nibs, coffee, black cherry, dill, bay leaf and black olive pop on the palate, where the lingering acidity ensures aging potential."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This red blend has characteristics of late-harvested grapes from a cool year. Aromas of prune and blueberry are cool and mellow but not lifted. The palate is smooth, with blackberry, baked plum and chocolate flavors. A mild, slightly pasty tasting finish is rich but hollows out quickly. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"One of the second wines of Château Ramage la Batisse, this is the better of the two. It shows ripe and juicy black fruits that push through the dense structure to promise a rich future. It's worth aging this wine for 3–5 years and more."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The wine is balanced: it is firm with tannins and rich with berry fruits. It has a fine structure that will stand it in good stead as it matures. Drink from 2019.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is a blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Malbec and 8% Petit Verdot from Seven Hills, Loess, Mill Creek Upland and Serra Pedace vineyards. Aromas of fresh herbs, scorched earth, mineral, and red and black fruit—slightly dried-out-seeming—lead to a silky textured concentrated palate. The tannins are there but are beautifully integrated. It shows plenty of hang time on the finish. It should have a good 15 years in front of it. Best from 2024–2030."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Fresh wild berry and Concord grape aromas meet with dark lavender, black tea and crushed slate on the nose of this blend of 51% Merlot, 26% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 5% Malbec and 4% Petit Verdot. Boysenberry syrup meets with pencil shavings on the palate."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Smooth and unctuous in texture, this has dense black fruits that edge toward dryness from the tannins. Dark chocolate and licorice notes lend a bitter edge. Rich and modern in style, this should age over the next 5–6 years."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A fresh wine with juicy red fruits, but weighed down by harsh tannins. The mouthfeel is dry, just bitter. It's only in the finish that good fruit acidity shows through."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90-92 Barrel sample. As often, Magdelaine is a wine that is on the austere side, emphasizing minerality, not showing much at this stage. The acidity is tight, opening slowly to blackcurrant flavors."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Portfolio is a full-on, five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend—half Merlot. Dark, dense and textural, it's loaded with blackberry and black cherry fruit, swathed in baking spices, cinnamon and mocha. The tannins are beautifully managed, and it should drink magnificently through the mid-2020s."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This excellent blend of 70% Cabernet Franc, 25% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon shows caramelized black cherry, mint chocolate chip and a bit of smoke on the dense nose. The palate's soft mouthfeel is held up by firm tannins that last deep into the finish, presenting rich cherry juice flavors, along with caramel, milk chocolate and pleasant oak character."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The estate Napanook is made to be soft in tannin and fresh in fruit. It succeeds in this vintage on both accounts, blending 92% Cabernet Sauvignon with 5% Petit Verdot and 3% Cabernet Franc, allowing the wine to age in 20% new barrels. Clove, currant, black tea and chocolate-covered raspberry lie luxuriously on the palate, finishing in velvety violet. Drink now through 2023."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"While smoke and char notes are prominent on the nose, there's plenty of concentrated blackberry and cherry flavor in this medium-bodied red. It's fleshy and rich on the palate, but balanced out nicely by zesty strikes of cranberry acidity and fine, feathery tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This second wine of Château Potensac is soft, fruity with a hint of firmer structure. Juicy Cabernet gives the wine its shape and freshness. It is already drinkable, fruity and fresh."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Red-jelly fruit flavors suggest the fruit for this wine was superripe. That gives an unbalanced character between the tannins and the fruit. Acidity at the end is a more hopeful sign.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Big tannins dominate this still young wine. It has spice and a dry toast character that will need to soften. With acidity and hints of red fruits that should happen, so drink this wine from 2019 when its potential should be realized."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90-92 Barrel sample. Big, ripe fruits, spiced with new wood, a big-hearted blackberry wine, sweet tannins, potentially generous."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This five-grape Bordeaux blend offers sharp-edged fruit flavors of berry and cassis. Acids are firm, and the tannins have a biting, slightly green, slightly bitter edge. Perhaps more time is the key."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Fragrant and perfumed, this wine is the epitome of great Cabernet Sauvignon. It is fruity, juicy yet with serious concentrated tannins. There is spice from the wood aging along with a dash of pepper, all the while just bringing out the beautiful black-currant flavors. Drink this wine from 2024"

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"92–94. Barrel sample. Tight, firm and mineral in style, this wine is dark with expressive tannins cast over black fruits. As always, the wine is a complex expression of its fine terroir."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Supple, dark, and laced with licorice, cassis, and clove, this well-crafted Bordeaux blend does not scream high alcohol, though it tops 14.6%. What keeps it focused and precise are the vivid acids and sculpted tannins. It's the work of a young winemaker who is improving dramatically with each new vintage, even as his vineyard puts out better and better fruit."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90-92 Barrel sample. Packed with ripe fruits, caramel flavors, lots of wood, solid and well balanced. Good final acidity."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Light in aromatic intensity, this has subtle notes of cherry skin and blue fruit. The palate showcases a ton of structure, but the flavors seem mute in comparison, and the finish feels brittle."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A ripe year like 2009 is kind to the Cabernet Sauvignon of Château Figeac. The wine is perfumed with new wood and sweet fruits, delicious black currant flavors giving both ripeness and freshness. The wine has weight and impressive density. A star of the vintage."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The ample fruitiness of this 80% Merlot wine is right up front. It comes from a large 116-acre estate on the extension of the Pomerol plateau. Firm tannins as well as generous black plum and berry fruits are well balanced, just needing time to soften and fill out. Drink this full, rich wine from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The 2006 Chertsey is a blend of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 100% French oak. The oak's vanilla and cedar notes provide a foundation for the wine's cassis and plum flavors, cosseting them in soft tannins. Drink now–2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"93–95. Barrel sample. Full bodied and ripe, this wine is marked by smoky character, spiciness and full-throttle tannins. Blackberry fruits on the palate complement this serious structure. Obviously a long-term wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,A balance of blueberry-chiffon ripeness and asphalt tightness is enhanced by spearmint and cola notes on the nose of this blend from eastern Santa Ynez Valley. The palate shows generous black fruit against a restrained tannic frame of tobacco and cedar.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The high percentage of Cabernet Franc makes itself known in this wine with tobacco leaf and tomato skin aromas on the nose. The palate is dense, with black cherry and plum flavors. The gripping tannins turn a bit astringent on the finish. Try with steak or hamburgers."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A solid wine with firm tannins, this has structure as well as black-currant acidity. It still has a dry core although this will certainly soften over the next few months. It has the potential to be a ripe fruity wine from early 2018."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Firm in tannins, this Bordeaux blend was grown in the cooler Oak Knoll District of the valley. Along with the astringency, it shows very ripe, sweetly jammy flavors of black cherries, currants and licorice. Could improve with cellaring."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A firm and tannic wine, it is still developing. The dry structure and the smoky wood aging are dominant, giving a hard feel. It does have a juicy hint underneath, so the fruit will develop although tannins are going to remain prominent."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This structured, young wine has good acidity along with black currant fruitiness and firm tannins that need time to soften. The aftertaste, with its lift of freshness is already attractive. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The dusty tannins dominate this firm and dry wine. With its new wood aging and its concentration, it is complex and dense. The ripe black fruit offers power and sweetness. The wine is likely to age well over five years or more."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Generally regarded as one of the lighter vintages of the 21st century, the wine still has charm and attractive mature flavors like mushroom, as well as a leathery texture. The end still hints at freshness and attractive fruit."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a big and complex wine by Napa-turned-Paso winemaker David Galzignato. Dense aromas suggest ripe plums, black licorice, vanilla and mint. Flavors are juicy with purple fruits and grounded with herbs and mint, all hanging on an excellent tannic structure that's substantial but not pushy."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Lovingston's medium-bodied Bordeaux Blend is pleasantly grapy on the nose with an undertone of darkly toasted oak, nuts and savory spices. The palate holds a decent amount of black fruit, but with a green, underripe vein and fairly high level of acidity and tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec offers classic peppercorn and big juicy cassis and blackberry notes. It's enjoyable now in its vibrant fruit forwardness but also structured enough to let sit 2018–2020. On the finish are touches of bittersweet chocolate and dried herb."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of Cabernet Franc (35%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (18%) with the rest equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot, this wine offers brooding notes of herbs, black currant, mineral and flowers. The lighter color belies its rich structure of firm tannins and tart, lively acids that merit time in the cellar to be fully appreciated. Best after 2018 but will be well worth the wait."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"In a blind tasting, it's hard to imagine many people would identify this wine as from Washington, due to the coolness of the vintage and the style. It's almost impenetrable when first opened, with brooding notes of graphite, exotic spice, herbs, toast and dark fruit. The acids are mouthwatering, the tannins firm and tightly wound, and they need significant time to uncoil. But when they do, the wine glorious. Give it at least until 2019 in the cellar or a 24+ hour decant. One of the highlights of the vintage."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"89—91 Barrel sample. A dark, chocolatey wine, with coffee and mocha elements. It's very powerful, the fruit is juicy, generous."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A light and fruity wine that has bright black fruits and an edge of tannins. The black currant and acidity give the wine its fruity character, typical of the vintage. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Merlot makes up nearly two-thirds of this blend with the balance Cabernet Franc. Brooding dried herb, cocoa and dark fruit aromas lead to rich but well-balanced black-fruit flavors backed by a firm core of tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Here is a huge ripe and luxurious wine, with great power. The texture is solid, filled with firm tannins, the flavors are black and ripe. Along with the power, though, is much of the elegance and poise that characterizes great Saint-Julien."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Bordeaux-style blend enters with a sharp, tannic, rough-hewn mouthfeel. The fruit may be ripe enough, but the hot finish makes it difficult to taste."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A wine that has freshness, some wood and a soft series of tannins, almost velvet. There is a stalky juiciness here, to complete a wine that offers the freshest acidity, with only hints of darker fruits."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"91–93. Barrel sample. Owner Alain Moueix is a standard bearer for biodynamics in Bordeaux. This is a rich and opulent wine, boasting ripe black currants and fragrant fruits. A very pure and forward wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Led by Vincent Lacoste (the sixth generation), this is a rich wine, with smooth tannins and plenty of spice. The wood-aging flavors are already integrated into the generous black fruits and concentrated structure. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This powerful, perfumed wine shows as much structure as fruit. That gives it a strong presence, solid and dense. Its black plum and damson fruits have richness, spice and intense acidity. With the dark tannins, the wine will certainly age. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A smooth, polished wine, with acidity, sweet fruit and a range of dusty tannins, with acidity. This is an accomplished, delicious wine that is developing fast, and seems only for medium-term aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is rich, structured and full-bodied. It bursts with superripe Merlot, darkly tannic and dense. Rich berry and black plum fruits add their weight to this concentrated wine. Drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This full and structured wine offers good acidity, firm tannins and layers of black-currant flavors. It has good potential with richness, weight and balance. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up over 70% of this blend with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It shows aromas of dark cherries, licorice and brooding black fruit that at times seems slightly dried out. The palate shows elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of 45% Malbec, 34% Merlot and 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, there are some upfront notes of game, leather and cured meat that add interest to the black plum and cherry core. The palate is plush and broad, but not flat, with soft, approachable tannins and pleasant dark berry and plum flavors that are lifted by ample acidity. Drink now–2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The earlier tannins in this wine have softened considerably. Now it is dominated by ripe fruit. The wine is soft and jammy with attractive black currants and a layer of firm tannins underneath. Drink from 2022.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Claret is the old British term for the wines of Bordeaux. This wine, the first such from Francis Ford Coppola's Sonoma County winery, is a good buy. It's a bit rustic, but offers smooth flavors of blackberries, currants and chocolate."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe and spicy, this is an attractive package of warm tannins and red berries. This wine has a solid, dry core, but it will develop fast—delicious within a year."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Tight, textured and mineral, this wine just hints at the fruit to come. It is dark, brooding and concentrated, with black-plum flavors just beginning to shine through the dry texture. It needs aging, so drink from 2022."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bernard Larrat's wine is dry at this stage, although with hints of ripe black-currant fruit and acidity. The potential is there with juicy flavors and fruitiness already developing well. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is an excellent, Bordeaux-style blend, almost three quarters Cabernet Sauvignon. It's concentrated and shows pinpoint focus, with pure, dark fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis. The lingering finish sparkles with cinnamon highlights."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"From one of the two properties owned by the Mulliez family of Château Belle-Vue, this wine is full of dense tannins as well as black currants. It is likely to develop into a rich although always firm wine. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"93-95 Barrel sample. Big, spicy wood, packed with dense, wood and fruit tannins. But the wood is over a base of broad fruit, sweet blackberries and ripeness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Produced from the best selection of vines at Bélingard, aged for 18 months in wood. This 2005 certainly tastes of wood aging, high toast flavors dominating. It needs time for the black plum and spice flavors to show through this almost astringent wood."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A fresh and fruity wine, with black currant notes, yet somewhat stalky in character. The aftertaste is bright and light."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A mild concentration of cherry, green herb, spice and rose petals mark the nose. Softly grained tannins offer just enough grip to this medium-bodied wine, with high-toned cherry and cranberry leading the flavors."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a bright, ripe wine. It has a sense of lightness, attractive acidity and black currant flavors. This delicious, juicy wine will be ready to drink in another few months."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Warm, loamy, oaky aromas of pastry and blackberry set up a tannic, jammy, cheek-pounding mouthfeel. This is 75% Malbec and the rest Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's dark and chocolaty, with blackberry, prune and coffee flavors. A heaping of chocolate and fig makes the finish quite friendly; drink through 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This vintage of Fusion V is already approachable and enjoyable, with ripe aromas and flavors of brambly berry and cherry that are accented by attractive notes of cocoa powder, cigar tobacco, sweet spice and leather. The fine tannins are grippy and structured, complementing the black pepper, toast and licorice elements that linger on the finish. A blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Malbec, 15% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot, drink now–2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Bordeaux-style blend, which includes all five classic Bordeaux varieties, opens with herbal aromas of forest berry, black-currant leaf and tobacco, all grounded in ripe, fruity tones of blackberry and cassis. The palate is concentrated and dense, with a full yet firm texture and flavors of black-plum skin, cherry, leather, bittersweet chocolate and anise that carry  through to the long finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Hailing from one of the state's most esteemed vineyard sites, this wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon and just over a quarter Merlot, with the balance Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. The oak (40% new French) is dialed back, allowing rich, layered notes of plum, herbs, licorice, toast and coffee to rise with a firm scaffolding of slightly dry tannins supporting them. Still young, it will be best after 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Mint aromas speak of the wood used in aging this wine. With some burnt tannin character, it's perhaps not a wine that will show great fruit."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"One of the finest wines to come from Cantenac Brown for many years, this is powerful and dense, dominated by Cabernet Franc tannins and fruits. The structure has a smooth, polished character that locates it firmly in Margaux, giving elegance and discreet fruitiness. Age this fine wine for many years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Obviously wood-aged, with a smoky toast flavor, this is a wine that shows the power of Saint-Estèphe tannins in full force. At the same time, there is a blackberry character that adds richness and juiciness, which cuts through the dry core. Age for at least 7–8 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Dense black currants, plum, beef jerky, dark chocolate and licorice show on the rich nose of this Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot blend. Flavors of dried blueberry, toasted sage leaves, thick vanilla and hints of clove swirl into a luxurious sip."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Firm, dry tannins behind this wine give a hard edge that will need time. The wine is powered by its structure, solid and only just fruity. Wait until at least 2017 to allow more fruitiness to come through, although the wine will likely always be tough."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Big tannins give this wine a powerful structure. It has a dense texture that is slowly revealing the sweet-tasting fruit. Powerful and concentrated, it has a long future."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Merlot (73%) takes the lead on this wine, which is rounded out by Malbec (12%), Cabernet Sauvignon (7%), Petit Verdot (4%) and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of herb, barrel spice, pencil lead and red and black fruit are followed by plump yet elegant fruit flavors backed by chalky tannins. It shows a lot of restraint."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Deep red-violet in color, this features a bouquet of cherry, Delicious apple and juniper. It is bright on entry, with flavors of black cherry and red plum that are overtaken by notes of clove and tar with a touch of iodine. Smooth tannins persist into a bright lingering finish with a hint of smoke."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A fine, slightly mineral wine, packed with tight tannins, but also with the rich fruits of the vintage. It is well balanced, the acidity sitting easily with the sweet, jammy fruit flavors. Dryness and some austerity mark this wine as a fine partner for food."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"While the wine has some concentration from the old vines, its general effect is of a soft, open and generous texture that is full and rounded. There is some spice, a touch of toast and full-bodied blackberry and currant flavors. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Lifted cherry and floral aromatics carry with them a hint of barrel char in this medium-bodied, elegantly styled blend of 51% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Petit Verdot, 11% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec. It's admirably supple and harmonious from start to finish. Drink now–2015."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Bordeaux-style wine is ripe and rich, balance between dusty tannins and stalky red fruits. Acidity and an attractive generous texture give it shape. It is ready to drink."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Offering some of the few relatively good-value wines from Pauillac, this 50-acre property has made an impressive wine in this tough year. It is structured and dense although the black-currant fruitiness shows that it will develop quickly to be drinkable from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Based in the heart of the Haut-Médoc, this property has produced a wine that shows a dry character, with bitter extraction and too much wood. There are just hints of juicy fruit that will need time to come through. It could well stay dry and firm always."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend has high ambitions, to judge by the richness. It is absolutely massive in blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and caramelized oak. It's far too strong to enjoy now, lacking any sense of proportion, but it does seem like a good cellar candidate. Give it until 2017 and see if it begins to calm down."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe and fruity, this is a wine that will develop quickly. With black currant and red-berry fruits it is perfumed, crisp as well as allowing plenty of room for juicy acidity. The tannins are firm and well balanced. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This five-grape Bordeaux-style blend is 54% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Cab Franc, 8% Malbec and 4% Petit Verdot. Sleek, subtle and sporting an overall elegance, it's a sophisticated take on a Right Bank Bordeaux style, with black olive and cassis, espresso and dark chocolate in perfect proportion."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"91–93. Barrel sample. Rich, smooth mint and polished tannins give this wine a ripe, opulent feel. It benefits from the fine Cabernet of Pauillac, which adds structure and juicy black currant acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87–89. Barrel sample. This wine is solid and dark with bitter tannins that offer a hard edge to the riper blackberry fruits. A dense wine that has a very dry core.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec make up the bulk of this blend, which is thick with dusty mocha and blackberry jam flavors. Medium bodied, it shows its crisp acidity on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This very limited reserve mixes old-vine fruit from the Bacchus and Weinbau vineyards (all under the Sagemoor umbrella). Berries, cherries and cassis draw you into a dusty, detailed wine with nuances of herb and earth. A lick of rich dark chocolate ends it with a flourish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"88–90. Barrel sample. Juicy and fruity, this wine has brisk acidity and fresh fruit flavors, along with a bitter edge of dark chocolate."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Cabernet Franc (54%) takes the lead on this blend, with the balance Merlot (29%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. The aromas of flower, barrel spice and herb are light, with slightly dried-out raspberry and cherry notes lurking in the background. It also has a medicinal top note. Flavors are super-smooth and palate-coating, finishing sweet."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A ripe, smooth and fruity wine that is already delicious in its ripe berry and plum flavors. Touches of new wood show how it is still developing, a burst of vanilla followed by fruity acidity. It will be a full, ripe wine, but give it until 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The 2004 gives some easy aromas of milk chocolate, mint, herbs, olives and eucalyptus. As it opens, the tannins get stickier and the flavors of chocolate, plum, cassis and tobacco expand. On the finish, look for vanilla and good herbal length."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"With its high proportion of Cabernet Franc (45%), this is a finely perfumed rich wine. It has great tannins, a smoky character that comes from the wood. The tannins are quite marked, giving a tight firm edge to the wine that otherwise has generous fruitiness. This is a complex wine, impressive, and likely to age over many years. Drink from 2028."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90-92. Barrel sample. Big and serious, with a well-balanced wood and spice character. The tense tannins provide a nervy, tight counterpoint."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"With good density, this is a success for the vintage. It has ripe, smooth fruit, flavors of black berry, the tannins well integrated. Age for a year."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Spicy, rich and full of ripe fruit, this wine has great potential. It is structured and dense while bringing out a stylish elegance. Blackberry fruit dominates the tannins to create a wine that has both concentration and fine fruit. Drink from 2022."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Smoky, dense and solid, this is a structured wine that brings together plenty of ripe, juicy fruit and rich tannins. There is some tightness and minerality, but the generous nature of the wine is dominant. The finish just floats away into fresh black currants."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This structured wine also has attractive layers of ripe fruits. Black-currant freshness balances with a dry tannic core and a rich juicy texture. It's going to be ready to drink soon, so only wait until 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The wine is soft and ripe. Generous blackberry fruits and a smooth texture from wood aging give this wine its richness and open character. Hints of vanilla and spice add to the perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2019.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"89-91 A firm wine, with tight tannins, very structured, showing a mineral edge."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Toast aromas precede layers of wood flavors that give the wine a tough, dry, spicy character that masks the fruit."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Strong's Symmetry almost qualifies as a Cabernet Sauvignon, with 71% of that variety, and the rest consisting of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. The Meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a Bordeaux-style wine. Easily the best Symmetry ever, it is a great wine. Dry and somewhat astringent in tannins, it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants, with an array of sweet herbs, chocolate and tobacco. It's delicious now, and should slowly develop bottle complexities over the next 10 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A layered and complex wine, the 2009 Fusion V is one remarkable selection that's delicious now, although it certainly shows the stuffing to age well for another three to five years, at least. Forward sweet-oak notes marry harmoniously with black-fruit aromas on the nose. The robust, dense palate offers ripe flavors of cassis, blackberry and plum, with accents of leather, tobacco and licorice that linger long into the finish. Chewy, gripping tannins provide a firm structure, framing the full fruit flavors."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A taut but expressive nose of minerals, pepper and red fruit lead this lovely wine from Stellensbosch. The velvety, mouthfilling flavors of slightly sweet berry and spice are luxuriant, and the finish is long. Soft and refined but memorable. A beautiful wine with ageable appeal."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Elderberry, white pepper, leather, asphalt and black olive show on the nose of this blend of all five Bordeaux varieties done in the region's savory style. The flavors are mellow overall, with wildfire smoke and a bit of herbaceousness decorating the elderberry and graphite core."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Crisp and fruity, this is a wine full of red currant and blackberry flavors. It does have a tannic structure that will allow the wine to develop along with the acidity. In the family for three-generations, the estate is now run by Denis Hazane. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The second wine from this estate with its moated medieval castle is finely structured while showing all the delicious fruit of this vintage. It has spice, some firm tannins and juicy black-currant fruitiness. It will develop well and relatively quickly. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Blackberry and cherry notes are fresh and primary in this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend, but shaded with interesting notes of coffee and smoke. The palate is juicy and supple with soft, furry tannins that accentuate a velvety mouthfeel. It's a boldly structured wine, but elegantly framed and long on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Sourced entirely from the Champoux Vineyard, this Bordeaux-style blend is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon. Yummy from the first sniff to the last sip, it's packed with juicy berries and cassis, gracefully wrapped in layers of black olive, toast, clean earth and dark chocolate. Tannins are ripe and smooth."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"For a Listrac, this is soft and open, a generous wine that has weight while showing ripe Merlot character. Full black plum skin flavors go with spice, licorice and touches of wood. It's ready to drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The wine is tight and perhaps firm. Its extracted tannins and dry core are too much for the fruit.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is heavily spiced from its wood aging. Fresher fruit flavors do come through to give black currants, bright acidity as well as firmer fruit structure. The wine still needs time, so drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Firmly tannic and concentrated, this wine demonstrates how this property has developed impressively in recent years. It is certainly powerful, although managing to retain the Saint-Julien elegance. The blackberry fruits will develop well as it matures. Drink from 2024."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Chosen from a selection of parcels, this dense and complex wine has layers of firm tannins that a give a dry, tough core. Underneath, the juicy, currant and berry fruits need to spring to life. Give this concentrated wine until 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A beautiful, velvet-textured wine, with its dense fruit, enticing and attractive. But the wine, from the 5-acre parcel owned by actor Gérard Depardieu, is balanced, with a good layer of dry tannins, fresh acidity and subtle hints of the new wood used in the aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The wine has plenty of black-currant fruit. At the moment, the fruit is developing while still dominated by lean dry tannins. The two will balance out, giving a structured wine that will need to age. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Classic Bordeaux in structure, this firm wine has dry tannins that still dominate the black and red berry fruits. However, the fruit that's now in the background will come strongly forward to give a fresh character and plenty of final black currant."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"From one of the few estates in Saint-Julien that is not a classified growth, this wine represents a bargain. The wine is rich, perfumed and beautifully structured. It has a velvety consistency with its ripe black currants and generous tannins. The estate is named after the mill belonging to Abbot Bridane in the Middle Ages. Drink from 2022."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The rich fruit and structure of this impressive wine are already well integrated. With power and concentration as well as layers of dark fruits, it is showing fine aging potential. The wine, dominated by 80% Merlot, comes from vines in the east of Saint-Emilion. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"As is often the case with Phélan Ségur, there is an excess of wood in this wine. Sometimes it works, as here, because the big, bold fruits are powerful enough to match the toastiness. That suggests a future as a ripe, black-fruited and structured wine with room for juicy acidity. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is Barlow's Bordeaux blend. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's a beautiful wine, dry and balanced and fully ready to drink now, although it will take some years of cellaring. With fine acidity and tannins, it displays elegant flavors of currants and cassis, with rich edges of mocha and cedar."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pure fruitiness, this wine is full of black currant flavors and a stalky, dusty texture. Without wood aging, it has acidity, fruitiness and some dry tannins. Drink from the end of 2015."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"One of the top Margaux wines, this is in top form, finely balanced and as elegant as it is powerful. It is darkly structured, dense yet balancing tannins with ripe black plums. It expresses the complexity of the vintage. A wine for serious, long-term aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine appears to mark a departure from Trottevieille's normally strict style, showing more opulence, new wood and ripeness. There is still a touch of austerity initially, but from that point, the wine opens out with a great burst of fresh blackberry jelly and stylish texture."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of 89% Cabernet Sauvignon and 11% Merlot, this wine has subtle baking spice and a velvety texture of soft, red fruit. With the barest minimum of grip on the back palate, it's ready to drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Bordeaux-style blend is mostly Merlot. Fragrant and spicy, it intrigues with a sensuous mix of brown spices, cumin, citrus and toast. Soft and open, it moves into the lush middle with blackberry and black cherry fruit, more spices and citrus, all nicely melded."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"All dry tannin and bramble aromas, this wine is a tough proposition. François Maurin and son Raphael handle the organic vineyards and wine fermented in stainless steel."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time to develop, although it will give the wine density and ripe berries in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"85-87 A dark wine, the fruit tasting a little over-ripe. It does have structure and acidity, but feels soft and flabby."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Betz Family's Merlot-based blend offers sleek plum and cassis fruit, with a tart, sappy, yet penetrating presence. Despite some years in bottle, the acids seem to out-run the fruit, though that may bode well for cellaring."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A big, bold, fruity wine, this has great tannins, ripe black-currant fruit and an attractive sense of structure. It has all the juiciness and freshness of 2010, but is a wine for aging over 3–4 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe and soft, this is a smooth, dense wine. Yes, it has plenty of tannins, but they're smothered by the concentrated black fruit that gives it its generous, rich character. It's likely to age well, so drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Situated two miles north of the castle of Blaye, this estate's vintage delivered tannins as well as fruit here, with acidity and blackberry fruit. It is a structured wine, still young with its bright fruits and crisp character. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Soft, light fruit, packed with red cherries and fresh berries, is the star. The tannins are a mere hint, so the wine should be enjoyed soon for its attractive juiciness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc, 8% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot. Aromas of herbs, coffee, barrel spice and cherry are followed by tightly wound tannins and fruit flavors. Give it time to open up."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A finely structured wine, well spiced with ripe berry fruits and intense but balanced acidity. This is stylish, attractive and is worth aging for 3-4 years."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"90–92. Barrel sample. Powerful and fruity, this finely situated chateau on the edge of the slopes of Saint-Émilion has produced a brightly fruity wine typical of the year. It's a wine that's ripe with berries, soft tannins and great juiciness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The wine is dry and firm with a serious amount of new wood and spice. That seems to have swamped the fruit at this stage. There is enough fruit weight there to develop as the wine matures. Drink from 2022.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Aromas of sundry spices and tomato paste, forest floor and cigar box carry onto the medium-bodied palate, which bears a slack, pliant core. Fine tannins give the finish traction."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a fruity wine, and its black currant flavor emerging right away. Next comes the bright acidity, while the tannins form a solid, dark and dry contrast. The wine needs at least two years to soften into something rich."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This small 10-acre property has produced an attractively fruity wine with soft tannins and juicy black-fruit flavors. It is lightly structured—displaying more fruit than tannin—and has a fresh, bright aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Generously filling and satisfying, this Bordeaux-styled blend is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. It's medium in oak and tannin, with a toasty character underlying red cherry, currant and cassis, the ending marked by cedar and clove."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Cabernet Sauvignon (50%) and Merlot (38%) make up the majority of this wine with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. A blend of McClellan, Seven Hills and Anna Marie vineyards, it brings generous aromas of fresh herbs and cherry, with light barrel accents. The palate is soft and supple, showing a very pretty, elegant styling."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"84-86 Tough, only with tannins. Very hard wine, firm."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The winery pulled out all the stops on this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, yet the wine is so tannic and sharp now. Shows massively extracted black currant and oak flavors that run deep and long in the finish. Who knows what this wine might do in 10–15 years, but it's a roll of the dice."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Tight tannins mask the ripe fruit in a wine that is set for long-term aging, so there is a dry core that dominates at the moment. But not for long: the bold black fruits are insistent and are going to be delicious. This is a structured wine that will be ready in 2026."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Bordeaux-style red is blended from the Seven Hills, Klipsun, Canoe Ridge and Wallula vineyards. It shows a lovely structure, which takes its ripe blueberry, black cherry and cassis fruit and complements it with lush barrel flavors of coffee and dark chocolate. Fine-grained, dusty tannins smooth it along through an elegant, mouth-coating finish."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Brambly boysenberry, blackberry liqueur and crème de cassis lead the nose and mouth of this attractive wine, with waves of cigar-box spice, mentholated herbs and leather adding intrigue. It's firmly structured and packed with black-fruit flavors, resulting in a crushed-velvet texture. The finish is long and evolving, and this should continue to develop well through 2022."

It has tremendous flavor appeal, featuring a lush mix of red and black fruit—both berry and plum—with generous barrel flavors of mocha and espresso. It gains mass and breadth as it breathes."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The wine has bold fruit and ripe tannins. There is still a strong flavor from the wood aging although this should integrate. The fruit is the dominant character of this red-berry flavored wine. Drink from 2021.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The small area of Pez is one of the top sites in Saint-Estèphe, with many highly rated chateaus. This is one.

As usual, this will develop more quickly than its more powerful stablemate, Léoville-Barton."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is a blend of Merlot (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (35%) and Cabernet Franc. Brooding aromas of blackberry, black currant, herb and spice lead to rich ripe hedonistic black-fruit flavors that bring a compelling sense of texture. It's not shy, but for those looking for a big bold ripe wine, this one's for you."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The second wine of Château Kirwan, this has something of the same stylishness as the top wine. It certainly has structure and layers of red fruits along with acidity. Produced from young vines, it is up-front with its juicy fruitiness and fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2017."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"91-93. Barrel sample. This wine has firm, solid tannins, but enough rich dark fruit to sustain all of the dryness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a lean wine that feels to have only structure and very little fruit. There are dry, dense tannins and a firm texture that will only soften marginally."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"It's fair to call this a junior version of Lancaster's more expensive, superb Bordeaux-style wines. Like them, it's rich in black currant and cedar flavors, and quite tannic, a wine that needs a few years to come around. It's also a touch more rustic. Three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, one quarter Merlot."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This classic Bordeaux-style blend—made with 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot—is a stunner now, and it shows the potential to age for another 5–10 years. Black cherry, cassis and wild blackberry notes dominate the nose and mouth, but supporting accents of forest and cigar box spice add depth and interest to the fruit core.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This blend of 59% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Cabernet Franc and 18% Merlot offers complex, alluring aromas of dried herbs, flowers, dry chocolate and black currant along with a prominent mineral streak. The fruit flavors are elegant and supple in feel. A pleasing interplay between the structured tannins and acid creates a sense of tension through the lingering finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"As with other wines produced by the Dulon family, this suffers from too much oak. Here it shows in the wood acidity, the burnt character and the bitter coffee flavors. It's a shame because somewhere under there is fruit. A year or two more will help, so wait until 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"While the wood is still very apparent in this wine, it does also have the rich fruit as a balance. The acidity, dark berry fruits and a fine juicy character go with the firm tannins and spicy wood character. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Low yields and a high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon have produced an impressive, dense and structured wine. With a smoky backdrop from the wood aging, it has rich black-plum fruit and a serious concentration. It is going to age well, and will be ready to drink only from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Lovely aromatics push scents of espresso, cassis, truffle and baker's chocolate right up front. The wine is polished, fine-boned and balanced, with taut cranberry and raspberry fruit. It brings in subtle accents of chalk, earth, rock and lead pencil, building to a firm, beautifully structured finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Red-berry fruits and a core of tannins make up a wine that has structure and the potential of some fine fruits. It is juicy with plenty of acidity at the end to give the wine a lift.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is Duckhorn's second label for their Napa Bordeaux reds, and with this '06 vintage, it's on the thin, herbal side, with only modest cherry-berry flavors. Dry and very tannic, it's not an ager."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The wine is all juicy red-currant and berry fruits. With light tannins and a crisp edge the wine is fruity and ready to drink.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a dark, dense and brooding Bordeaux-style blend, comprised of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot, 5% Malbec and 5% Cabernet Franc. Notes of cocoa, cigar tobacco and leather jazz up the black-fruit core of cassis, black plum and berry. The palate is full and gripping, with firm tannins that hang on tightly through the long and slightly smoky finish. Drink after decanting now, or enjoy through 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"88—90 Barrel sample. A light, fresh wine, with some good blackcurrant flavors. This offers clean, ripe fruit, soft tannins. The hint of dryness to finish is a bonus, suggesting some ageability."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a perfumed wine full of attractive black currant and spice flavors. The wood aging has given a great fillip of richness to the stalky fruit as well as rounding it out. It could age further, so drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The acidity that is a characteristic of the vintage shows through in this wine. It clashes with the tannins to give a strangely unbalanced wine.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Full of jammy Merlot fruits, this is a smooth ripe wine. Dried fruits and tannins give the wine its varietal character. They are freshened by the acidity and black-currant fruitiness. The aftertaste allows the firm tannins to shine. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This grand wine is stylish and elegant. It is also powerful and dense with dark tannins and great concentration. It is a very fine wine, packed with black plum and berry fruits and balanced richness. Don't let the great fruit deceive: this is a wine for the serious long term. Drink from 2028."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Palisade is Merlot-based in 2010, with 11% Cabernet Sauvignon filling out the blend. Muscular and complex, this is Merlot at a level rarely found at this price. Cherry, cassis, earth, graphite and mineral flavors mingle seamlessly. Sourced from a brilliant mix of vineyards including Champoux, Ciel du Cheval, DuBrul and Klipsun."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The rich, spicy and savory nose evoke the food for which the country is known, and this wine would undoubtedly pair well with full-bodied, spiced meats and stews. Its full, spicy nose leads into dependable flavors of red berry, wooded spice and pepper, with a slightly bitter, smoked edge. Not a terribly complex wine, but solid and tasty nonetheless."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"All about freshness, this wine has crisp red-currant flavors and bright acidity. The tannins are just a background to the juicy, fruity front. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Made from a majority of Merlot rounded out by other red Bordeaux varieties, this wine leans savory, featuring mushroom and leather within a suggestion of Martini olive water. The fruit is more shy, revealing black currant at best, with a flat, ghost-like finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A lean, fresh style of Bordeaux, with red fruits balancing on dry tannins and a top layer of acidity. It is almost austere, but it's rescued by the freshness of the fruit and underlying structure."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Produced from young vines at Château Siaurac, the wine, dominated by 90% Merlot, is generous, approachable and ripe. It was matured in tank rather than wood, allowing the black fruits to come through strongly. The aftertaste brings out fruitiness as much as the gentle tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The wine has fine potential. While the wood flavors are dominant, as it develops the ripe red-berry flavors that are there will fill out and bring their fruity acidity along. It is going to be ready to drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Fruity and dark, this Bordeaux-style blend is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one third a mix of the four other grapes. The result is a wine with stiff tannins and excellent structure, with clean dark-fruit and forest-floor flavors alongside streaks of iron and caramel."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"All six Bordeaux grapes—yes, including Carmenère—are in this fruity blend, aged for 21 months in 80% new French oak and 20% once-used French oak. Plums and cherries, a distinctive whiff of cola, and highlights of cinnamon spice all come together. Tannins are round, almost silky, and the wine fades in a graceful finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This blend of 50% Cabernet Franc, 37% Petit Verdot and 13% Malbec is dark purple in color, with rich blackberry and brambleberry tones accented by liquorice and bubble gum. The rich palate carries similar dark fruit tones, framed by silky-soft tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This blend of 33% Cabernet Franc, 27% Merlot, 27% Petit Verdot and 13% Cabernet Sauvignon is mildly concentrated on the nose and palate, with rubbery blackberry, cranberry juice and geranium leading the way. Light bodied, with a soft grip of tannins, these flavors lead to a short finish of green peppercorn."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Hints of thyme, sage, violet and coffee are just a handful of the nuances that color this composed Bordeaux-style Blend. Brisk acidity balances the bold, ripe fruit, leading to a fresh, herbaceous finish with penetrating tannins. Drink now over a long evening, or better yet, cellar it for 3–5 years to let all of the components come together."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The vines of this estate are in the Médoc village of Lamarque in the Moulis area between Margaux and Saint-Julien. This second wine of Chateau du Cartillon is light and fruity with some black currant flavors along with acidity and a smoky touch. It is a juicy wine that will develop quickly. Drink from 2019.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A fine vein of graphite extends through this bold yet refined Bordeaux-style red. It's robustly fruity, bursting with cranberry, red cherry and raspberry flavors, but enticingly savory as well, nuanced by hints of leather and balsamic vinegar. Dense tannins should smooth out between 2018 and 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"From an appellation better known for Zin, this blend of 41% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc, 21% Malbec, 8% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot works well—a study in chocolate-covered blackberry and blueberry with a powerful firmness balanced by moderate acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Dense, dark wine, with good black plum, fig, coffee and sweet raisin flavors. The ripe tannins fit well into this fruit mélange, with definite richness from new wood. There is good, juicy power here, as the wine finishes well with both dry tannin and fresh acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bold and fruity, this ripe, smoky wine has red berry and blackberry fruit flavors cut with acidity. This blend is smooth in texture, with a full, rich fruitiness on the palate. It will age further, although the wine is ready to drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The wine suffers from heavy extraction that has left wood rather than fruit. Somewhere in there, the black-currant fruit and acidity are struggling. It will soften, although that wood will remain a problem."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Juicy red plums and cherries, vanilla and smoke are pleasant on the nose and palate of this Bordeaux-style red from Istria, but gain freshness and verve from layers of bramble, menthol and fresh herbs. Full bodied with exceptionally integrated tannins that are soft and round, it's a big surprise at $13."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Round and easy on the palate, this wine combines 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot. Approachable dark fruit meets touches of leather and garrigue. It's a full-bodied and concentrated wine that's still developing in the bottle."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Dry and tannic, this imparts red fruit around a greenish tinge of tobacco leaf, the tannins overly robust."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Already deliciously fruity, this is a big, ripe, black-fruit-dominated wine. To balance the black currant flavor, there is a fine sense of structure, which offers a dry edge along with final acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The Becots, Gérard and Dominique, have produced a stylish, modern wine that powers black, sweet fruits through the deceptively soft tannins. Tarry flavors and layers of new wood give the wine a new world character. How long it will last is open to question at this stage. It is certainly developing quickly."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Barnard Griffin's über-reserve, this extremely limited offering is a Bordeaux-style blend, produced from old vines at one of Washington's founding vineyards. A spicy, peppered candy note in the nose precedes juicy pomegranate fruit, toasted walnuts, mocha and more."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This generous and full-bodied wine is full of juicy red berry fruits, ripe tannins and just enough structure to support its opulent character. Wood aging gives a fine-grained texture that will allow it to age. Drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Vines on steep slopes leading down to the Gironde estuary give this estate a good exposure. This wine is structured and laced with firm tannins. It has a balanced character that will allow it to age further, although the black-currant flavors are beginning to shine. Drink from late 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is dry, dominated by the new-wood flavors and toasty character that hide any fruit. The lean structure will probably remain. The property is owned by the Kressmann family."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"91–93. Barrel sample. Rich and soft, this wine has fine acidity and sweet black fruits. It has a good depth of rich flavor, and a palate that's rounded and smooth. The tannins show a velvet character."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Still lean and structured, this is a cool-feeling, young wine. It has dry tannins and a chewy texture that needs to soften. At the back, juicy black currant fruits show promise for the future. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A lovely wine, soft and supple, with a superb tannin structure framing the most interesting and delicious flavors. Blackberries, blueberries, red and black currants, anise and cedar notes all come together in balanced harmony, leading to a long, dry finish. Not an ager, but an elegant Napa Valley wine to drink now and over the next few years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Spicy new wood flavors dominate this otherwise strongly fruity wine. The tension between the two promises a rich, full and ripe wine for the future. There is enough weight, acidity, blackberry fruit and richness to balance out the wood aging. Give this dense wine until 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is the winery's Meritage red, although with 75% Cabernet Sauvignon they could have bottled it as that variety. It's nearly always Sebastiani's best Bordeaux-style wine, but the '05 is something of a letdown from past vintages. It's elegantly structured and nicely flavored, with subtle currant, cherry, olive and smoke flavors, but has a bitter taste throughout."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Lightly volatile aromas of raspberry, vanilla bean, and cherry are followed by smooth fruit and barrel flavors. The oak seems to get in the way at times."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"There is plenty of ripe fruit here. With soft tannins and a generous structure, the wine is rich, full of berry and red-plum flavors and with just enough tannins. Give this fruity wine until 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A dense, tannic and concentrated Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, this conveys boysenberry and anise among the thick walls of structure and intensity that give this wine full-bodied flavor. Let it open and enjoy with hearty fare."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Charred, meaty aromas and equally smoky flavors give a rowdy personality to this full-bodied blend of Bordeaux grapes. Firm tannins and underlying acidity create a puckering mouthfeel."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe berry aromas set the scene for this balanced, juicy wine. Full of black currant and berry flavors, it's already delicious with its fruitiness. The tannins, though, need to calm down somewhat, and the wine will be better from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Densely textured, this has firm and dark tannins. Powerful notes of rich berry and stone fruit give weight to this concentrated wine. This needs time to age."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The nose on the winery's annual Pomerol-focused blend of mostly Cabernet Franc and Merlot remains tightly wound, with purple fruit and tobacco just barely poking out. It's richly textured on the palate but the dark fruit flavors remain elegantly restrained throughout the sipping experience."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Smoky wood flavors dominate this dense, wood-aged wine. It also has juicy red berry flavors and will be generous and very fine when mature. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,This generous wine is on the fruity side of the 2014 spectrum. Blueberry and black-currant fruits are supported by the spice and tannins from wood aging. The wine is likely to develop easily over the medium term. Drink from 2020.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A wine that shows firm tannins, fruit and wood acidity. It is now ready to drink, a wine that will remain firm and dry."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Slowly the potential of this impressive wine is coming out. It is rich, the new wood flavors blending with the ripe blackberry sweetness and tight tannins. Chocolate flavor power through this concentrated wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Juicy and spicy flavors give a wine that layers fruit and ginger. Blackberries are the dominant fruit while the spice adds a bite that is almost exotic.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A sad approximation of the old Anthology, whose quality has been sinking in recent years. The ‘05 is not quite ripe, with vegetal notes to the blackberries and sweet oak. It's an okay wine, but this once-fine wine's best days are gone."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"91-93 Barrel sample. Rich and spicy wine, with dark tannins, very black fruits and a solid structure. At the same, very approachable, rich and juicy."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Vanilla, black-cherry soda and a berry crème brûlée character combine for a very playful and fun nose on this bottling. The palate tightens up that fun a bit but stays sexy, offering dark chocolate, red-berry jam and a shred of mint."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A big, dark, rich wine with an impressively opulent structure allied to fresh, bright Merlot character. The flavors of black berry juice are followed by chocolate, bitter coffee and vibrant acidity, which gives freshness to the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine has too much tannin for its own good. It's tough and bitter, showing wood and extraction. In this difficult Bordeaux vintage, the vineyard produced less than half what is normal."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This five grape Bordeaux-style blend has a sharp, spicy aroma, a strong suggestion of clove. The fruit is quite light and tastes of strawberries, but quickly is overtaken by the tannins and the barrel flavors. Drink soon."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"With an edge of tannin and with sweet strawberry fruits, this Doublet family clairet is an attractive wine. Dark pink in color, it appears and tastes rich. With its peppery aftertaste, this has to be a wine designed for food."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Cabernet Sauvignon (65%) takes the lead in this wine, followed by Merlot (29%), Malbec (3%) and Cabernet Franc (3%). Aromas of cocoa, vanilla, graphite, and red and black fruit are followed by palate-coating fruit and barrel flavors backed by firm but well-integrated tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Initially mineral and austere, but after a moment, the richer sweet berry fruits come through. The wine has spice from new wood as well as a solid core of dry tannins. The aftertaste reveals the dense texture, and the aging potential."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"While there is probably plenty of ripe fruit somewhere in this wine, it is all too much dominated by high toast wood flavors which will likely always give a tough character. It only just hints at a more generous side."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Vivid berry flavors drive this medium-bodied, lively and firmly tannic wine. It has good acidity that combines with the fine-grained tannins for an especially tangy mouthfeel."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Deep berry, cinnamon, briar and mint aromas. Firm, even backwards, it is trim and elegant, yet solid. Black fruit and bitter-chocolate flavors abound. The finish is especially tight, with dry tannins and complex mineral and earth elements. Huge but refined, the quintessential iron fist in a velvet glove; it needs time."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Owned by members of the Cruse family, one of the ancient merchants families in Bordeaux, this estate has produced a fruity wine that is juicy with blackberry flavors and considerable acidity. It will need time for the dry core to fill out and balance. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a complex wine that shows sweet berry fruits, ripe tannins and new wood flavors. It is dense and chewy while also being full of rich fruits. This is a wine for aging, although its smooth character suggests it will age relatively quickly."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"New wood aromas and flavors make this selection seem dominated by toast, giving it a dry, tannic character. The ripe plum fruit is submerged and is likely to surface only after 3–4 years of aging when a powerful, upfront wine will emerge."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is a blend of Merlot (45%), Cabernet Franc (34%), Petit Verdot (8%), Malbec (8%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Brooding aromas of green herbs, flowers and cherry lead to a ripe full-flavored palate that shows a fine sense of balance."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The 2014 Coleraine is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Franc. Some herbal, cabbagey notes blow off with air to reveal vanilla, cedar, cassis, blackberry and mocha. Full bodied and plush, this wine is soft enough to drink now, but could probably go 20-plus years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a smoothly crafted, delicate blend of 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc. Its ethereal nature does not preclude plenty of quiet power, which provides a sturdy foundation for the bright cassis and raspberry flavor. Subtle spice box, cedar and cigar add to its complexity and length."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The dry, hard tannins are very Saint-Estèphe, but the wine bears its weight well, giving good black plum and berry fruits and a dense texture. It has a solid, chunky feel to it, dark and firm. The finish is more fresh and juicy."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is a success for the vintage with its ripe Cabernet flavors and dark, dense tannins. It is fruity certainly, with a juicy, perfumed background. However, the structure and texture show best—firm and dry, indicating a good potential. This concentrated wine will not be ready to drink before 2024."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 60% of this wine, with the rest Merlot (29%) and Cabernet Franc. It presents aromas of macerated cherries, licorice and whiffs of game. The flavors are lush and ripe, with firm but well-integrated tannins providing support."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A firm, dry textured wine, with tannins that are now losing more fruity character. It needs at least an hour in a decanter to show its more balanced nature. Ready to drink."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"One of the labels from the Bonnet vineyard of André Lurton, this red follows the approachable, fruity style of these wines. Red berry fruits and soft tannins make it already drinkable."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe and fruity, this is a delicious wine. It has layers of red fruits and balanced acidity along with a gently smoky back taste. The structure is light, crisp and with the freshness that is typical of the vintage this close to Bordeaux. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is just over half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. The aromas of herb, barrel spice, black cherry and coffee need time to reveal themselves fully. The dark cherry and blackberry flavors show richness and polish. Give it an extended decant if opening in the near term but it will be worth it. It will be best from 2020 to 2027."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Allspice, ginger, Red Vines and red-fruit aromas are out front on this Cabernet Sauvignon (80%) dominant wine. The palate possesses weight and suppleness to the mouthfeel, with lightly grainy tannins providing the frame."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Fruity and ripe, the wine also has some solid structure to give it a core of dark tannins. The black-currant fruits are developing well, bringing their crispness to the party. Drink this wine from 2018."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"For such a young wine, this is surprisingly mature. Its tannins have softened and rounded, becoming well integrated with the black currant flavor and bright acidity. It's an attractive choice to drink now or over the next few years, but not for long-term aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe and juicy, this full-bodied wine has black plum and berry fruits that are well integrated into the juicy acidity and ripe tannins. The wine will develop quickly, so drink from late 2016."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine has attractive black-currant fruits and fresh, light acidity. It's an early-developing wine with soft tannins and a stalky backdrop. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is an austere wine that's tough on the palate and with high acidity. The black currant fruitiness is still developing, so the wine shouldn't be drunk before 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"From the Poujeaux section of Moulis, Dutruch Grand Poujeaux is still family-owned and -inhabited. This is deliciously fruity and the juicy black-currant flavor is firmly balanced by ripe, generous tannins. A concentrated wine that will certainly age well."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Assembled from the same lots as the winery's more expensive varietal wines, this high-powered, Bordeaux-style blend is one of Walla Walla's best values. Big and bursting with dark-fruit flavors of fig, black cherry and cassis, the barrel aging adds espresso and chocolate in generous amounts. There's noticeable heat on the finish, but no lack of potent flavor."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Though labeled as a red blend, at 94% this could be a varietally labeled Merlot and it drinks like it. Aromas of cocoa, raspberry and spice box are followed by plump, soft chocolate and raspberry flavors accented by tart acids that hold the balance through the finish."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Very much in the food style of Bordeaux, this wine shows the freshness of the 2006 vintage, while also offering some ripe weight. Flavors of fresh black currants edged with black plum skin are supported by a firm line of tannins, finished with a sweet, juicy, fleshy aftertaste."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A new-wood-dominated wine, this is very toasty and extracted, and it is losing some of its fruit in the process. It has a fine structure that will fill out when the black currant flavor gets a chance to shine. Keep for 4–5 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe berry fruits and gentle, dusty tannins give this wine a rich character. Acidity keeps it fresh, although a good structure lies behind that crisp surface. With its juicy fruit, it is ready to drink, but will be better from late 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"High alcohol, softness and tremendously ripe fruit combine to craft a wine of heady opulence. With raspberry and cherry pastry, chocolate fudge and anise liqueur flavors, it's almost a dessert wine, except that the finish is dry."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A dry, tannic wine that is firmly structured. A sense of extraction masks the light and fresh black currant fruitiness. Give it until 2017 to soften."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a finely etched wine with just the right balance between its ripe fruits and tannins. Structured while also juicy, it has a mint and black-currant freshness as well as a dry core that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Unusually for the Médoc, this wine has a significant percentage (14.5%) of Cabernet Franc as well as 12.5% Petit Verdot. These two grapes give the wine its perfume and its dark color. They add to the rich tannins and juicy black currants that pack the wine. Drink this fine wine from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,This juicy wine's considerable acidity gives freshness and a less pleasant lemon flavor that cuts into the ripe black currant fruit. Herbs and dry tannins at the end suggest an underripe character.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Ripe and fruity, this is already a delicious wine. It has blackberry fruit, sweet tannins and acidity that percolates through the ripe texture. Generous and open, it is almost ready to drink."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,This is a lush wine that oozes with the superripe flavor of sweet blackberry. The firm tannins and dense structure act as a counterbalance and push the wine into a more structured sphere. The fruit quality and overall balance promise 4–5 years of aging.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The leading Bergerac brand is made by Bordeaux négotiant Yvon Mau. It's soft with easy tannins and some blackberry fruit flavors. Ready to drink now, showing some good ripeness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Fruity and rather soft, this already shows maturity. It's an attractive, red-fruited wine that's light and fragrant. Not for aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Big, ripe and juicy, this solidly based wine also has great fruitiness. Black fruits, some bitter chocolate and licorice point to ripeness and wood aging. It has a rich texture, its spiciness bringing out the plum and damson fruits. For aging over the medium-term, drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine shows mint aromas and big black-fruit flavors. With high toast wood aging, it feels extracted, with bitter chocolate paralleling the blackberry fruits. It has considerable power and density and needs aging. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of 55% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot, this wine offers generous aromas of café au lait, butterscotch, blackberry, herb and barrel spice. Flavors are focused and rich, backed by lightly dry tannins. The finish lingers."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Round and lacking form, this shows only tannins. It features some attractive acidity, but it is finally spoiled by a rustic character."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Tight and concentrated, this is a very fine wine. Great acidity and great tannins go with the most intense fruit. Blackberry and black-cherry flavors power through this structured wine. There is also elegance and a fine sense of style. Drink from 2025."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Black currants and spice give this wine its main aromatic character. On the palate, it's light with a dry core that is still dominant. The wine is more about structure and will probably stay that way."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Located north of Margaux village, Deyrem Valentin is a small, family-owned property of 32 acres that represents one of the values of Margaux. This wine is smooth, polished and concentrated, with flavors of wood and a sweet-tasting blackberry. The acidity and tannins demonstrate a fine balancing act. This shows good aging potential."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The Caracal (an African lynx breeding on the estate) is a spicy, dried-fruit driven wine that's ready to drink now.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Moueix-owned premier grand cru classé property quietly goes about producing great wines.

It will age slowly and reveal layers of complexity over the years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Although wood aging in this superior cuvée is prominent, this wine has just enough juicy black fruits to allow it to develop well. Get past the wood, and the wine is rich enough and structured with fruit tannins. Allow the wine to integrate and drink from 2017."

A dark, smoky character brings out the solid tannins that underlie the black currant fruitiness and the balance. Although it doesn't have power, an intensity gives a flavor that lasts in the mouth. Drink this wine from 2018."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is tough, extracted and still very bitter. The fruit is there, well behind the tannic front in this Merlot/Malbec blend. Give the wine until 2017 and decant although it is likely to remain tough. A Châteaux Solidaires wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Firm with tannins, this is a dry wine. Its tough structure dominates the berry fruit, needing time to balance out. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"92-94. Barrel sample. A very firm and closed wine. It has intense tannins, with the fruit following slowly behind. The structure is impressive, while the black-currant flavors are still to show."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Unusually blended from all five Bordeaux varieties with Malbec dominating, this is a wonderfully, rich, complex wine. It shows jammy blackberry and plum flavors, with spice and cocoa overtones and firm, ripe tannins. The finish is dry and long. An impressive introductory wine from Trefethen, off the estate vineyard."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Smooth, dry and rich, this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend shows complex flavors of black currants, black cherries, mocha and cedar. The tannins are thick, but very finely ground, with a sweet nutty taste. Shows real class and finesse. Should develop in the bottle through 2014."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a dense and tannic wine. It has plenty of the structure that is common to the Listrac appellation with a firm character when young; however, it also has swathes of ripe black fruits and acidity that will allow it to fill out very satisfactorily. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a tight and firm wine that will take some time to develop. The fruit, an almost equal blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is all present and will fill out over the next few years. It is a serious dense wine with great aging potential. Drink from 2021."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This big, solid, rich effort is packed with seemingly sweet fruits and firm tannins, with a bitter extracted feel. The wine has great weight, and it's a powerful expression of the rich 2009 vintage."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The wood aging still shows in this wine, although not too aggressively. It also has layers of spice, acidity and plenty of red berry fruits. Let it soften and drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine enjoys the fruitiness of the vintage with its black-currant flavors and light tannic structure. The blend is 50% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc. The Cabernets, with ripe berry flavors that dominate here, give a firm core to the wine while not losing the potential of the fruit. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The wine shows the firmly tannic structure of the vintage. It is dense, packed with dark fruits and dry tannins that are slowly developing. That makes for a rich, black-fruited wine, concentrated and needing to age further. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Although light, this well-balanced wine has good depth. A dry core of tannins backs up the bright red berry and black currant fruits. Acidity and the tannins promise some aging, although the wine is drinkable now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Subtle yet decadent aromas of wild berry cobbler, dried flower, chocolate and smoked meat comprise the nose of this Bordeaux-style red blend. Medium to full bodied, this bears firm yet finessed tannins and composed acids. Added notes of leather and spice unfold on the lingering finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Merlot-driven blend also includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, the grapes grown on upper bench blocks of the producer's estate. It's simple, offering red cherry, currant and cedar flavors, with firm, persistent tannins and a ripe, round mouthfeel."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wine is a blend of Merlot (41%), Cabernet Sauvignon (30%) and Cabernet Franc (29%). Aromas of raspberries, blackberries, barrel spices and red and black currant lead to a rich mouthful of power-packed fruit flavors that lead to a warm finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The wine is all fruit initially and then the firmer tannins kick in. It has a strongly tannic core that leaves the wine dry and tough after 12 months in barrel. The fruit weight should broaden the wine out, giving black fruitiness in the future. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Initially, the acidity cuts through this structured effort. Then the ripe fruits surface, creating a wine that is both rich and firmly textured. It is full in the mouth, rich and age worthy."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Aged for 22 months in French oak—one third new—this is 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot. Nota Bene's wines are not shy about high alcohol, but here the fruit stands up well to the oak treatment and shows no sign of over-ripeness. A good spine supports a rich wine with black fruits, balanced acids, and a big streak of espresso."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Big, bold and juicy, with ripe black fruits that dominate the rich tannins. The power and concentration both promise a good future for this solid, full-bodied wine, so keep for 4–5 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Obviously young and still showing the brief wood aging, this is an attractive and juicy wine with ripe red berry fruits, spice from the wood and a soft texture. It should be ready to drink by 2015."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The vineyard around the renaissance palace of Bacalhôa was first planted with Cabernet Sauvignon in the mid-20th century.

It is a wine for holding, so drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"From organic grapes, this blend of 65% Cabernet Franc and 35% Merlot shows roasted coffee, chocolate, peppercorn and beef char on the savory nose. Rustic red cherry and tart cranberry show on the sip, which is dominated by a woody spice and hints of thyme, tarragon and leather."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A parcel within the Château Simard vineyard gives this wine that features plenty of fruitiness, with attractive acidity and black currant flavors. It also has structure, a touch of minerality and final, dry tannins, all of which will allow it to age. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A wine of architectural strength and classical proportions, this has straight lines that mark the packed, concentrated fruits, which are sustained by its tannins. This is certainly the best wine that Léoville-Poyferré has produced, sumptuous while so finely structured."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Fruit tones of fig and raspberry are threaded with hints of sweat, turmeric, herb and cocoa. Medium in body, the palate has acids that feel slightly soft, with fine-grained tannins that add some support."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A smooth, superripe wine, full of the sweetest fruit, big and rich. It is opulent, a powerhouse of dense Merlot fruits, rounded out with soft tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a dry wine although the fruit does show potential. It is concentrated and firm, tannins foremost. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Although this youthful wine has obviously been in plenty of wood, it has the weight to reveal a promising future. So while the spice and toastiness are present now, they will soon integrate with the fine tannins and blackberry fruits. Drink this from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The wine is ripe and perfumed. Mint and sweet eucalyptus aromas are followed on the palate by ripe tannins and strawberry fruits. This is an attractive wine that will be ready to drink from 2018.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This is a very successful wine, made in the Paso style of soft voluptuousness and plenty of ripe, fruity flavors. Blended from the classic Bordeaux varieties, it's rich in blackberry and blueberry jam, buttered toast and spice flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Should develop over the next six years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,This ripe wine shows a good balance between its rich black fruits and the densely tannic structure. It is still young and for now the wine is firm and dry. The ripe fruit will blossom over the next few years to give warmth and richness. Drink from 2018.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"All five of the major Bordeaux red varieties are represented here, with Merlot the largest percentage at 44%. The wine offers black pepper, clove, cassis and blackberry around a huge structure of dry, mouth-coating tannins that make this a good pairing with red meat, the juicier the better."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Stature is always a Bordeaux blend, but varies in vineyard source each year. This '04 is soft, utterly delicious and fully drinkable now. It's rich in black currant, cherry pie filling, plum, anise and spice flavors, generously aged in smoky new oak. Made in the modern style, it will hold effortlessly through 2012, at least."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"89–91. Barrel sample. One of the largest vineyards in the Médoc, Larose Trintaudon has produced a reliable, attactively fruity wine with soft tannins, blackberry-juice flavors and a crisp acidity at the end."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A softly juicy wine, this is missing structure while it has plenty of fruit. It's ripe, rich and juicy; a pleasure to drink in 2–3 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This wood-aged wine conveys mint aromas and new-wood flavors. It is rich, full in the mouth and developing quickly. The black currant fruitiness is fresh, giving a delicious, juicy wine to drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot dominant blend comes from some top quality vineyards that are seldom seen in a wine at this price, including Seven Hills, Canoe Ridge, Wallula, Tapteil and Champoux. Aromas of herb, berry, cherry and toasty spices give way to clearly high-quality fruit that has seen a lot of love and care. It's a big time winner at this price."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"The quality of Casarena's wines range from excellent to not great, with all points in between represented. This Malbec-led blend is heavy and raisiny on the nose, then syrupy in the mouth, with flavors running straight to candied and flat."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Too much wood aging yields a wine that is lean and lacks fruitiness. It has intense dark, burnt wood flavors and doesn't have the weight to round out."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Right now this is not typically soft and lush like a cult Cab, but hard in tannins, with minerality like little particles of granite. Buried deep down is a pirate's treasure of ripe, intense blackberry fruit. New oak, to the tune of 94%, doesn't cloud the wine, suggesting this blend's its intensity and concentration. The wine is comprised of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, sourced throughout Sonoma County. Clearly this is one for the cellar; drink after 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Produced by the winemaking team of Léoville las Cases, this wine comes from a separate part of the estate. The wine, with its dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon, is dense with tannins as well as dark fruit. It is firm, powerful and a very fine wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2024."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux-style blend is extraordinarily rich, with flavors of raspberry and cherry tart, milk chocolate, red licorice and sweet oak, plus soft, gentle tannins. It shows a direct deliciousness that makes it easy to like."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"While there is a mineral austerity to this wine, it has the potential for richness. It offers dark berries and sweet plums under the dense layer of tannins. Give it 2–3 years at least."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Mostly Merlot (51%) and Cabernet Franc (40%), rounded out by Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this wine opens with aromas of black cherry and dark fruit alongside floral and barrel--spice accents. The palate is focused and layered, bringing waves of fruit flavors supported by enough structure to go the distance."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft with cranberry and red currant accents, this fairly priced wine is subtle in tannin and oak, with a core of succulent black cherry and clove flavor. Approachable and round on the palate, it's a good choice for big gatherings."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dark and full-bodied for a rosé, with heavy-handed flavors of raspberry jam and toast that have a vegetal edge."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The estate's reserve, this pure Cabernet Sauvignon has been given 22 months in new French oak. Sculpted and well-defined, it offers raspberry and blueberry fruit, set in lovely tannins. The finish shows details of orange blossoms, citrus and coffee grounds. At this time, the new oak is a bit overwhelming, but additional bottle age or decanting for several hours will help to balance it out."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dry, tannic and rough in the mouth, this offers pleasant blackberry, red currant, spice and cedar flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Bright cassis, strawberry and red currant flavors are on vivid display in this 100% varietal wine. Soft and easy to enjoy, it impresses with full-bodied accetnes of dusty cigar and mocha."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Grapy berry and raisin aromas include notes of baking spices. This feels wide but wiry, with tartaric acidity at the core. Generic berry flavors end with a dry drawing finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Slightly baked and raisiny on the nose, with char and licorice aromas backing that up. The palate is more acidic than you'd expect, with an outsized zesty bite to go with snappy, herbal plum and cherry tomato flavors. Baked and warm on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A huge, powerful Cabernet, this is stuffed with blackberries, cherries, raisins and sweet mocha, with a finish that's long and sensually sweet in spices and oak, offering immediate gratification."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"If you have a ¬bottle of this in your cellar, drink it now. The wine still has some fruit flavors backed by roasted almond and spice but there are also barnyard or Band-Aid tones that seem to be taking over."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine offers notes of sugared plum, herbs and tire rubber. It's lighter in style with plump, slightly sweet blackberry and cherry flavors with a wash of tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This soft, simple wine, with small touches of Malbec and Petit Verdot, delivers sizable tannin atop notable acidity. Tart red currant and cherry meet cedar and a taste of toffee, allowing for a pleasantness on the palate that's rich and ripe."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This 100% varietal wine opens with a strong bouquet of black licorice, maybe even fennel, before big, boisterous tannins stomp the stage. Full bodied and exuberant in blackberry and black cherry, the oak is measured. A backbone of structure could stand up to aging."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Smoky aromas of burning hickory are matched by lemon peel and earthy berry scents. This is a rubbery feeling wine, with grabby tannins. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and rubber suggest plastic. On the finish, lactic oak wrestles with a residual hint of green."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Deserves its score on the basis of its dry, classic structure and the way the currant, olive, mint and oak flavors come together in complexity. Not an ager, but a fine wine for now. Mostly from Lake County, with Sonoma and Napa in the blend."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A very good wine, although a very young one that needs time. It's not because the tannins are hard, because they're not. But the primary blackberry and cherry flavors haven't married with the oak, despite the wine being more than three years of age. The grapes come from a tenderloin of the appellation that's known for quality. Best after 2009."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tastes pretty dry and tannic, with lots of astringency, and finishes hard and gritty. Not a wine you want to drink now. But there's a huge core of blackberries hidden below, accompanied by a burst of juicy acidity. Seems to have the balance for cellaring. The score reflects what this Cab will likely be in 6–8 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Meaty and full on the nose, and convincing overall. The palate is a touch scratchy and raw, but it houses nice cassis, cherry and raspberry flavors. Some grit and bite to the finish is followed by flavors of caramel and sweetness, and overall the wine seems well made and natural. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Compact and candied on the bouquet, with dusty red berry aromas. Feels blocky and tannic but healthy, with cassis and blackberry flavors touched up by typical Chilean herbal notes. A flavorful wine for everyday drinking."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This largely tannic wine clearly needs time to open in the glass or on the table. It initially shows herbal elements around a core of clove and black cherry. Well-made, it's structured and a good match for meals."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The 2004 was soft and immediately enjoyable. This '05 is tannic and better structured and needs some time. It displays a wealth of black cherry and currant flavors. Hold if you can until after 2008, and should develop well for an additional 4 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A new bottling from the winery, made from vines grown 2,000 feet up the mountain that were planted only in 2001. It's far too immature to drink now or anytime soon. The tannins are thick and on lockdown, the blackberry, cassis and cherry fruit all primary and not yet integrated with the oak. But these parts are high-quality and need time to mesh and develop. Best after 2010 through 2016 and beyond."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A fairly oaky bouquet with overt wood grain, vanilla and creamy aromas includes cherry and plum scents. A mostly fresh, choppy palate is a bit rough, while currant and spiced-plum flavors end with woody, medicinal accents. Overall this works well."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Ruby garnet in color, this has aromas of red plums, purple flowers and black fruit conserves. There are nice bright fruit flavors on the palate, with touches of tobacco leaf and tart cherry on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cobblestone's regular Cabernet is very consistent from year to year, a good wine but not a great one. This 2007 is superfruity, with a blast of blackberries, cola and currants. Drink now–2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Blended with 15% Merlot and aged in both French and American oak, this wine shows generous eucalyptus and mint notes. The smoothly textured, rounded palate is marked by black cherry and woody perfume."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Saucy aromas of stewed plum and tomato ragu lack clarity. This is midlevel Cabernet, with a light bounce to its step. Generic cherry, cassis and licorice flavors finish with acidic kick but no sense of refinement."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cool, herbal aromas of tomato leaf, oregano and beef stew set up a chewy palate with grabby tannins. A mix of savory spices and minty, baked berry flavors end with peppery notes, chunky weight and a tough of heat. Drink through 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sweet barrel flavors set off pretty fruit, a generous mix of cherries and berries, with juicy underlying acidity. This wine needs quite a bit more time to unfold. For the moment, all the components are right but the integration is not complete."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Starts out fine and impressive, but as this wine breathes a certain imbalance emerges. There's a green unripeness to the blackberries and cherries, although the wine does exhibit fine tannins and a balanced approach to oak. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine is rich and flashy with flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, red currant, mocha, oak and spice. Firm tannins and zesty acidity add structure and brightness. It's tasty now, but should be better by 2016, as it begins to develop bottle notes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This lip-smackingly complex, pure varietal wine from a prime Napa Valley location is awash in floral chewing tobacco and roasted coffee aromas. These expand on the palate into cedar and black currant, remaining softly alluring through a base of power. Decant or cellar through 2020–2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This reserve tastes oakier and stronger than Jarvis's regular 2006 Cabernet. With near-perfect balance, this is awesome. Flavors of blackberries and black currants are complexed with minerals and herbs and indefinable things from the soil. It's hard in tannins and rich in spicy, smoky new oak. Hold until at least 2014, and it should continue to age well beyond that."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Here's a wine that will surprise you. It has real richness and varietal flavor, and is dry and balanced, with the weight you want in a nice Cabernet. Might even get a little better in another year or two."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"An amazing wine, possibly the winery's finest Sycamore ever. It's ripe and concentrated, in typical California Cabernet fashion. It dazzles with black currants, crème de cassis and chocolate, yet is firm and dry throughout. The tannin-acid balance is near perfect. Really impresses for sheer power and authority, and will age for a very long time. Best after 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"An attractive Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with varietal aromas of cedar, red currants and tobacco while the palate offers dried black cherry, exotic spice and licorice. It's still tightly wound with firm but fine-grained tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a barrel selection, presumably limited in cases. It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities. This deserves its high score for sheer opulence and great Napa structure. Delicious now, and could easily age for at least 10 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Pencil shavings and leather aromas mark the entry of this robustly full-bodied wine. It has a pronounced forest floor character, while blackberry and black cherry flavors combine with licorice and dark chocolate, filling out the richer notes that interweave throughout the palate, leading into a long finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This vintage is thick in dusty chocolate, clove and cinnamon tones, with a sage underbite that gives it a wild edge. Soft, approachable tannins provide a crowd-pleasing entry and midpalate, while the finish reveals the wine's full-bodied, riper side."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine comes from an up-and-coming vineyard site. Very varietal aromas of black cherry, herb and cedar give way to soft fruit flavors and lightly grainy tannins. The tart acidity keeps the interest high. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The aromas are all high toned, with notes of baking spice, green herb, berry and wood spice. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied, with appealing well-balanced flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rubbery and warm on the nose, with earthy plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is full and bouncy, with appropriate plum, berry and cassis flavors. Nice for standard New World Cab, with fig, chocolate and no buttery, sloppy oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Cabernet starts out tight and resistant. Although it has plenty of ripe cherry and blackberry fruit, there's something pinched about the mouthfeel. It's a good wine that will benefit from airing, but doesn't seem likely to improve in the cellar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This dark, fully saturated red wine starts with scents of eucalyptus, black cherry and dill. The ample weight and dusty texture is appealing, but purists may quibble with the amount of dill in this robust Cabernet. Drink now–2025."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A slightly confected, slightly herbal Cab, with sweet cherry fruit that finishes tart. Still, it's nicely creamy in texture and while simple, is pleasant enough for a midweek quaff. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From a 22-acre site in the middle of the appellation, this is an impressive wine, softened by the addition of 6% Merlot. It boasts crushed rock, black currant and licorice flavors, with an attractive sanguine note. Pencil shavings, black pepper and cigar accents are present throughout."
Cabernet Sauvignon,This behemoth of a wine grabs your attention with its deep color and late harvest aromas then coats the palate with superripe cherry and baking spice flavors. It comes across as Port-like despite its dryness and very firm tannins. Best after 2022.
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Here's an inky black and densely concentrated Cabernet Sauvignon that would pair with grilled sausage or barbecued steak. The wine is soft, round and slightly sweet on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Muddled blackberry and plum give this 70% Cabernet Sauvignon a warmth and complexity, accented by clove and herb. Smaller percentages of Merlot, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Malbec add softness and structure, as well as a layering of blueberry fruit, with a bite of pepper highlighted on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"One of the most succulent and drinkable Napa Cabernets of the '08 vintage. With Merlot added to the blend, it's rich in blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar, with firm but pliant tannins that give a beautiful structure."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is made from fruit sourced from the Milbrandt, Olsen and Kiona vineyards, which are located in three different AVAs. The wine is packed with black fruit, with light accents of smoke, toast, espresso and dark chocolate that add interest to the finish. Merlot and Petit Verdot are also in the mix."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft, thin and simple. Other than that, it's not bad, with proper blackberry and spice flavors and smooth tannins. Give it greater concentration, and the score would rise."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Bashful, mild aromas of herbal berry fruits and mint are followed by a full, round and solid feeling palate. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and blueberry register as fairly ripe and dark, while the finish displays toasty notes, spice flavors and mild heat. This is a step up from good and basic."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of red fruit, vanilla and cigarbox start this Cabernet Sauvignon from Greece. Its flavors are rich but balanced—cinnamon, cedar, cherry and savory spice—and the wine finishes clean and dry. Elegant with ageable potential."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Oaky tones of vanilla bean, wood and sweet spice are at the fore of the bouquet, while notes of black cherry, stewed plum and raspberry coulis provide a solid backbone throughout. The mouthfeel is smooth and supple, with easy, approachable ripe-fruit flavors and a lingering hit of baking spice."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A solid, dry Cab that shows the slightly rustic tannins and herbs of Dry Creek. Oak adds sweet vanilla and caramel notes to the black currants and cherries. Now through 2012."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"With 4,300 bottles produced and only 110 cases imported, this is a gorgeous small production Cab that should be grabbed up when you find it. It's all dark fruit and sweet spice with notes of black currant, fig, plum, leather and cigar box. With firm tannins and a medium-full weight, this is a big but balanced wine that's easy to enjoy now or can be cellared for a couple of years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The wine is fantastic, albeit tannic. It's not a gushy one to open tonight. The tannins have a dry astringency, but even so, you can taste fabulously ripe blackberries, black cherries and currants. This wine should begin to come into its own next year and hold for many years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"With fruit mostly from Northridge Vineyard along with Katherine Leone and Clifton Hill, this wine displays aromas of herbs, vanilla, mocha and green wood. Coffee and cherry flavors are sweet and high octane with light squeeze of tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is the kind of Cabernet that's soft and accessible enough to drink now. It's rich in blackberry, cherry and spice flavors, with a sweet edge of charred wood. Saved from mere simplicity by a fine, firm tannic structure."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The 10% Petit Verdot stiffens up the tannins and has a lovely violet-scented floral component that counterpoints the cassis and black cherry fruit. It's a young, tight and beautifully crafted wine that has barely come out of the barrel; it's still shut down and shy. But all the right stuff is there for a long-lived, elegant and silky wine with great breed and style."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vivid aromas of tart cherry and cranberry are followed by equally vivid, crisp and tangy flavors that echo the cherry and cranberry but add richer plum notes and nuances of cinnamon, nutmeg and cedar. This is so well balanced and bright that it tastes lip-smacking delicious now but will improve with age through at least 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"La Fornace is a dark, savory expression of Cabernet Sauvignon that shows aged tertiary aromas of dark spice, cured meat and prune. It feels rich and dense, with a gritty quality to the tannins and long endnotes of bacon, black pepper and leather. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Intensely ripe plum and blackberry flavors contrast dusty mineral tones and scintillating acidity in this Cabernet Sauvignon. It's sharper and more angular than Paumanok's Tuthill's Lane bottling, but has an austerity and elegance that's captivating. Its fine firm tannins are edgy still, but should yield beautifully over the next decade."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Bright, crisp red cherry and blackberry flavors drive a refreshing, fruity personality. Touches of nutmeg and vanilla show through, but this is not an oaky wine by any means. It will please a crowd and pair well with a wide variety of foods."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From a valley-floor site off of the Silverado Trail just north of St. Helena, this Cab is a departure for the producer, based atop Spring Mountain. The flavors are ripe and jammy in raspberry and blackberry, almost liqueur-like, before finding balance in tangerine-tart acidity. With firm, chalky tannins providing backbone, the finish is sprinkled in black cherry and caramel."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dark as night, and with such a dramatic aroma, you can't wait to taste it. Huge and hedonistic, an Incredible Hulk of a wine bursting with blackcurrants and cassis and smoky oak. Luxurious tannins make for a smooth, gentle mouthfeel. Enjoy this youthful wine now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's absolutely nothing wrong with this very affordable, concentrated and trimly built wine. Earth and sage aromas lead to bright black cherry and plum flavors, with a typically firm texture for the varietal."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"With sizable additions of Petit Verdot, Merlot and Cabernet Franc and aged nearly two years in new French oak, this wine has lavender scents and soft, rounded edges. Mountain tannins and fresh acidity frame its chocolate and dark, spicy berry flavors. It finishes on a toasted oak note."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a lovely wine to drink now. It's so dry and elegantly constructed, with wonderfully ripe tannins and great integration of oak with the fruit. There's a nice balance of acidity to balance the blackberry, cherry and cola flavors. Drink now, with a brief decant."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Of all the 2012 releases from Mannina, this is the most dense, dark and substantial. Cassis and black cherry fruit is set against a stiff streak of char and coffee, backed with firm, ripe tannins. The length and balance are just right for ripe fruit from young vines."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Opens with floral, cherry, cassis and coconut aromas, which are followed by snappy, acid-driven flavors of raspberry, wood spice and vanilla. A fresh, lively, healthy wine with a toasty/spicy finish and young, clamp-down tannins. Drink now through 2012."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A first bottle was obviously off. A second was better, although still lacking the complexity you want at this price. It was a young Cab, dry and tannic, with a core of cassis and cherries. A few years in the cellar should soften it."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This well-balanced, flavorful and medium-bodied wine will pair nicely with many different meat, poultry and pasta dishes without distracting from the food. It smells lightly spicy, tastes like raspberries and red cherries and has light tannins that add some needed grip."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"An awesome wine—this is so massively intense in blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors, it's hard to believe. From the first sip though the middle palate, it's seemingly sweet with a fruity essence, but the finish is dry and firm. Drink now and for 8–10 years, at the very least."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Coming from Red Mountain's most esteemed vineyard, this wine offers aromas of cocoa, vanilla, coffee bean and dark cherry. The coffee and cherry flavors show exquisite polish and depth, with fruit and barrel flavors playing off each other on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Minty, roasted berry aromas open this well-built Cabernet that's packed with plum, raspberry and wood-spice flavors. There's nothing complicated about this lively, oaky wine that runs long on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Hailing from some of the oldest blocks at this esteemed vineyard, this standout wine opens with aromas of toasty spices, herbs, coffee, dark cherry and earth. The palate is reserved with tightly wound fruit flavors and tannins that need some time to unfurl."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cherry, cassis and spice aromas are mild and comported. The wine feels chewy and just dense enough, with baked cassis, berry and herb flavors that finish toasty and hot, with a rubbery note. Clean aromas and full fruit flavors are this wine's best attributes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A better bottle than the Champoux Cab, this Red Mountain offering brings flavors of raspberry and strawberry preserves. The extra year or two in bottle has softened it up somewhat; though it still shows some signs of both reduction and volatile acidity. This needs to be drunk up; it is not likely to improve."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is the first reserve for this unassuming, low-profile winery whose wines clearly belong in the first rank of Washington's boutiques. It shows classic Cabernet fruit from three top vineyards, long and persistent, yet never over extracted or alcoholic. True Bordeaux style in an elegant, ageworthy wine. Editors' Choice."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft and delicious, this is for drinking now, with a certain elegant fanciness. The blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors are complex and worth repeated sipping."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A beautiful Cabernet, dry, smoothly tannic and impressive for its volume of flavor. Shows a complex range of blackberries, black currants, minerals and oak, with a long, spicy finish. Elegant and powerful at the same time, it should develop in the bottle over the next decade."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A rustic, tannic Cabernet, with sweet, juicy blackberry and spice flavors and an overlay of oak. Good for drinking now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A standard but appealing combination of oak, spice and berry aromas leads to a clampy tannic woody palate. This is spicy and tastes fully oaked, with plum and generic berry flavors in support. On the finish, this tastes of plum, berry and chocolate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This student-produced wine shows aromas of cocoa, cashew and cherry along with green pepper. Flavors are somewhat wood-dominated with vanilla and chocolate riding high over cherry. Overall there are some distractions but there's still much to enjoy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Among the better '98s, this wine's vineyard pedigree shows in the polished fruit and supple tannins, the result of great terroir. The aromas suggest black cherries and blackberries with intense oaky, smoky tones. Particularly notable for the soft, lush mouthfeel, like sipping pure velvet. If the wine were more concentrated it would be classic."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A proportion of the grapes in this wine, accented with 2% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc, comes from the Lewis Vineyard, a respected site in the heart of the appellation. It contributes to the magic, putting forward red currant, sage and crisp red fruit around a strong body, texture and tang of tannin."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Nearly undrinkable for its arch-acidity that's almost still fermenting. The flavors are thin, with barely ripe blackberries and oak-like smokiness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Saucy, spicy berry aromas are earthy. This has a fleshy, jammy mouthfeel and flavors of blueberry, cassis and blackberry. A dry, spicy, lightly herbal finish confirms the wine's above-average status."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"At first pour, it's awfully tough in tannins, and can hardly express itself. After a while, the heart of black currants and cherries opens up generously, making it lovely to drink now and over the next five years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Ripe and sweet in chocolate and blackberries, this is a Cabernet made for drinking now with rich fare, such as short ribs. It's soft in both tannins and acids, which makes it instantly appealing."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Somehow, Mission Estate has managed to produce a prototypical Cabernet for a price that should leave consumers smiling. Cassis, tobacco and cedar notes pick up a mocha shading on the long, mouthwatering finish. It's a soft, supple wine that can be consumed over the next five years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This mouthfilling wine is generously ripe and rich, with hints of herb and mountain brush dancing around soft, rounded layers of plum and cinnamon. The finish is lush and lingering."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Pretty violet and red cherry aromas perfume this aromatic Cabernet Sauvignon. On the palate, ruddy, slightly overripe tones of plum and cherry contrast markedly against a finish that's zesty and tart."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A bit hot and crusty on the nose, with black fruit and herbal notes of olive and bramble. The palate is full but hard as nails, with a tannic bite that is wicked like a shark. Flavors are full and drying due to the tannins, with herbal accents. Finishing flavors of coffee and spice cement its dark, muscular status."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Syrupy and dense, this wine is jammy in plum and vanilla, with indeterminate structure and plenty of oak. Ripe and full-bodied, it has accents of graphite and leather."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"With its dry earthiness, this is classic Jordan. It shows blackberry and black cherry flavors, with an herb note. The tannins are gentle. It will age for years, softening and gaining earthy complexities."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A slightly herbal, minty character gives personality to this full-bodied, generous and richly textured wine. It is attractively dry, nicely tannic, layered with black cherry, wild berry and rosemary notes. Great to drink now through 2020 with rich meats or mushrooms."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Baking-spice, dark-chocolate, vanilla and cocoa aromas resonate on this barrel-forward wine. The palate brings luscious dark-fruit and dark-chocolate flavors, with grainy tannins backing it up. It shows some warmth on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine delivers handsomely for the price, made in a style that embraces balanced herbaceousness and moderate ripeness. Sage, cedar and graphite accent a sizable underlying grip of tannin that should mellow with age and a vibrant layer of black fruit adding context."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is Clos Pegase's basic, least expensive Cabernet, but it shows the effort proprietor Jan Shrem has put into the winery and vineyards over the years. It's quite a good wine, rich with gorgeous tannins framing ripe currant, cassis, chocolate and licorice flavors. At its best now and for a few years, this 100% Cab is, in a word, luscious."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"With 7% Malbec, this hearty red is tightly wound in youthful tannins and a smoky cloud of complex flavor. Leathery and earthy, it traffics in plum, blackberry and chocolate, intertwining the rich ripe fruit into a harmonious whole that pleases the palate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This simple wine is thick with fruit-forward dark cherry and currant elements that find companionship in coffee, graphite and dried herb accents."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vasse Felix's impressively consistent track record with Cabernet continues with the 2009, a mouth-filling, supple wine that still retains a modicum of structure. Bold cassis fruit is balanced by earthy, meaty complexity and finishes long and mouthwatering. Drinkable now, but it should hold easily through 2020, and possibly longer."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is an easy-drinking Cab for enjoying now. It's soft and fruit-forward, bursting with ripe, oak-tinged cherry and raspberry jam flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mount Eden makes their estate Cab the old-fashioned way: to age. The '05 is quite tannic and shut down right now, with a hard astringency, especially on the finish. However, it's rich in black currants, mocha and cedar, and is a natural for many years in the cellar. The score could rise considerably after 2011."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dry and firmly tannic, this Cab has upfront flavors of black currants, plums, mocha and cedary oak. There's some sharpness in the texture that limits ageability, but it's a pretty wine for now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Blended with 25% Cabernet Franc, this engaging wine has aromas of herbs and blackberries. The fruit shows a real sense of vibrancy and purity, laden with tart, cranberry-like acidity and firm, lightly chalky tannins. Just a baby now, it should be at its peak in 2025."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Shows strong, extracted blackberry and black cherry flavors, with a pie-filling spicy intensity. Almost too much of a good thing. Might improve a little in the bottle with a year or two."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is quite a value for the quality, a stellar, medium-bodied, restrained wine that's high-toned and elusive at first aromatically. But it opens in the glass, delighting in blackberry, cherry and a burst of clove, showing skill in winemaking from a blend of vineyards, some valley floor and others mountain."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Cab may be in a bit of a dip. It's awkward, with a sharp, edgy mouthfeel, and as the wine ages, raisin notes creep forward. Still, kudos to Ehret for holding the wine back for so long, as it does possess a certain complexity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Entirely varietal and estate-grown, this big-bottled wine offers a welcome taste of berry pie dusted in cinnamon and clove, the oak sturdy and sweet in vanilla. Luxuriously smooth, the texture is velvety and lush, like a river of dark chocolate. It ends in a flash of black pepper."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Made from certified organic grapes, this wine is both savory and tannic, a tad muted on the nose and wanting in texture. Cassis and pipe tobacco stand out most."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Black plum and blueberry lead the nose on this fruit-forward wine, but there's a dark turned-earth component keeping it serious. Thick black fruit like elderberry ride a firm structure on the palate, where smoked beef, black-pepper spice and a vanilla finish combine for a solid bottling."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tart Montmorency cherry meshes with a cedary cigar-box note on the nose of this wine. The palate is fruit-driven with ripe cherries and blueberries, lifted slightly by anise and bay-leaf spices."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Big, bold and brawny, this wine from a very famous vineyard shows off its savory edge with tufts of clove, leather, gun smoke and tea, providing the requisite dustiness on the palate for which the region is known. Medium bodied and integrated well, it represents the vintage and region in all good ways."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is reminiscent of a cool-climate, Old World wine—balanced and complex, with cedar, sage and dusty graphite notes. With just enough thickness and concentration, it offers additional flavors of plum, cassis and red currant that provide a tangy tartness and a sense of freshness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Too sweet by far, like melted cherry and blackberry jam, with heat from alcohol and a hit of acidity. Drink up."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A mix of small lot-fermented, Horse Heaven Hills Cabernet Sauvignon, some from Champoux, it's fine-tuned, varietal, loaded with cassis and plum, light toast, and ground coffee. Elegant, proportionate, and a fine expression of a great vintage."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Medium-intense scents of black plum- and cherry-skin lead the way on the nose of this rich wine. The palate is dense, with mouthcoating tanning that retail their grip through the tight finish. The fruit is secondary to the structure."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"With just a touch of Merlot in the blend, this juicy, big-boned red tastes of tar, blackberry and cedar, with a suggestion of mossy wood. Integrated in terms of oak and tannin, its highlights include cherry and vanilla among a straightforward complexity of texture that finishes mildly."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"It's not just the fruit, which is immaculately ripe in blackberries and black currants. The wine also stands out for the richness of the oak, so perfectly integrated, and the overall balance. Beautiful acidity and thick, rich, supple tannins come along with a gorgeous, long, dry finish. The vineyard is in Yountville. You'll want to cellar this 100% Cab until at least 2020, and it could be going strong longer."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Fresh mint and mentholated cassis aromas lift the ripe black plum and berry notes on the nose of this wine. The palate is soft and lush, with a slight creaminess that harmonizes with the ripe flavors of black fruit preserves and milk chocolate. A subtle peppery kick lends a spicy character to the finish. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's a pretty touch of carnation florals to the dried black fruit and black cherry center of this wine. Spicy notes of black pepper, whole clove and black tea leaves appear in the mouth alongside juicy blackberry and fudgy brownie flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine has aromas of black plum and black raspberry, with flavors of tart cherry and ripe plum on the palate. The tannins have a bit of grip and the finish is persistent."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The alcohol on this Cabernet is fairly high, yet the wine tastes and feels dry, supple and balanced in the mouth, with tannins so smooth, they're drinkable now. The flavors offer an interesting mélange of blackberries, black currants, green olives, sage and cinnamon. This is certainly an ageable wine that will reward your patience through 2020 or so."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rustic and mouth-coating in leathery tannin, this tri-appellation wine is ripe with sweetened oak. Surely crowd-pleasing, it's a good value for its quality and straightforward approachability."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Bold but sophisticated, this has classic, concentrated Napa aromas and flavors. A luscious, velvety mouthfeel through to a lingering finish. The aroma combines cedar and spice-rack notes with fresh berries and black currants. Flavors are influenced by suave, spicy oak accents that weave in and out of the compelling ripe fruit. It's beautiful to drink now, but will improve through at least 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's a striking minerality that adds depth to varietally characteristic scents of ripe cassis, violets and cedar. Full bodied and densely concentrated, with sweet, black-fruit flavor, it's balanced by brisk acidity and fresh herb flavors that linger on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The aromas of barrel spice, toast, herb and plum are reticent on first pour. On the palate, sweet fruit flavors are supported by lightly grainy tannins. It's straight down the fairway."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"What a great follow-up to the 2009 vintage. You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10–20 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible, locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l,064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Compact dark-fruit aromas turn more jammy with airing. This is gripping in feel, with firm tannins. Flavors of spice, herbs and  black fruits finish with pronounced acidity, leftover tannins and a leathery accent."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This red is smoothly seductive in its lineage of cedar, pencil lead and undercurrent of lifted cassis and red cherry. Lengthy and full bodied, it is generously lush and brooding on the palate, with plenty of length on the smoky, peppery finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This isn't Coonawarra's most elegant wine, but it certainly doesn't lack for character or concentration. Menthol, vanilla, cedar and cassis deliver plenty of flavor in this chunky, full-bodied Cabernet. Charred, mocha-like notes emerge on the long, intense finish. Drink now–2025."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Exotic and complex, this medium-bodied, structured wine is awash with aromas, from charcuterie and mixed nut to cedar and pencil. Anchoring it is a dusty tannic profile and a punch of oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's nothing shy about this red, which is robust, earthy and forcefully tannic. It's a rough-and-tumble red with hearty black cherry, charred wood and truffled chocolate. Big flavors, and big tannins are ready for a big cut of beef."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The nose on this strange Cabernet is mostly about cinnamon and funky smelling fruit. This feels flat, with gum drop flavors that end in a grabby, cloying finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Elegant in fine-grained tannins, this well-made, complex wine offers savory cranberry and cassis plus brighter, spicier red fruit, alongside a layering of graphite, dried herb and chocolate. Full bodied, it remains balanced throughout, finishing with length and breadth."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine is 100% varietal. Pungent aromas of blue fruit, high-toned herb, pencil lead and plentiful barrel spice lead to exceptionally well-balanced polished fruit flavors. Lightly grainy tannins provide support. The balance is exquisite as is the lengthy finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A nice Cab that shows the structure and purity of good terroir. It could use more concentration and intensity, but is totally dry and has savory black currant, mocha and cedar flavors. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lots of new, smoky oak stands out on this polished Cab. Give it a little time in a decanter before you drink, as it pulls together, becoming more powerful and accenting the blackberry and cherry flavors. Should develop for a decade."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Big, dark, earthy and rubbery, with hefty black fruit on the nose and palate. A generous wine with toasty blackberry, cassis and a sprinkle of chocolate, and then a smooth finish. Among value-priced wines from anywhere in the world this is more than one should expect. It's really a nice Cab."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The aromas are brooding, with notes of plum, barrel spice, incense and black cherry. The palate is rich and concentrated with blackberry flavors, backed by firm tannins that need some time to settle in. It's high on the hedonistic scale."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The aromas are promisingly thick and chewy, with assertive notes of black cherry, cigar tobacco and bittersweet chocolate. The creamy mouth delivers more of the same alongside additional elements of cassis, pepper and leathery spice. The mocha-infused finish leaves little else to be desired; drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"An herbal undertone lurks beneath richer, layered concentrations of big tannin and toasty oak in this 100% varietal wine. Meaty and bold, it highlights the variety's ability to be extracted, fruity and nuanced in dried herb, cedar, graphite and sage."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft spice and blackberry on the nose are followed by rich, balanced layers of mint, toast and berry. The wine has a minerality that adds a fresh note to the mix. A big wine but not overly complex, this is a Cabernet for spicy dishes and beef stew. Imported by GBW, LLC."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Oak completely overwhelms this wine. All you can smell and taste is char, caramel and wood spice, and the tannins, which are partly from oak barrels, are dense and hard. It's difficult even to discern any underlying fruit flavors, although if you try hard, you stumble across blackberries."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Cab shows the firm tannins and concentrated fruit of Atlas Peak, combined with the modern style of soft approachability. It's rich in blackberry and cherry pie flavors, with a generous overlay of sweet oak. Seems too sweet and one-dimensional for aging, so drink it now and through 2015 for freshness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A rich, dry young Cabernet, with fresh blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, brightened by a burst of citrusy acidity. The tannins are strong, however, giving the wine a sandpapery astringency. Needs a few years, although it doesn't have the stuffing for the long haul. Your window is around 2014."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A textbook example of Margaret River Cabernet Sauvignon, the 2007 Art Series offers perfumed cassis fruit just tinged with mint and tobacco. There's ample body yet classic Cabernet restraint, so it's not jammy or overdone. The tannins are supple enough to make it enjoyable now, yet sufficient to see it through 2018, at least."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Despite nearly 16% alcohol, this wine manages not to taste hot. The fruit is so powerful, and the tannins so smooth, that it gives a balanced and harmonious mouthfeel. The flavors are a peacock's tail of pure red cherries, red currants and licorice, with a sweet finish of cassis. Should remain enjoyable through 2010."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine has already spent some time in bottle, but should withstand further time in the cellar quite well, through 2020. Inky, it's also fragrant and floral, with a depth of cherry and vanilla, offering big tannin structure and a black-licorice finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a plush and pleasantly concerntrated wine, with rich notes of black plum, cherry, and boysenberry that are spiced by notes of licorice and minty pepper. The medium-weight mouthfeel boasts velvety tannins and a well-build, solid structure. A hint of char unfolds on the lingering finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine offers soft structure and rich, dark blue fruit, revealing its addition of 4% Malbec. Vanilla and cinnamon notes accent the juicy fruitiness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The main taste impression of this superripe Cabernet is of chocolate-covered raisins. Then the even riper notes of prunes emerge. The alcohol, which is 15.7% by volume, gives the finish a glyceriney sweetness. It will satisfy die-hard fans of this Napa style, but it's hard to see this clumsy wine developing in the bottle before the fruit crashes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lusty and forward, this Cab blasts off with explosive cherry, red and black currant, licorice, spicy red plum and mocha flavors. Not very subtle, but it's dry and rich in steak-busting tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The aromas are bright, with notes of green herb, vanilla, clove, wood spice and cherry. The palate brings a mouthful of dark-fruit flavors along with barrel accents, providing a whole lot of texture and appeal."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Very good price for a Cabernet this complex and smooth from Napa Valley. Offers lots of pleasure in the velvety texture and rich flavors of blackberries, cassis and mocha. A big improvement over the '06 bottling. Give it a few hours of decanting."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A nice Cabernet for drinking now, this is basically dry, but has so much ripe black­berry and cherry fruit that there's an impression of sweetness. With soft tannins and an edge of toasty oak, it shows plenty of Napa class."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"An average, everyday Cabernet, okay for the price. It's soft and a little sweet, with sugared blackberry tea flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Duckhorn has an absolutely consistent track record with this bottling from St. Helena, and there's no way they're stopping now. The 2004 is riper and softer than its predecessors, but no less rewarding. It shows elaborately ripe black currant, cherry, chocolate, cedar and violet flavors, and is very well oaked, just oozing vanilla caramel. Drink now or soon."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Ripe blackberry, cherry and oak flavors mark this Cabernet, which is blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. It's tough in tannins, and not going anywhere, but give it a breath of air and it turns into a nice, fancy wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A very nice wine, showcasing the Napa style of lush, plush opulence. It's softly tannic, with ripe blackberry, raspberry, mocha and cedar flavors. Not an ager—drink by 2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The Cabernet is the best of the Girly Girl wines. This herbal, honest and no-frills Cabernet would be perfectly fine served alongside a grilled flank steak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Shy at first on the nose, this youthful beauty is defined by richness and robust body, the tannins firm and well-integrated. Woody and herbal, it shows classic varietal character, with currant and clove flavors and an Old World flair of dusty chalk and chocolate notes. It's persistent, pleasant and complex."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a well-crafted wine that's dense and delicious in juicy red fruit, black currant, licorice and nutmeg. With much of the fruit sourced from the Alexander Valley, this wine shows a managed level of ripeness and oak aging. Structured and lengthy on the finish, this is a nicely put-together package."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine offers some remarkable value for the quality, from a good appellation to boot. Plum and cassis form around smoothly layered tannins and subtle oak, finishing in a seductive wave of black pepper and graphite."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Ripe, opulent black currants and violets, melted into liquid and bathed in toasty oak, are the flavors of this 100% Cabernet. Alcohol brings subtle heat and sweet glycerine, but the finish is dry and long. It's a beautiful evocation of St. Helena terroir, but needs aging. Give it a try in 2018, and it should have no trouble gliding well into the 2020s."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"At the age of four-plus years, this Cab still tastes young and fresh, as though it were bottled yesterday. Brims with ripe blackberries, cherries, cocoa and cedar, with a nice cut of acidity and ultrarefined tannins. Not quite ready for prime time, so give it 3–5 years to mellow."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Way too sweet in ripe, jammy cherry-berry fruit and caramelized oak, resulting in a Cabernet that tastes like the wine equivalent of a granola candy bar. Fans of this sweet style will like it."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is lighter in style, but nicely dry, balanced, appetizing and complete. It smells like red cherries and cranberries and tastes fresh, nicely tart and lively. At the same time it feels firmly tannic and palate-cleansing. This will be a super-versatile wine with food."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine blends in Petit Verdot, Petite Sirah and Malbec, reining in the bold, tart red fruit to create a medium-bodied, softly textured palate with a leathery backbone. Clove notes are followed by a chocolate chaser on the lingering finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A good, rugged, everyday wine, sugary sweet and soft in the way of some superripe Cabernets but very rich in raspberry and cocoa flavor. The curious spelling of the vineyard designation on the label is hard to explain."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Raisin and berry aromas set up a medium-bodied palate. Herbal, lightly green-berry flavors revert to raisiny and leafy on a lively but middle of the road finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Slightly herbal and leafy on the first pass, but airing shows a good mix of olive, creamy blackberry fruit and buttery oak. The flavor profile brings candied cherry/berry fruit and an herbal touch, and the finish is juicy and feels right. Standard but more than respectable at this price point."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Simultaneously sweet and smoky aromas from the use of new oak mark this full-bodied wine. The fruit flavors resemble blackberry, the texture is broad and grippy with tannins and the finish is powerful with more oak sensations."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Beautiful from start to finish, but tannic, and not drinkable now, in the classic sense. The tannins are hard, and while they're very finely ground, they prevent the palate from full appreciation of the lush blackberries, black cherries, dark chocolate and herbs. Give this 100% Cabernet at least five years to begin to mellow."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"When it comes to sheer deliciousness, this wine nails it. Comprised of 99% Cabernet Sauvig-non, with just a drop of Petit Verdot, it offers wave after- heady wave of black currants and blackberry jam. What truly distinguishes the wine is the overall balance. The tannins are beautiful, the acidity fine and the oak perfectly integrated."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There are pleasant green elements on the nose, and it's light and racy on the palate, with pepper and blackberry flavors, before the mouth-drying tannins arrive. An affordable yet bold Cabernet."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is an upscale Cabernet, rich in black currants, mocha and oak, and framed in sturdy tannins. Shows lots of class despite the statewide California appellation."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Black cherry, mocha and pepper lead on this easy-drinking red from Chaddsford. On the palate, soft cherry fruit, cedar spice and chocolate give the wine a luscious edge. Pair with Mexican mole, spiced ribs or pasta."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Good price for a Cab this succulent. Shows lots of rich, upfront blackberry jam and cassis flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. A touch of oak adds a pleasant jacket of smoky-sweet char."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tough and tannic now, although it's fully dry, and the tannins are finely sculpted. Shows deep flavors of blackberries, currants, cocoa and spices. There's a hint of funkiness that may detract from ageability."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Brambly berry fruit, with a hint of herb around the edges, marks this wine. Along with the Cabernet, there are smaller amounts of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, showing well-integrated barrel notes of coffee and roasted walnuts, and smooth tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Foresty and dark on the bouquet, with aromas of licorice, prune, forest and foxiness. The palate is full and tannic, while flavors run sweet, creamy and slightly syrupy, with chocolate and spiced fig notes. Finishes rich and rough, with dry herbs and true Chilean Cab flavors of olive and oregano."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Cabernet Sauvignon shows a dark fruit aroma, with an herbal note at the back. It has a smooth texture and medium intensity, and it would stand up to pork or roast turkey and gravy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced from one of Washington's most iconic vineyards, is aromatically appealing with barrel notes of toast, chocolate, and spice alongside earth and dark cherry. It's wound up at present with tart acids and tightly coiled tannins, showing impeccable restraint and elegance."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft and dusty, this is an herbal, elegant Cabernet from big mountain fruit, the tannins well-managed. It starts out with an intensity of black fruit followed by sturdy structure and a finish of chocolate and coffee."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is an authoritative Red Mountain Cabernet, from a rising star with an excellent young vineyard. Great structure and a spine of steel support a tightly-wound core of pure cassis. The tannins are hard but fully ripe, with black olive, coffee grounds and bourbon barrel highlights."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Shows a great return to form over the 2006, with the lush flavors and rich attractions of the 2005. With soft but complex tannins, the wine immediately appeals for its wealth of blackberries, black currants and plums, enriched with smoky oak. Very rich, pure and refined. Fine now, with a good decant, and should age well for a decade."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Generous in toasty oak aromas this Cab is otherwise rich in tar and black jam, its flavors muted by the overwhelming taste of wood."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Juicy black cherry and grippy oak are the stars of the show in this delicious red wine, softened by the addition of 16% Malbec. Elongated tannins support the leathery texture as highlights of cedar and sage play on."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This medium-bodied wine is high-toned in red fruit and tannin, a mix of cedar, black currant and blackberry that broods in the French wood it spent almost two years resting within, 60% of it new. Small percentages of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc are in the blend."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Coming from the winery's estate vineyard high up in Upper Mill Creek, this wine is starting to show a bit of age, offering aromas of anise, dried cherry, green pepper and cigar ash. Equal parts dark and green, the flavors come off a bit disjointed, with bell-pepper notes on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Reticent aromas of herbs, cherry, barrel spice and green pepper lead to elegant, soft-feeling cherry and dark chocolate flavors backed by grainy tannins. It's a very pretty expression of the variety."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This light to medium weight Cabernet has the right profile, but just doesn't seem to come alive. The nose shows blackberry and tobacco aromas and in the mouth there are dried black cherry and spice notes, but they never shine. A soflty dry, slightly woody finish closes the package."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This engages the taste buds with bright, ripe fruit flavors and balances them with good crisp acidity and light tannins, plus spicy oak accents that resemble vanilla, allspice and nutmeg. Medium to full bodied, it feels smooth in the mouth but the lip-smacking tannins carry through on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is really a nice Cabernet Sauvignon. Soft and polished, it shows herb and cassis flavors, wrapped in rich smoky oak, with a long, dry finish. The tannins are quite strong now, giving the wine a chewy toughness and suggesting moderate aging. Hold until after 2008."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Blackberry, cigar box, vanilla bean and black-licorice aromas are out front, with savory herbs in the background, becoming more prominent over time. The dark-fruit flavors are elegant in style and linger on the smoky finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vanilla, green wood and dark fruit aromas lead to sweet black currant and baking spice flavors. The wood is somewhat prominent at times but it still provides a lot of appeal."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Raw and harsh, with green, unripe tannins framing simple berry jam flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A healthy 20% of Merlot provides additional softness in this food-friendly, well-integrated wine, bright in crisp cranberry and mellowed oak and tannin. Well-made at a fair price, it's well worth the seek."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Marked by excessive oak, with toasty-sweet caramel flavors dominating the ripe blackberry and cherry pie flavors. Nice tannins, though. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Considering the price of some Oakville Cabs, this one's a value. It's quite a good wine, rich and tannic and oaky and ripe, offering appealing blackberry, black cherry, black currant and smoky oak flavors that finish dry and spicy. Should develop over the next 3–5 years, although it seems to lack the stuffing for the long haul."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A very nice Cabernet from a winery that's done a good job with this vineyard bottling for many years. The wine is smooth as velvet, with soft, lush tannins and opulent blackberry, currant, dark chocolate and cedar flavors. It should develop in the bottle over the next 6–8 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Smoky and dusty on the palate, this wine is soft and approachable, but also full bodied and ripe. It offers thick layers of chocolate mocha and vanilla."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A 100% varietal, this represents a tiny offering of this single-vineyard wine. Despite its youth it is silky and supple on the palate. Rich, dense black fruit and graphite marry well and find cohesion among the toasty oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Velvety and plush on the palate, this classic Cabernet offers firm, youthful tannins and full-bodied concentration of dense black fruit. Cedar, dried herb and tobacco scents frame its core, broadcasting a burning intensity and sanguine chewiness. Cellar and enjoy best 2023–2033."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of tire rubber and plum lead to soft, sweet cherry and mocha flavors. It's a solid, easy drinker."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A small percentage of Petit Verdot was added to this Cab, the grapes sourced from throughout the Napa Valley. Cedar, mint and chocolate cassis come foreward on the palate, the wine slightly thin though oaky."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Here's a sound, everyday Cabernet. It's dry and full-bodied, with some good blackberry, raisin and oak flavors. A nice buy for the price."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Distant berry, plum and earthy aromas come in front of a choppy, tight palate with depth. Plum, tomato and herbal flavors finish with good structure. Overall, this La Mancha Cabernet Sauvignon is well knit, without any notable faults. Drink through 2021."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cold Creek Vineyard provides the majority of the fruit for this wine, with the rest coming from the Wahluke Slope. It's immediate in its appeal with aromas of cocoa, dark chocolate and black fruit. The coffee flavors show a mixture of fruit and barrel, with some graininess to the tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A tight, metallic streak runs vertically through this Cabernet. Deep cassis fruit, juicy acids and the mineral/metal signature of the vineyard combine in a well-structured wine with an extended finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is serious and concentrated, probably built to age a few more years before its peak. It smells soaked with black cherry and black currant aromas, tastes deep, ripe and compelling, and feels full bodied and firmly tannic. The flavors are powerful enough to match the big texture, so it should improve through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Black cherry, blueberry jam, volcanic rocks, river stones and a mace spice show on the nose of this wine. The palate is thick with black fruit and dark chocolate, the tannins showing lots of structure and flavors of purple flowers giving depth. It needs more time in the bottle to reach full potential."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A rich, satisfying Cabernet, packed with blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors, with a touch of herbs and mint. Not quite as dense or concentrated as the winery's mountain-appellated Cabs, but quite a good one."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Silky and plush, this textural harmony is one of the characters that define Margaret River Cabernets. Ample cassis and plum notes are sweet and pick up savory nuances, while subtle hints of tomato leaf and red bell pepper add complexity without being distractingly vegetal. Drink now–2030."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cedar and cigar box are most prominent on the nose, followed by hints of blackberry and currant. The palate boasts cigar box, leather and raw oak with more currant and pomegranate offering levity. Medium tannins lend structure and carry through to the cedar flecked finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cherry-berry aromas mix with a hint of vinegar and cleanser to create a sketchy, foreboding bouquet. The wine is a little blocky in the mouth, with both weedy-herbal and plum-berry flavors. Finishes with tolerable but noticeable bitterness and burn."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The grapes used for this estate-grown Cabernet are sourced from younger vines. Round and full, the wine seems to have spent a fair amount of time in barrel, showing pretty baking spices along with tangy fruit."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"With sharp acidity and pungent black currant, plum and raisin flavors, this muscular Cabernet is probably best to drink now. It's an interesting wine, with a spicy, tannic finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The Indian Wells Cabernet Sauvignon seems a little reductive at the moment; odd, since the 2005 vintage was forward, almost fat, and the wine has been in bottle for quite some time. It should definitely be decanted and aired out before serving, which will help to push the fruit flavors forward. The finish is just slightly dilute, but the wine is well-made and may just be suffering from some of the occasional dumbness that strikes Cabernet."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is nearly perfect, a massive, monumental wine whose sheer power is matched only by its grace and refinement. The flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, buttered toast and cedar flood the mouth, tightly controlled by firm tannins and good acidity. Decant for several hours if you open it now, but better to give it 6–10 years in the bottle."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Good price for a nicely complex Cabernet for drinking now. Dry and smooth in tannins, it shows ripe blackberry, cherry, licorice and herb flavors, with a kiss of oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A sweet-styled Cabernet with raisin, black cherry and baked plum aromas. The feel is clacky and unsophisticated, and the flavors blend candied currant, prune and sugar. Grabby as well."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This elegant Cabernet nicely threads the needle between fruit and herb, slaloming down the palate with a lingonberry here, a sprig of thyme there, underpinned with earth and chocolate. It's a wine that may be sipped and savored, offering subtle pleasures along the way."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"One of the appellation's more famous wines, this opens in black licorice and blackberry, alongside a streak of malted chocolate, soft and sinewy, with a tension of acidity that adds age-worthy structure. Dense and interesting now, it'll get better over time, cellaring well through 2027."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is slightly bigger and bolder than the 2009 Art Series Cabernet, but remains a relatively streamlined and silky rendering of the variety. Potent cedar and vanilla notes frame dark fruit aromas and flavors, while the finish lingers, echoing with wood overtones. Drink now–2025."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a soft, sweet, almost Porty wine, with raisin, chocolate and blackberry flavors. It has a long, spicy finish, and is best now with lusty stews and barbecue."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Baking spice, vanilla, dill and cherry aromas lead to a mixture of barrel and fruit flavors, with the oak tannins bringing a sense of astringency."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A lot of Chilean Cabernets seem to have a distinct weediness to them; this is a perfect example of the style, boasting green hay and herb aromas over subdued—almost stewed—cassis fruit. Some tart acidity keeps things lively on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Packed in upfront, with some atypical grassy, wildflower aromas. Chunky fruit and Port-like flavors make a statement, as does a black-tea note on the finish. Slightly clumsy now, the hope here is that some time in the cellar will help weld any incongruent elements."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This solidly made wine is well apportioned in terms of price and quality. With smokiness to the toasty oak, it's a concentrated and juicy wine accented by saddle and black cherry. Medium bodied and rounded, it has a medium finish, as well."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"While this wine is less expensive than some of Corley Family's other Cabernets, it's beautiful. Blended with one-quarter Cabernet Franc, it's softly tannic, acidic and rich in black cherries, black and red currants and smoky sandalwood. Drink this flashy wine through 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This smooth, almost soft, medium-bodied wine features tasty blackberry flavors, light tannins and a nice feeling of richness. It has a lot of flavor and an easy-drinking style."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Ripe, rich and elegant, this wine is brimming with black plum, strawberry, cassis, chocolate, spice and herb notes. It's smooth-textured and seamlessly integrated, even at this early stage. Firm, plush tannins and just the right amount of toasty oak frame the ensemble."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Jigar makes Cabernets to drink now, and this accomplishes that intent. The wine is firmly tannic, with jammy flavors of blackberries and cherries and the herbaceousness that Alexander Valley Cabs so often show."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Green, grassy aromas lead the bouquet, which then turns charred and oaky. In the mouth, clove and heavy oak notes are dominant, while the feel is rubbery and rough. This is rugged and oaky."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The weather-wracked vintage of 2011 affected this sometimes stunning bottling, presenting bell pepper greenness with a hint of black earth. It's thin on the palate, which leans toward the greener side of the Cab spectrum, but remains very drinkable with cherry cola and mocha flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A solid wine for the price, this often sells for less than suggested retail in grocery stores. This bottling shows bacon fat, tart blackberry, black loam and baked goods on a just-enough-of-everything nose. The soft palate is smooth, with mouth-coating tannins and flavors of cigar leaf, black currant and black pepper."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Cabernet Sauvignon's vanilla, baking spice, dill, herb and cherry aromas are locked up. The palate brings plenty of vanilla flavors backed by gritty tannins, but the oak is too prominent and distracting."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"So delicious now, you can drink it, but the hard tannins strongly suggest aging this beauty. Beyond the astringency are complex flavors of blackberries and olives, with sweet toasty oak playing a starring role. Harder to describe is the overall balance, so rich and sweet, yet dry and elusive. Give it until 2020 to begin to come around."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dark ruby in color, this wine has a bouquet of black cherry, green pepper and pomegranate. Smooth tannins provide a backdrop for flavors of black cherry, cranberry, smoke and Mediterranean herbs that recede slightly on the bright cherry finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine offers a tight nose of cherry cola and petrol. It opens on the palate by featuring flavors of smoked meat, eucalyptus, cherry, and ripe peach. Lush tannins contribute a fatty umami sensation to the palate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a good, traditional-style wine with aromas like sage and plums. Flavors are fruity but accented by herbs, with a texture that is mild in tannins and relatively soft."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tastes more like a Zinfandel, with peppery flavors of wild blackberries and briary mulberries, edged with tobacco and balsam. Tannic, too, with a rough mouthfeel. Doesn't seem like an ager."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Full bodied and richly textured, this is an approachable wine that should nonetheless drink well through at least 2025. Toasted coconut accents cassis and blackberry fruit, folding in hints of vanilla on the long, mouthwatering finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Very rich in blackberries and cassis, almost sweet, and the oak adds to the impression of sweetness with smoky caramel. Almost chocolaty, with a minty tang. Definitely in the modern style, soft and flashy. We'll see if it ages."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Coming from the cool 2010 vintage, this wine seems a bit overwrought, with aromas of stewed herbs and cherry. The flavors are full bodied, backed by chewy tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lightly herbal and slightly earthy aromas meet fresh, ripe berry flavors in this medium-bodied wine. It's smooth and soft in texture, low in tannins, and easy to enjoy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Bold flavors and a muscular structure make this wine stand out, delivering plenty of substance for its modest price. Smoky, peppery aromas lead to dark fruit flavors with smoky, spicy accents, while the body is medium and texture firmly tannic."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a shockingly low price for anything from Rutherford, let alone Cabernet Sauvignon, but sometimes why ask why? Dusty and powerful, it's well balanced in acidity and black fruit, finishing in leather and dark chocolate bound by leather."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From the producer's monumental Atlas Peak vineyard, this is a tightly wound, solidly constructed mountain Cab, blended with a handful of Petit Verdot. Tobacco, black tea and a sliver of coconut intermingle around a medium-bodied whole that will benefit from cellaring, through 2021."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a solid, well-priced and widely available wine. Deep in color, it offers sultry blackberry jam, cocoa and coffee aromas. Soft tannins coat the palate, bringing tart cherry and woody spice flavors. The acidity and grip are just right."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From certified organic grapes, this light-styled wine is bittersweet in tobacco leaf, leather and black pepper, subdued in its approach to fruit. Toasted oak plays a subtle counterpart, integrated and very much in the background."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Char, clove and rubber aromas dominate what's otherwise leafy and herbal. A tight, hard-tannin palate features peppery, bitter flavors of black fruits in front of a pinched, narrow-feeling finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This certified organic and biodynamic wine has no sulfites added. It offers deep color plus bold black cherry and smoke aromas. Rich but dry flavors are both fruity and meaty, while a high level of fine tannins make it firm and almost chewy in texture. Not quite full bodied, it feels well balanced despite the intensity. Drink now through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a big, mouthfilling Cabernet, rich and voluptuous in fruit. Although it's a bit hot in alcohol, you hardly notice it, with the explosion of blackberries, raisins and chocolate-covered cherries, made even richer by smoky-sweet oak. Delicious now and through 2014."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Thick, like blueberry syrup, this is a soft, layered wine with notions of vanilla, toasted oak and spearmint that confound on the palate. A substantial, concentrated wine, it finishes in mocha chocolate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This high-end Cab is named after a deceased winery employee who would be pleased to have such a distinguished wine in his memory. It's very powerful and tannic and needs age, but it's also exceptionally balanced. Showing ripe red and black currant flavors that have been generously oaked, it's a gorgeous young Napa Valley Cab that should develop through 2014."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon from older vines, the Cold Creek bottling often begins life rather compact, even hard, and will usually benefit from some years of bottle age. This 2005 is a tough, somewhat stemmy wine, with tightly wound black fruits, herbs and leather wrapped into its core. Tannic and unyielding, even after some hours of breathing time, it is a bit too soon to know exactly how good it will ultimately become."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"With its big, hard tannins, this is one for the cellar. There's a certain austerity that suggests the rocky soils of this mountain vineyard. But the fruit, packed into a dense core, is ripe and suggestive of blackberry and cherries. The youthful brawniness softens after some time in the glass or decanter, but you're best off aging it until 2019 or so."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of tire rubber, plum and spice are followed sweet currant and cranberry flavors. The tannins bring some grit."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This smooth, lean red attractively delivers above its price point. Tart in clove and currant, it finishes with a whiplash of mocha."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The 2004 vintage favored Cabernet, and that quality has evidently trickled down to this bargain from Penfolds. Hints of brown sugar and raisin on the nose give an impression of great ripeness, but that's balanced by fresh black currant, coffee and black olive flavors. Tannins are supple, but finish on a slightly dusty note, giving the wine enough backbone to pair with steak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine brings aromas of caramel, blue fruit, barrel spice and herb that are followed by elegantly styled fruit flavors and gritty tannins, with a light bitter note that distracts."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft, smooth and delicious, this offers a beautiful example of the modern cult style of flashy drinkability. It tastes expensive, with refined tannins and ripe blackberry, cassis and oak flavors. This could be an ager. From Laura Zahtila."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a true pan-Washington Cabernet, with fruit coming from 12 different vineyards scattered across the Columbia Valley. It's 100% varietal as aromas of char, toast, black cherry meats, herb, cranberry and spice are followed by elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of heft and grip."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This co-mingling holds 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Petit Verdot. Juicy blackberry and cassis make up the wine's fruit component, accompanied by solid structure and tannins, and an unusual sprinkling of coconut macaroon."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This densely flavored and full-bodied wine has a very deep, dark color and aromas that suggest oak barrels, nutmeg and cardamom. The palate shows tension between firm tannins and acidity, and carries ripe blackberries, with spicy accents. Drink now through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine is soft and velvety, awash in classic notes of black currant and berry, textured in full-bodied, oaky waves of toast and cigar box. Approachable on the palate, it winds its way powerfully though softly from start to lengthy finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Coming from a vineyard first planted by Mondavi in the late 1990s, this well-priced and widely available wine shows blackberry, violets, black pepper and just snapped dark chocolate on the nose. Fresh, lively black cherries and blueberries meld with fennel, tarragon and lots of herbal spice, all held together by smooth tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a very dry and dusty wine. That experience starts on the nose, where dried oregano, pencil shavings and bittersweet-chocolate aromas meet with restrained blackberry juice. The herbal wave carries into the sip, with marjoram, bay leaf and dill playing into slightly sour black-plum fruit."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Known more for Zinfandel and Rhône blends, Bill Easton has quietly been making Cabernet as well for many years. This vintage is earthy and leathery, reminiscent of his Syrah-based wines, yet rich in savory black cherry, cedar and black olive. Built to age, put it away until 2019–2024 and the savory, herbal elements are sure to develop further."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine is brightly aromatic, with raspberry, mint, herb and woodspice notes. The palate is full of plush, plump fruit flavors that provide appeal, despite the prominent alcohol."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This engages the taste buds with bright, ripe fruit flavors and balances them with good crisp acidity and light tannins, plus spicy oak accents that resemble vanilla, allspice and nutmeg. Medium to full bodied, it feels smooth in the mouth but the lip-smacking tannins carry through on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Fresh, fruity and charming, this rosé offers full-bodied flavors of strawberry and spice that are balanced and complex. A step above the typical flirty rosé, the wine gives style and substance and will handle heartier dishes—think Moroccan tagine or grilled, spiced fish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Medicinal black cherry aromas turn heavier and more prune-like with air. The palate is reasonably solid and healthy in feel, but monotonous and devoid of layering. Tastes tangy, zesty and mostly clean, with slightly baked flavors and a spot of heat."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A block selection from Frediani Vineyard, this offers smoky soy flavors around a thick concentration of chocolate and blackberry tart, the texture generously ripe. There's a bitterness of clove and black currant on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rich, thick and jammy sweet, this Cab tasted a bit juvenile in the winter of 2009. With blackberry and cherry pie filling, chocolate, licorice and pepper flavors, it might develop harmony over the next six years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Smells like wet clay with an accent of floral black fruit. In the mouth, it's edgy and sharp, with rock-hard tannins that clamp down. Tastes lactic but not creamy, with sharp red-fruit flavors and a hard finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"D'Arenberg's Coppermine Cabernets are often tannic and austere upon release, so be warned should you decide to open one in the next year or two. The aromas and flavors are classic this year, seamlessly marrying cassis and cedar, but finishing dry, astringent and firm. Drink 2020–2030+."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"With the addition of 15% Syrah, this is a meaty wine, compact in red fruit, leather and clove. Integrated oak girds a soft tannic structure that's approachable and easy to please."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Solid and elegant, this standard-bearer offers round, plummy aromas and flavors, as well as cocoa and tobacco accents. The fruit is very clean and bright, and the flavors well defined on the lush, well-balanced palate. Finishes dark and juicy, with fine tannins. This wine should improve over the next three to five years, and then drink well until 2008."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Fresh and zesty on the nose, this bottling shows dried elderberry fruit laced with oregano, thyme, dill, eucalyptus and black pepper. A strong tobacco flavor shows once sipped, with black-cherry fruit, cedary cigar box and sticky tannins contributing to a leathery mouthfeel."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Blue and red-fruit aromas lead to lightly styled cherry flavors. Herb accents run throughout.
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From a 2,400-foot elevation vineyard, this wine is unexpectedly elegant and definitively age-worthy. Floral and unusual, the palate brings integrated tannins wrapped around a core of ripe blackberry and cassis. Structured, it has plenty of body and length, bringing an old world sensibility to new world fruit. Drink now through 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Concentrated blackberry, currant and vanilla flavors ride a boldly ripe, full-bodied palate that reflects the warmth and intensity of the vintage. Dusty tannin and softened oak allow the fruit to speak, accented by black licorice."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Entirely from Mario's Vineyard grapes, this opens in burly black pepper and cigar box, a powerfully concentrated expression of the variety that's big in persistent tannin and oak, yielding a dry dustiness on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Minty and leafy, with fading fruit. The wine is still firm, the finish a bit sharp, but this wine isn't going to get any better than it is now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Baked loamy berry aromas come with a reedy rooty note of licorice. This feels good but jammy and a touch flat. Jammy raspberry, plum and currant flavors finish spicy and lightly herbal. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Returning to traditional fruit sources (Seven Hills and Pepper Bridge) after the freeze year of 2004, winemaker JF Pellet has crafted the finest Pepper Bridge Cabernet to date. Gorgeous aromas explode from the glass, a lush mix of flower, berry, mocha and sweet earth. Smooth and silky on the tongue, it's a riot of berry and cassis flavor, all in proportion and moving gracefully across the palate and into a round, detailed finish with whiffs of smoke, caramel and coffee grounds."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Discovery Vineyard Cab makes up most of this wine, with just a splash of Champoux vineyard Franc to fill it out. Very pretty, very focused aromas of spice box, red and black fruit and herb are followed by a fruit-forward, shamelessly appealing yet still elegant, balanced palate that puts a premium on purity, with a well integrated structure surrounding it all."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dusty mocha scents meet cedar and herb in this dense, full-bodied wine. Spicy acidity keeps it fresh on the palate, with a zing of clove, cinnamon and black pepper."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A little rustic and sharp, but perfectly okay if you're looking for an everyday Cab to elevate simple fare. It shows black currant and oak flavors, and is thoroughly dry."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A Western Australia offshoot of the Yalumba empire, Ringbolt's 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon offers solid quality at a reasonable price. It's medium-bodied and elegant, with prominent herbal notes balanced by cassis and chocolate. Long on the finish, where dried spice and vanilla notes emerge. Drink now–2012."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Alluringly seductive aromas of black cherry syrup, blueberry pie, blackberry preserves and fresh-cracked black pepper draw the nose into this blend of Lone Oak and Valley View vineyards, located 800 to 1,000 feet in elevation. Flavors of blackberry-chocolate liqueur, plums and black cherries are elevated by pine sap, rosemary and strong tannins that maintain perfect grip. Serve with lamb."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tasty and smooth, this Cabernet Sauvignon includes 11% each Merlot and Syrah, and was aged in 100% Taransaud oak barrels. The fruit is ripe and pretty, the barrels bringing in plenty of lush, toasty accents. Drink now or over the next 5–6 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a serious and substantial Cabernet, using grapes sourced primarily from the Phinney Hill Vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills. Muscular and loaded with purple fruits and cassis, it is thickly woven into a bed of earth and herb. The wine is graceful and balanced, with exceptional depth and detail; however, it leans heavily on the herbal side of the grape."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of cherry, raspberry and buttered toast set the scene for a wine whose flavors of Bing cherry, custard, clove and fennel are bright on entry before pleasantly washing across the side palate. Unified fruit and spice flavors endure on the taste buds into the smooth, drawn out finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Brawny, with an explosive concentration of blackberry, this intense wine offers hints of tobacco, smoked meat and black licorice elevated on the palate. Blended with small amounts of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, it finishes on a bittersweet note and with some black pepper. Cellar through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Ripe blackberry meets with rustic leather and a bit of rubbery funk on this nose of this wine made by the Riboli family of Los Angeles' San Antonio Winery. It's rich and jammy with tannins adding balance, but not much acidity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The winery continues to try to figure out how to grow Cabernet in this remote part of the county. Ripeness isn't the problem. Structure is. The flavors are upfront in blackberries, cherries and currants, but complexity and dryness remain challenges."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From a highly sought-after vineyard site, this wine is intense in tannin and weight, making the fruit work to express itself. Red berry and cherry are given additional richness by a taste of coconut macaroon, with a mellowed finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"One of the most pleasurable Clos du Bois Cabernets in years, this is easy to enjoy now for its flavors of cherries, currants, tobacco, spices and smoky oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Complex and compelling in dark plum and dusty dark chocolate, this Cabernet has under 3% Petit Verdot and under 3% Cabernet Franc blended in, providing the wine with elegance and concentration. Soft on the palate, it suggests vanilla oak with subtlety, bringing all the components together on the lingering finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Very solid and deep, with a bouquet of delicious black-currant and dark-cherry fruit and toasty, buttery oak. Very comfortable mouthfeel. Full, with layered fruit and a long and elegant finish that sports big but not sharp tannins. Tight now; hold for three to six years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A deep red color and concentrated aromas and flavors of dark berries, dark chocolate and pomegranate are offset nicely by a layered texture laced with fine tannins. This well-structured wine will be great with a juicy steak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced mostly from Pepper Bridge and Spofford Station. It has steely aromatics, showing rock and tight, tart red currant flavors. In the Waters style this is another elegant wine, that conceals its discreet pleasures in its layered aromas and mixed fruit and rock flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The dominant dark-cherry aroma smells bitter and high pitched. The palate feels supple and medium bodied, and it tastes a touch confected, like blackberry jelly used to fill donuts."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A rustic, 100% varietal wine from Corbett vineyard, Leo is soft and approachable. It's a wine to please a range of palates in its lushness of blueberry and black licorice."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Slightly shy dark fruit, spice and gravel aromas show on the nose of this affordably priced bottling. Cranberry, dried herb and mineral flavors are apparent on the palate, which finishes on a fruit punch note."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Plums, purple flowers and graphite characterize the nose on this wine from the producer that's now owned by the Foley family of wines. Spicy cherries and blackberries show on the palate long with pencil lead and hints of dried oregano."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The nose is an attractive mix of cassis and mineral notes. The palate is more racy and wiry than dense and soft, with juicy, flashy flavors of berry, cherry and currant. Those notes all carry through to the long finish; drink from 2013–2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Classic Margaret River Cabernet, showing great balance between cedary oakiness and effusive fruitiness. Cola and plum notes give this a darker flavor spectrum than some vintages, yet the flavors remain crisp and vibrant, ending with soft tannins. Drink now–2025."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's a spicy quality to the aroma of this polished Cab, with suggestions of dill, sage, crushed autumn leaves and even Provençal lavender and thyme. It's a unique interpretation of Napa and must come from the vineyard's terroir. In the mouth, notes of herbs and tobacco lead to more savory sweet cherry, currant and vanilla oak flavors. This interesting, even dramatic Cab should develop over the next decade."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Fuse's Cabernet has been better in the past, when the vintages were warmer. This '11, from the coldest vintage in years, is a hard wine to embrace. It's very dry and somewhat sharp, with bell pepper-infused blackberry and olive flavors. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Here's a good example of what's so disturbing about the rash of expensive Cabernets and blends that has possessed the minds of consumers. This is an awkward, cumbersome wine. Sure, the fruit is as ripe as anything on earth, but what good is extract if it doesn't have balance? The wine is excessively soft. It's cloying, and to add insult to injury, it's tannic. There are wines that cost one-fifth the price that are far better."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Smoky pepper marks the aroma of this soft, smooth and balanced Cabernet Sauvignon that conveys plenty of refined power. Clove and dried herb provide a savory edge to the experience, which remains integrated and polished in the glass, finishing with a sense of finesse."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The palate is drenched in sweet oak and sugarplums. This is not to say that it is a syrupy quaff: there is also cocoa, toast, dried herbs and a note of eucalyptus that pinches at the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of golden raisins, fig, licorice and vanilla lead to full-feeling dark-fruit flavors, with the tannins bringing a sense of grittiness. Time might smooth things, but the aromas already seem a bit dried out."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Hints of coffee and cedar add complexity to ripe, luscious black-fruit flavors on this very well made Romanian Cabernet. It's delightfully fruit forward, but amplified with a hefty mouthfeel and penetrating tannins on the finish. A bargain at $7."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine opens with big, full-bodied and extracted flavors, highlighted by black cherry, smoked meat and clove. Blended with 4% Merlot, it exudes textural complexity and velvety lushness, with length and breadth to spare. Within its fountain of power exists a strong sense of grace, accented by aromas of wild violet and forested earth."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Opens with light but earthy raspberry aromas and plum, and then it breaks up a bit with airing. The palate is lean but fresh and gritty, with cherry and cola flavors in front of a limited, narrow finish. Run-of-the-mill, which isn't bad given the price."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Herbal and juicy, this is a straightforward, larger-production wine with a grip of tannins supporting waves of coconut and red and black berry. It's well priced for the quality and is a good choice for everyday enjoyment."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There are solid Cabernet flavors of blackberries and black currants in this dry, tannic wine. It's rough and astringent in the mouth, without much charm, but a rich steak, maybe topped with a gorgonzola sauce, will make it shine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of matchstick, herb, vanilla and cinnamon are followed by a creamy-feeling palate that equally mixes fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins seem a bit bunched up."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a dense yet dry wine, with a ripe blackberry jam aroma and flavor. Firm tannins give it pleasant grip; splashing it into a decanter will open it up."
Cabernet Sauvignon,This smells confected—neither natural nor convincing. Vanilla and milk chocolate aromas recall a cheap ice cream sundae. This feels scattered and hollow. Plum and chocolate flavors taste artificial and forced.
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Highlighted in Rainier cherry and cassis fruit, with a core of high acidity, this is a drinkable, affordable red wine worth looking for."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a bit thin, and mixes in a strong herbal dimension with the tart red fruit. The acids are proportionate, and the tannins carry some bitterness into the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The Art Series Cabernet seems to be increasing in quality nearly every vintage. The 2012 boasts plenty of sweet, cedary oak, but backs that up with layers of red currant fruit and hints of bay leaf. It's silky and harmonious on the finish, adding tea-like notes of complexity. Drink now–2025."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A new project from winemakers Mark McNeilly and Trey Busch, this wine leads with aromas of fresh green herbs, raspberries, dark chocolate and cherry. The palate is full bore but not overweighted, showing intensity to the red and black fruit flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Cab opens with mellow, woody aromas on top of cassis and berry scents. The palate is a bit choppy and drying, but there's good structure to it along with attractive flavors of moss, earth, baked berry and light herbs."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Damp earth, tar and gamy bacon combine aromatically and flavor-wise in this Cabernet, which also contains smaller traces of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Black currant and cassis mingle with an herbal back beat that begins to power up midway through and on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Intense ripeness opens this wine, followed by a rustic note of leather and horsehide. Puckering tannins show off the oak before a glimpse of blackberry and black currant fight for existence."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Marked by sweet, jammy fruit and oak, this wine is quite good, but doesn't show much complexity. It's smooth and silky, with pie-filling flavors of blackberries, raspberries and cherries, wrapped into firm but fine tannins. Could develop bottle complexity down the road, but it's a gamble."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lots of flashy blackberry and cassis flavors in this Cabernet. Easy to drink, but feels way too soft to earn a higher score. Drink up."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a sweeter and fruity take on the grape, beginning with a nose of fresh and vibrant boysenberry fruit and wet-asphalt minerality. The palate is tasty in a hedonistic way, but very primary, with flavors of fruit punch."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Densely packed with black fruit and barrel toast, this wine is mouth-puckering with tannin and power. A lightly perceptible dried herb note weaves through its dark texture."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The bouquet kicks up hints of graham cracker, iodine and earth. The mouth is fat and broad, with a goodly amount of typical plum and cherry flavors. The finish is simple yet clean, with tight tannins and moderate length. Good and well made; a wine for everyday consumption."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Muted aromatically at first, pushing to impart rose, sage and violet, this red offers an edginess of tobacco leaf and peppery meat. Structured acidity provides appreciated support and a contrast to medium-sized tannin."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This expertly woven wine proves very cohesive and well balanced, despite its intent to compete with the bigger, often richer wines of the luxury category. Blueberry and blackberry aromas meet with charred wood, graphite and chocolate on the elegant nose. The ripe berry flavors are wrapped in cocoa and light cedar spice, laced together with buoyant acidity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Floral and lush, this majority Cabernet Sauvignon contains 10% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot, combining for a structured, layered wine accented in black cherry, cedar and dried herb. From vineyards strewn across the Napa Valley, including mountainside sites, it offers power and finesse and should sit well in cellar through 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Defines the Pride Cabernet style of big, rich, ripely extracted fruit, significant oak and dense mountain tannins. Harder to describe is just how dramatic the wine feels in the mouth. Offers black currant, cassis liqueur and dark chocolate flavors subtlely tinged with herbs and tannins. May not have the stuffing for the very long haul, but great over the next six years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Starts off with a hint of vinyl on the nose, layered atop sour cherry and vanilla flavors. The slightly syrupy texture is offset by tangy acids on the finish. Imported by Walca International."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Pleasant richness and depth of fruit flavor accompany the deep color and nicely chewy tannins in this full-bodied Cabernet. It tastes dry and well balanced between acidity, tannins and fruitiness, and will be a great mealtime wine with all kinds of protein."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tight, grippy tannin complements sharp acidity in this youthful wine from a rich vintage and mountainous appellation. Rich, red fruit yields to more savory currant aspects, dusted in clove spice and rooted in full-bodied weightiness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of baking spice, orange peel and green herb are followed by well-balanced fruit and savory flavors. There's no mistaking the variety or the region that it comes from. It's a distinctive wine but not for all tastes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cowaramup is a Margaret River subregion. A herbal note adds interest to the aromas, and some lifted red fruit sets this wine apart from Cherubino's other 2010 Cabernets. Otherwise, it's pretty similar in its lavish oaking and meaty, savory flavors, but with a bright, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"High-toned and sharp, this Cabernet features sleek berry and cassis fruit. On the palate it feels both slightly hot and acidic; it needs decanting. If you like some spice and plenty of new oak, this is a good choice."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Opens with hard, tight, rubbery aromas of black cherry and blackberry. The palate is deep and tannic, with a vise-like grip and dark, herbal flavors of cassis, plum and berry. The finish, not surprisingly, maintains the wine's dark, rubbery, pushy character."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A handful of vineyards and additions of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot make up the whole of this wine, a cool-climate style accented in spicy red currant, cherry and woody tannin. With an earthiness of compost and wood, it shows a touch of reduction as it finishes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This classy Cabernet marks a high point for Salentein. On the nose, it's redolent of oak grain, tobacco, vanilla and all sorts of berry fruits. The palate is full, ripe and solid as an ox. Spiced berry, tobacco and cedary flavors finish dry, sturdy and lightly herbal. Drink through 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rubbery, herbal initial aromas yield to black-fruit and earthy qualities as this breathes and unwinds. The palate has a healthy, forward mouthfeel and flavors of herbal berry and cassis. A dry, rooty-tasting finish is spicy in flavor and medium in length and complexity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From small-batch, handcraft producer Stark-Condé, this unfiltered Cab offers personality and elegance. Berry, herbs, fennel and spice on the nose lead into a red that's extremely pretty in the mouth. Good integration of tannins and fruit, and a light minerality throughout give the wine a soft, balanced appeal. Though it will pair well with spiced meat and bolder dishes, the wine is great on its own."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Plush yet structured tannins and juicy, easygoing cassis and cranberry flavors allow this wine to sing. Deeper black fruit touches complement the brightness, adding power and concentration."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Very fruity, with tons of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa folded into soft tannins. A bit simple, but a nice everyday sipper."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A nice Cabernet, proper and pleasant, it tastes of blackcurrants and oak and is very dry and balanced. No doubting that it comes from a good vineyard and has been made in a competent style."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Far from a fruit bomb, this is an elegant Cabernet with modest but complex currant, black cherry, cola and herb flavors. The tannins are considerable, and so is the acidity. Drink now after decanting for several hours, or allow it to develop over the next eight years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Quilceda Creek's Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon opens with a dense, exotic and luxurious nose: a mix of roasted coffee, dark fruit and Asian spice. At first it's quite dense and unyielding, but it opens slowly over a period of days—not hours—remaining dense and compact, with a remarkable array of dark fruits and barrel flavors. As with its companion reds from Quilceda Creek, this is a wine to cellar for decades."
Cabernet Sauvignon,A touch of vanilla and sweet oak graces the brambly black berry aromas and flavors in this wine. Medium weight and round in the mouth with fine tannins and a lively finish. Drink now.
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sweet, soft tannins inform the entry to this 100% varietal wine, a decadent exploration of dark chocolate and graham cracker. Powerful and intense, it smoothes out as it opens, revealing plush layers of blackberry and plum."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine sources fruit from throughout Napa Valley, as well as 9% from Lake County and 1% from the Sierra Foothills, incorporating all five red Bordeaux varieties and a smidgen of Syrah. It's juicy in black currant, with a tension of acidity and a smooth, simple focus, aged in both French and American oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dark-fruit aromas are fairly oaky, and thus there's a hint of cinnamon to the nose. Fresh, angular and raw on the palate, this tastes of herbal plum and spice, with a touch of green olive. On the back side, olive and mint flavors accent plum and berry leftovers."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The oak (40% new French and American) is up front, with aromas of barrel spices, cocoa and generous amounts of vanilla followed by cherries and blue fruit. This wine is velvety in feel, displaying a mixture of fruit and barrel that carries through the finish. The oak influence is heavy but the appeal is impossible to ignore."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Very ripe and forward Cabernet, with jammy blackberry and cherry, spice and earthy flavors, as well as lots of sweet, toasty oak. It's satisfying to drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Simply a spectacular wine; a Napa prototype for fabulous Cabernet. Cassis, tobacco and cedar commingle on the nose, followed by luscious cassis fruit that's backed up by exemplary barrel notes—both in flavor and in texture. So smooth and deft, it's the epitome of class. Give it about five years in the cellar and then indulge."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Forward berry and plum aromas are pleasant on the nose. On the palate, high acid drives flavors of plum and red berry fruit to a short and clean finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A soft, fleshy wine to drink now. It has a fancy mouthfeel, with a firm hit of tannins and acidity, and lush flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola and spices."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Blended with splashes of Petit Verdot and Merlot, this Cabernet is rich, soft and smooth. The blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors are at their full, primary expression, and promise a long, evolving aging process in the years ahead."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Blueberries and purple fruits get distinct seasoning from maple syrup, licorice, crushed Italian herbs and minerality in this wine from the underappreciated Cuyama Valley. The palate is quite wound up, with blueberry, black lava rocks and unrelenting herb flavors just poking out. This will unwind very nicely, so drink 2018–2028."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A delicious Cab, polished and supple, with ripe black and red currant, raspberry, violet, cedar and mocha flavors. Feels soft and velvety in the mouth. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Smoky and meaty, this medium-bodied Cab from rocky Atlas Peak offers sensible acidity wrapped around spicy, dusty tannins and a savory aftertaste of tobacco."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is an approachable, affordable wine that impresses on every level. It combines raspberry, vanilla and plum flavors with juicy, moderate acidity and rounded texture, the fruit accented with clove, cedar and bay leaf notes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Concentrated strawberry and plum blossom aromas are boosted with iron and a touch of oak smoke on the nose of this bottling by winemaker Steve Martell. The palate shows ripe red currant, woody elderberry brush and a shred of asphalt."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"It is rare to find pure Cabernet Sauvignon in the Loire, but 2009 was the year when it worked with ripe black currant and berry fruits. The wine has a dark, dense concentration while retaining elegance and a light touch. Age for several years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A densely layered nose shows boysenberry, plum blossoms, mocha, coffee, kola nut and purple flowers. More cola shows on the palate with black cherry, plum-skin tartness and uplifting purple flowers, all presented on smooth tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Muted and diluted, this wine is missing structure and fruit, leaving dullness to the palate. Black currant and blackberry do their best to shine, amid toasty oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sweet and candied, like a dessert pastry, with sugary flavors of currants, chocolate and anise. The structure is fine. Will appeal to red wine drinkers with a sweet tooth."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A bright, tart, spicy wine with plenty of grip and detail, this threads flavors of herb, stem and earth into the substantial blackberry and cassis fruit. It's nicely woven together, penetrating and punchy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The winery shows its prowess with making delicious, affordable larger-production wines with this bright and easy drinking Cabernet, a study in soft tannins, juicy cranberry/currant fruit and composed structure. It's a good one to stock up on at the price and quality."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A juicy wine certain to please those who opt for the hip label, this is quite showy on the nose, with densely packed blackberries, clove, caramel and vanilla elements. The rich palate is equally poppy and boisterous, with black cherry jam, allspice and nutmeg notes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance. Compared to previous years, it's a little less generous but still a good way to go."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine marches to its own tune, with appealing but unusual opening notes of berries, plastic, chocolate and petroleum that add to the prominent red cherry note on the palate. There's a lot of extract here and a sweetish palate that takes on a coffee edge on the finish. Drink up."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dry and dusty, this lovely Cab shows red cherry sour candy, red currant, violet flower and smoky cedar flavors. The tannins are significant. It's a wine that needs time, but it should be very fine after 2011 and for several years after."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of herbs, tar and plum lead to sweet, plush blue fruit flavors. It's not a particularly serious wine but brings plenty of appeal."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's a ton of Cabernet flavor here. The California sunshine of this warm appellation ripened the grapes to cassis and black cherry perfection. The oak and tannin structure is polished and fine, but acidity is a little low, so it's not an ager. Drink now through 2009 for its sheer lusciousness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A little rough around the edges, with some green tannins and minty, herbal flavors. You get some candied cherries and currants, but the wine is pretty rustic."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dry and rich, it has hard tannins framing blackberry, blueberry, cassis and oak flavors. But it's somewhat generic."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Champoux and Ciel du Cheval vineyards each make up 40% of this wine, with the balance coming from Gamache. It's locked-up tightly at present with earth, tar, cherry, high-toned herb and barrel-spice aromas leading to focused black-fruit flavors that display elegance and persistence. Give it time to open up."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's a very good wine here that's yearning to express itself, but it's locked inside a straitjacket of tannins. Feels hard, astringent and resistant in the mouth. But it's huge in concentrated blackberries, cherries, anise and cedar, and gives the impression of drama and importance. Give it at least five years, and it could develop well beyond that."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Opens with aromas of black cherry, pepper, herbs and rubber. The palate is sort of flat and low in intensity, with smooth but basic flavors of vanilla and berry compote. Tastes sort of roasted and minty on the finish, but also full and sweet."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine offers a somewhat uncomfortable mix of herb, vanilla, caramel, green pepper and cherry notes. The mocha-filled flavors are tart, broad and supple, with good acidity and a dry lick of tannins backing it all up."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon, this has aromas of black-skinned berry, leather and cedar. The dense palate delivers black currant, espresso and clove alongside bracing tannins that leave a somewhat astringent finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Franc, this opulent, flashy young wine is made solidly in the modern cult style. It's soft and rich in new oak, offering massive blackberries, currants, cassis, violets and smoky cedar wood. The tannins are firm, but not hard, giving the wine structural support through the long, spicy finish. Needs time to show its stuff. 2012–2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A little sharp, but easily the winery's best non-vineyard designated Cab since the '02. Shows a ripeness level that slam dunks cherries, blackberries, cola and oak onto the palate, yet maintains an elegant dryness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tightly wound and a little muted, without much fruit on the nose or palate until the finish, which ends sweet. The Cab spent 26 months in barrel and is blended with 1% Petit Verdot."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon that offers cherry, plum and earthy spice, the tannins soft and supple. This is a wine to enjoy now, aged close to two years in French oak, 20% of it new."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cassis, mineral, floral notes and aromatic subtleties hint at sophistication and maturity. This is layered and well structured, with exotic spice flavors accenting oaky red-currant and plum notes. The finish is mellow, woody and fresh feeling. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Black cherry, leather, tar and nose-tickling clove aromas mix with a tad of green pepper on the nose of this signature bottling. The wine is very elegant in structure and memorable in flavors of peppercorn and cherry pie, all while retaining an acidic tartness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Founded by a well-heeled group of wine afficionadoes, Barons has seen a change of ownership and a change in winemaking direction. For the first time, French oak has begun to supplant American oak as the barrels of choice. The wine is aromatic, detailed and inviting, with the lower alcohol prevalent in 2011. A rich mix of berry and cassis dives deeply into the palate, with dark chocolate highlights. The tannins are silky and polished, and the wine seems a sure bet to cellar well until the mid-2020's."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A well-made wine, showing lots of terroir in the mineral-infused blackberry, black currant, chocolate and anise flavors. The tannins are structurally superb, while the finish is dry and complex. A very fine wine that should gather momentum for at least a decade."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Good, but disappointing. Blackberry, mint, chocolate and black cherry flavors are pretty, but thin, and the weight on the palate, the way the wine feels, is light and watered down. This absence of depth lets the alcohol and tannins star. It's obviously well-made, but is not a wine for the cellar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cranberry and currant dominate this restrained wine, wound up in tannins with a streak of sage accented by black pepper. On the finish expect deeper layers of chocolate and vanilla-caramel."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of charcoal and flavors of barbecue sauce make it pretty clear what to eat when drinking this bold, spicy and assertive wine. Moderate tannins give just enough texture to support this medium-bodied wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of baked plum, spice and bramble give it a sweet-savory opening. The palate is a touch scratchy but also endowed with tasty raspberry, plum and spice flavors. All totaled it's slightly heavy and probing, yet the burnt caramel, chocolate and dark fruit on the finish seem right for the wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Fruit forward aromas of plum, black currant, herb and spice lead to lightly sweet blue and black fruit flavors in this wine. Grainy tannins provide support, delivering easy-drinking appeal."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A full and solid wine with some leather and robust oak on the nose backed by racier cherry and plum flavors. The mnouthfeel and balance are both good, and overall the wine is packed to its core with berry boldness and choppy, serious tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A beautiful Cabernet, well structured, dry and rich. It feels soft and inviting in the mouth, with waves of ripe blackberries and cassis, and the fine tannins that accompany a good mountain red wine. Contains some Cabernet Franc, which adds cherry richness. Drink now for maximum freshness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Starts with young, bouncy, foxy aromas and then settles on berry fruit and bacon fat. The palate is somewhat rooty and sweet, with solid tannins, body and respectable cassis and berry flavors. A sweet wine with adequate richness and reasonably true Cabernet qualities."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"One of the plusses to having a cash-flow brand like Yellow Tail in the portfolio is that it gives the owners the opportunity to properly age their high-end wines prior to release. At 10 years old, this has acquired a veneer of silkiness and elegance that enfolds the cassis and red-currant fruit. There's no shortage of smoky, vanilla and brown-sugar inflected oak either. Drink now–2025."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This variety's signature dried- and fresh-herb aromas are on full display, with light barrel spices in the background. The palate brings lightly sweet plum and currant flavors that provide appeal."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a blend of the best barrels of the vintage, in this year consisting of fruit primarily from Howell and Diamond mountains, with a touch of estate-grown Merlot. It offers astounding levels of richness and concentration alongside a nuanced approach to bold black fruit and spicy earth, its aromas of blackberry and clove peppered in wild violet. It impresses immediately but also pleads for more time in bottle; enjoy best 2020 through 2028."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Late-picked, 100% Cabernet fruit from an iconic Red Mountain vineyard; hence the name, which translates as “the beast”. It's jammy and ripe, but the tannins have been tamed, and the fruit is front and center, along with brown spices and toasty barrel notes. This is a thoroughly delicious wine that seems to be drinking in its prime, though it shows no sign of tiring."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dried strawberry, cocoa, legume and savory spice notes weave together to comprise the bouquet. Medium in body, this has a soft entrance, but it gains tannic traction on the midpalate. A smoked rosemary flavor lingers on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft, lush and round, this wine has a dense backbone of oak and tannin and moderate acidity. Cherry cola and vanilla flavors ride along seamlessly to a toasty finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Made in a style that's lower in alcohol and earthier than your typical Napa Valley Cabernet, this bottling has plenty of complex elegance. The blackberry, tobacco and cedar flavors will pair well with steak. Drink now–2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a brawny, strongly powerful wine, fully displaying the grip of mountain fruit. Blackberry and black currant complement the tobacco and cedar. Drink now through 2023."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Amazingly ripe and sweet with blackberry jam, chocolate, cassis liqueur and oak. It's almost porty in its decadence, but what this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot lacks in subtlety, it more than makes up for in sheer power. Drink now–2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"You'll want to give this young Cab some time in the cellar, because it's locked down in tannins. Buried underneath the astringency is a wealth of sweet black currants and savory anise and sandalwood. Try after 2011."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A mix of strawberry-rhubarb compote, mocha-chocolate and chalky tannins are featured in this 80% Cabernet with smaller amounts of other Bordeaux varieties blended in. Dense and meaty, a powerful jolt of cassis rears its head on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A standard Cabernet, dry and tannic. The best thing is the deep core of blackberry, currant, mineral and spice flavors. Drink now–2014."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Rubbery blackberry aromas are dense and horsey. This feel wide and chunky but loose at the seams. Oaky flavors of generic black fruits finish medicinal and a touch candied.
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A soft, round Cabernet that's got leather, cedar and sage going on as well as heavy tannins and oak. Made from 100% organic grapes grown in Lake County, the wine reveals itself best after a bit of air."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A red-violet color, this wine has a bouquet of blackberry, lilac and pencil lead with a whiff of iodine. A network of velvety tannins and a vein of bold acidity are equally weighted, wrapped around flavors of blackberry, blueberry, black pepper, rose petal and Mediterranean herbs, with bright fruit persisting into the pleasing finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A plush, fancy Cabernet with all the trimmings. Ripe, opulent fruit is the foundation; above that, oak provides spicy complexities. The tannins are supersoft and plush, like drinking velvet, which may not contribute to the wine’s longevity but definitely makes it pleasing to drink right now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"You'll want to cellar this one, because it's tight and hard in tannins, as befits a well-made Diamond Mountain Cabernet. Entirely dry, it has a strong heart of cassis. But the structure is impeccable, and all it needs is time. Best after 2011 and probably well beyond."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"What a nice Paso Cabernet, perfect for drinking now. While dry in style, it's rich and sweet in black currant, anise and cedar flavors, and the thick tannins are just what you want in a full-bodied Cab. Wonderful with hearty beef dishes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"We all wonder if those cult Cabs will age, but there's no doubt that this is a cellar guarantee. Cathy Corison makes her Cabs less ripe than many others, so the alcohol is lower and the acids and tannins are harder and drier. That's in youth. But such is the depth of cherry, blackberry, cassis, cedar and mineral flavors and overall balance that this complex young wine should easily negotiate the next 15 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This might be the producer's most powerful and concentrated wine of the vintage. It impresses immediately for its tobacco, blackberry preserves, clove and a turn of black peppercorn that's hard to resist. Pencil lead and tar poke at the edges of the wine's huge texture, with serious weight and breadth. It finishes with a mouthwatering suppleness of juicy black fruit. Enjoy now through 2027."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Pure Cabernet, ageworthy wine. Right now it is quite tight, somewhat herbal and compact. The fruit is layered, a range from strawberry through cherry and into cassis, and it leads sharply into spicy tannins with a clear edge. This cellarworthy wine will need considerable breathing time; or pop it in the cellar for up to a decade."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A spicy aroma of ginger cookies meets dark, blackberry flavors on the palate of this medium-bodied, pure-tasting wine. The gushing fruit flavors are compelling and palate-cleansing, with light tannins and acidity keep it fresh and lively."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is gorgeous, structured and complex Cab: savory and Old World in style in some ways, revelatory in Napa richness and roundness in others. It conjures up visions of cherry crisp topped in vanilla gelato, with traces of smoke, dark chocolate and black pepper, the tannin integrated and persistent on the finish. This is a good choice for cellaring as well, through 2023."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Powerful from the start, this has an herbal berry aroma, with a rubbery hint and a lactic element. The palate is chewy, dense and rubbery, with creamy, milky flavors of blackberry, carob, vanilla and plastic. Generally speaking, this wine is full and solid."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine combines oaky sweetness with good, plummy fruit flavors and a lightly grippy texture. It's tasty and approachable in style."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Charred, smoky aromas are dominant on the nose. Strong tannins overpower baked fruit aromas and oaky and herbal tones."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The director has turned his eye to Sonoma County to produce less expensive wines.  It's a little too ripe, with blackberry, raisin and prune flavors and some edgy tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This full-bodied wine blends rich fruit flavors and abundant fine-grained tannins for a velvety texture that propels the cherry and blackberry flavors to a lingering finish. Made from an estate vineyard planted with four clones, it has excellent balance."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This dense, round, full-bodied red from a quiet appellation offers smoked plum and dark cherry flavors, with integrated oak and tannin."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Jim Barry's Cab program is on a roll, turning out a consistent set of wines from Clare and Coonawarra. Named in honor of the Australian cricket team, The First Eleven boasts a kaledioscopic range of berry fruit, accented by mint and darker notes of coffee, cocoa and cola. It's full-bodied and dense on the palate without being heavy, and finishes long, with impressive intensity and dusty tannins. Drink now–2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Saucy, herbal berry aromas come with gritty notes of earth and rubber. This feels chunky and grabby, with drawing tannins. Flavors of black plum, clove, green herbs and coffee grinds finish with a noticeable herbal boost."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Fruit stars in this young, rich Cabernet. It's as good as young, drink-me-now Napa Cab gets, offering waves of blackberries, cherries, plums, sweet oak and spices that go on and on into long finish. The tannins are perfectly ripe, the acidity fine and brisk."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's an uneasy mix of aromas of berry, green olive, herbs and tire rubber on this wine. The flavors seem light and dilute."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"What a great bargain this wine is. It's soft and delicious with blackberry, currant, brown sugar and creamy mocha flavors that lead to a spicy finish. It's easy to drink this Cab with all sorts of foods that pair well with a full-bodied red."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"One taste is all it takes to fall in love with this Cabernet. Made from Sonoma Valley and Knights Valley fruit, it's wonderfully sweet and deep in blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, with near-perfect tannins and a judicious touch of oak. Great for drinking now and over the next six years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is the winery's flagship Cabernet. It's full-bodied, with classic Bing cherry Cabernet fruit as a base flavor; then a wrapping of toast and broad, astringent tannins. There's ample acidity to lift it a bit, and finishing layers of coffee, licorice, smoke, olive and loam."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This oaky wine smells like baking spices and tastes almost sweet. It has jammy fruit flavors, warm vanilla and cinnamon accents, a soft texture and vanilla echoes on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Herbal in tobacco leaf and cedar, this is a medium-bodied, restrained and elegant wine, structured in robust tannin and mouthfeel with plenty of underlying acidity to keep it fresh and food-friendly."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Full bodied, and firm textured, this wine emphasizes complexity and mouthfeel over simple fruitiness. It smells like ripe plums, tastes like cardamom and black cherry, and shows good balance between flavors, acidity and body."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Smoky plum aromas give way to a crisp palate with sheer acidity. Flavors of tomato, plum and cherry are more raw than voluptuous. On the finish, this racy Cab displays enamel-peeling acidity and a can't-miss sense of freshness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dark, spicy and deeply flavored, this Cabernet is dense and concentrated in blackberry and cassis flavors, with a stony minerality at its core. The fruit is so ripely expansive, it tastes sweet on the finish, yet the wine is utterly dry. It's good now despite the hard mountain tannins, but should begin to blossom after 2014."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This bottling, from the winery's estate vineyard in the warm Pope Valley region, is ripe and relatively high in alcohol. It's a full-bodied blend, mainly Cabernet but with a drop or two of Malbec and Merlot, and rich in blackberries, chocolate and toasty new oak. The tannins are thick and furry, suggesting aging for six or so years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,This big but smooth wine has very ripe aromas and flavors that convey dried plums and rosemary. It's very full bodied and fine tannins keep the texture softer than usual.
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is an easy-drinking Cab for enjoying now. It's soft and fruit-forward, bursting with ripe, oak-tinged cherry and raspberry jam flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sweet caramel, a touch of mintiness, and some earth-tinged cassis grace the nose. That's followed up by simple fruit flavors and a corpulent mouthfeel held together by some light tannins on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"An open-book Cabernet medium in tannin structure and expressive in plum, blackberry and tobacco. Juicy with a rustic edge."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A nice Cabernet for drinking now. It's rich in berries, cherries, currants and oak, with smooth tannins and soft acidity. Shows an elaboration that makes it upscale and elegant."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine has a small amount of Syrah and is aged in new French, as well as Hungarian and American oak, much of it in older barrels. Opening like a perfumed rose garden, it offers a juicy core of cassis around integrated tannin and oak, with finishing touches of cedar, licorice and mocha."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft, with slightly dilute flavors of blackberry and currant, surrounded by oak. Turns vegetal as it opens."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The bouquet is dark and serious, with brooding black-cherry, leather and cedar aromas. In the mouth, flavors of black plums, mint-menthol and tobacco—all with a foresty accent—fill the palate. On the heavy side of medium-weight, with a supple texture, it has a long, toasty finish with fine tannins. Hold until 2004."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of berry and cassis come with a shot of raw oak. This is grabby and puts on the clamps, but spicy, peppery flavors of olive, berry and oak are very good in front of a hard, moderately tannic finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Piercing, jabbing aromas of wood and berry fruits lead to a juicy, acidic, fresh feeling palate with light, oaky, generic flavors of minty berry, herbs and oak. A modest, oaky finish is undistinguished."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sweet oak tones frame the black cherry and currant fruit in this wine, with notes of mocha and raspberry sauce atop. The velvety texture offers good tannic grip, while ample acidity helps to keep the palate fresh and the finish lifted. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"All is proper and well done in this Cabernet, from the dryness and smooth tannins to the flavors of blackberries, currants and cedar. It's a little thin, but the price is pretty good."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Restrained and refined, this lighter-weight Cab satisfies with dark cherry/berry aromas and flavors offset by earth and tobacco elements. Possessed of flavor and texture that should pair very well with a wide range of foods, think of this as an attractive South African claret. Drink now through 2004."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From a high-elevation vineyard on the eastern edge of Lake County, this Cabernet offers sensuously juicy, brambly fruit and a dusty backbone. Rich and chewy, it conveys intense cranberry, black cherry and woodsy cedar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Gen Yers and Baby Boomers will remember when Rosemount's ubiquitous Diamond Label wines represented great value. This Cab offers slightly confected cherry fruit, a whisper of mint and hints of vanilla. It's round in the mouth without being heavy, a fresh fruity wine for immediate gratification."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Barrel notes of vanilla and spice take the lead in this aromatically brooding wine, followed by dried herbs and dark fruit. The flavors are pitch black, coating the palate from end to end with layers of fruit, tannins that go the distance and a graphite-filled finish that lingers. It will drink best from 2020–2027."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This BSH is 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot, and includes 15% Cabernet Franc. It's among the best of the recent releases from O•S, with the two Cabs dominating with berry and cassis, earth and cacao. The tannins are lightly grainy and well-balanced."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Leafy red-berry aromas come with a note of olive. This wine feels lean and searing, with edgy tannins and high acidity. Spicy flavors of herbal plum and tomato finish with a dusting of baking spices."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Blended with Petit Verdot, this is a fragrant, opulent wine that's softly tannic and easy to drink. It has deep flavors of ripe blackberries, mocha, violets and smoky cedar. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Loamy, wide and jammy on the nose, with a note of raisin, this smells very ripe. In the mouth, it's more wiry and tartaric, but with an oaky creaminess that softens things up. Typical Chilean Cab flavors of berry, cassis and herbs finish chunky and full."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Defines the Paso Robles style of enormously ripe fruit and softness. Incredibly rich in brown sugar, blackberry jam, chocolate and smoky oak flavors, it's not particularly subtle, but delicious now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cignale always pleases and is consistent year after year thanks to its rich texture, meaty tones and complex aromas that recall blueberry, peppercorn and garden herbs. It is a joint venture between importer Neil Empson and producer Alessandro François."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This opens with aromas of black cherry, chocolate, prune and blackberry jam. Freshness and subtle softness picks up on the rear of the wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This older wine is 64% from Alexander Valley and 36% from Mendocino County. It offers meaty flavors of soy and leather, the fruit elements starting to decline. It's still interesting, though, and holding on to a core of acidity. Do not decant."
Cabernet Sauvignon,This wine has aromas of pomegranate and black plum. It conveys flavors of cranberry and black raspberry. The finish is short-lived yet pleasantly acidic.
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Made in Sbragia's muscular style, a ripe, flashy wine, with briary blackberry, currant, mocha and oak flavors. The tannins are strong but soft, and the overall impression is complex. Fine now with steak, barbecue, but should gain bottle complexity over the next 5–6 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This doesn't show any particular Stags Leap character; it's another dry, tannic and lean Cabernet, with cherry syrup flavors. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sugary sweet in berry-cherry fruit, with a cut of acidity that doesn't feel natural. An awkward wine, but passable."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tarry dark-fruit aromas are piercing and slightly herbal. This is a staunch, rock-solid Cab with tannic bite and structural grip. Flavors of black fruits and oak finish spicy, with notes of licorice and woodspice. Freshness combined with ripeness and body weight conveys the wine's depth and overall quality."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Piercing aromas of red-berry fruits and red-apple skins are a touch rough but improve with airing. This feels fresh, medium in size, and tastes of herbal plum and cherry prior to a lightly herbal finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A sound, everyday Cab, good for downing with beef. Dry and tannic, it shows flavors of blackberries, currants, herbs and oak. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This was the final vintage Patrick Campbell fully presided over before selling the winery. It's a dense and compact wine, showing mountain tannins framing black currant, cassis, mineral, violet and new oak flavors. Despite the opulence, the finish is dry. Made from 100% Cabernet, the wine needs time in the cellar. Try it after 2018, and it should be rolling along in the mid-2020s."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine from Rick Grimm and winemaker Paul Lato shows stunning potential for this new vineyard. Blackberry, thyme, black pepper and crushed slate aromas lead to a tremendously savory, umami-packed palate, where bay leaf and stewed mushroom notes envelop a core of blackberry and black currant fruit. The structure is solid, and the finish is long and strong."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rich and ripe, with Cabernet fruit swamping the mouth with jammy blackberries, cherries, currants and chocolate. As fruity as it is, it's well structured, with firm tannins and a fine edge of acidity. Beautiful to drink now, but give it some breathing time after opening, or decant."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tight in elegant raspberry and cassis fruit, this small-production Cabernet is on the cool-climate side of the equation, reflective of the vintage. Tastes of black and bell peppers are interspersed with cedar, and the finish is purely oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dark berry, leather and herbaceous notes on the nose open to cherry, currant and tobacco flavors—it's all very much in the Bordeaux vein. The mouthfeel is similar: somewhat lean and angular but very flavorful, with an expansive cherry flavor on the spicy, long finish. Has good tannic structure, and may merit a higher score with some age. Hold for four to six years, and then drink til 2012."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rubbery dark-fruit aromas are surrounded by hints of olive, minerals and spice. This feels round as well as fair and balanced; flavors of loamy blackberry are smooth and come with chocolate notes. Coffee, spice and herbal flavors work the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,The Cabernet Sauvignon structure shows strongly in this firm wine. Mint and black currant flavors are dense and concentrated. The tannins give a dry character to the wine that contrasts with its fruitiness. Drink from 2017.
Cabernet Sauvignon,"For this well-made, robust wine, the producer taps into multiple vineyard sources, including William Hill and Monte Rosso. Hung around a focused structure, it offers classic elements of dried herb, clove and graphite, with significant tannin that persists through a lengthy finish of toasty oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Plum, cassis, herb and spice aromas make for a full, pleasant bouquet. This shows a thick tannic plodding palate along with quick-hitting berry and cassis flavors. Lasting acidity on the finish creates welcome freshness and length."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Here's a rich, complex Napa Cabernet for drinking now while you're waiting for your more ageable wines to mature. It boasts a decadent structure housing ripe flavors of blackberries, black currants and smoky, toasty oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The earthy aromas of this medium-bodied wine will not be to everyone's liking, but it follows up with very ripe fruit flavors and a smooth texture."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine is quite blue-fruited aromatically for a Cabernet. This continues on the palate, with boysenberry flavors backed by lightly grainy tannins. It provides interest, but you'd never peg it for Cabernet Sauvignon."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Preponderant green, herbal aroma and flavor marks this wine. The mix of pencil lead and a smoky char never really make friends."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This easy-to-drink wine has aromas of blackberry and cassis with a touch of bell pepper. Offering good mouthfeel and smooth tannins, it has flavors of black cherry, eucalyptus, chocolate and smoked meat, with a touch of orange peel on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Brooding aromas of the blackest of fruit, anise and cassis are followed by a velvet hammer of sweet dried-fruit flavors backed by burly tannins. Medicinal and dark-fruit notes persist on the finish. It seems slightly dried out but still delivers the goods."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A little harsh in mouthfeel, with some minty green notes that give it the flavor of sweet-and-sour cherry and currant sauce. Needs a cheeseburger to tame it."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft and fruity, this has ripe black-cherry and blackberry compote flavors, plus plenty of oak influence. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Layered berry and cassis aromas are a bit scratchy and gritty. This Cabernet feels saturated, pure and deep; flavors of blackberry, cassis, prune and chocolate are ripe and generous, while the finish is mildly herbal in flavor, with good length and build. Drink through 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Herb, red apple, copper penny and dark cherry aromas are followed by sweet, full dark cherry flavors. The tannins are firm, needing some time to soften."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Full bodied and lavishly oaked, this wine boasts gorgeous shadings of brown sugar, clove and cinnamon layered over cassis and red berries. The plush finish lingers, folding in plum and vanilla. Drink now–2023."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Hard and herbal, this has sour, barely-ripe fruit and chalky tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The complexity starts with dusty mineral tones that slowly segue into perfectly mature blackberry, balsam tones and spicy oak notes at the end. It is that amazing evolution of aromas, which reads like a storybook of Tuscany, that makes this wine a standout."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Built around a core of acidity, this wine conveys a preponderance of cedar and sage, seemingly influenced by a softer variety like Merlot, of which it has 12%. Plum and black currant provide the fruit component, before a sizably tannic finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A fine bottle — full, fleshy, immediately throwing out dense aromatics with toast and roasted coffee and bitter chocolate components. A deep vein of black cherry and cassis keeps the core tight and focused, and a small splash of Syrah adds the scent of black pepper."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Blended with a drop of Merlot, this Cabernet Sauvignon remains deeply tannic and dry. It has classic flavors of black currants, anise liqueur and minerals, with quite a bit of acidity. It's complex, compelling and still far too young. Give it until 2018 to begin to come around, and it will be gorgeous in the mid-2020s."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The bell pepper, cedar and green bean notes in this wine come across as astringent and thin."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Estate vineyards from near the town of Napa and Mount Veeder contribute to this wine, which includes 6% Malbec and 4% Merlot. Big, generous, pillowy tannins meet dust, rock and chalk to confront a wall of spicy, savory flavor and complexity, a mix of cinnamon and black pepper."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Even though the alcohol is a high 15.3% abv, this Cabernet tastes like it still has some residual sweetness. It's as rich and ripe in blackberries, but awkward, and doesn't seem capable of aging."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Here's a bone-dry, somewhat lean Cabernet. It has tobacco and blackberry flavors, framed in rich, furry tannins. Quite a nice sipper for drinking now with grilled steaks and chops."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"As impressive as the woman—a pioneer in the Napa Valley—was herself, this 100% varietal wine from the estate property high atop Diamond Mountain is powerfully elegant, intense yet refined. It begins with a high-toned, graceful entry that's rich in blueberry and chocolate, the oak smooth and integrated, with a suggestion of hand-rolled tobacco. Drink now through 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Intense aromas of pressed blackberries and blueberries show on the nose of this dessert wine that leans way more fresh than pruney. The palate is loaded with rich, full flavors of fudge, blueberry jam and a long-lasting licorice note. Strong acidity and judicious alcohol give it structural backbone, and makes it the perfect foil for an end-of-night cigar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Murky aromas of earth and black fruits introduce a hard, grabby palate. Heavy oak creates a hickory flavor to go with roasted, herbal black-fruit notes, while this finishes sticky, resiny and oaky, with heat and grabby residual tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of barrel spice are up front on this locked-up wine, followed by pencil lead, herb, vanilla, black currant and cherry. The palate brings a compelling sense of texture, juxtaposed by aggressive tannins that need a significant amount of time to come into their own. Don't go near it for a decade but it should last well beyond that. Best from 2027–2035."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine's tightly wound woodspice, black cherry, cocoa, caramel and herb aromas are followed by tart, plentiful dark fruit flavors. It needs some time for its chewy, lightly dry tannins to settle, but plenty of good things are going on. Give it some time in the cellar or a long decant."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A bit on the hot side, reflecting the extra warmth that the Pope Valley region of eastern Napa Valley gets during the summer. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's massively flavored, huge in jammy blackberries, cherries, cassis and dark chocolate. The tannins are considerable, the finish long and ripe. Best to open this wine by 2015 or so."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This full and smoothly soft wine blended with 10% Petite Sirah, 7% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot is aged in American oak, a quarter of it new. It pleases in bright red currant, cassis and wisps of blackberry, both approachable and sophisticated. Velvety black licorice meets smoky campfire on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Juicy in ripe cassis and clove, this exuberant Cab with tamed, soft tannins explodes on impact. With a sanguine note to the background, the wine's oak is pronounced but in check, giving a plush impression."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This 100% varietal wine shows raspberry jam, fruit leather and plum aromas that are bright on the nose. The palate packs tart fruit flavors supported by plump, ripe tannins. It's not your typical Cabernet but still provides appeal, though the alcohol dominates at times."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mature and smooth, showing brown sugar and caramel sweetness alongside tobacco and soy. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Gunpowder, charcoal, licorice, mint and exotic black fruits are all components of the nose. The palate is firm and drying, with rock-hard tannins that will likely never go soft. So drink this secure, structured Cabernet with food, and drink it now or over the next three or four years, and it will show you what true reserve-level Chilean Cab is all about. Imported by Orvino Imports."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Brambly on the nose, with equally challenging and drying flavors of cranberry and rhubarb. There's very little to say about this stripped-down Cabernet other than that it's generally clean and not brutally offensive."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"So much oak on this wine, it's like being inside a barrel. Vanilla, buttered toast, caramel and char flavors star, with a bit of blackberry fruit struggling to express itself."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dramatic all around. Deeply aromatic, offering waves of grilled blackberries, currants, violets, sweet buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood. The tannin structure is superb. Feels classically dense and full-bodied in the mouth, very dry, yet opulent and complex. Grows more concentrated as it airs in the glass. A tremendous wine that needs time. 2012–2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A Napa Valley wine from the Central Coast folks at Fess Parker Winery, this Cab was aged for more than two years in 67% new French oak. Briary, it drips in brawny black fruit and highlights of tobacco, clove, leather and black pepper. An uplifting hit of acidity maintains a balance against the heft."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cabernet collectors who look beyond Napa Valley should be aware of this wine. It's an important addition to the Alexander Valley pantheon, a densely layered young wine. Shows brilliant red stone fruit, cassis, cola, date nut bread, mocha and tangerine zest flavors gorgeously lavished with the vanilla and smoky caramel of oak. Just delicious now, and should slowly spread its wings for many years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"As the name suggests, this is an elemental Cabernet, offering pleasant blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. Rich and ripe in California sunshine fruit, it's smooth in tannins and easy to drink."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The latest entrant into the Napa Cabernet sweepstakes succeeds with this flashy wine. Made from grapes grown in the warm Vaca Hills east of the Silverado Trail, this wine impresses immediately with aromatics of black currants, mocha and lightly toasted French oak. In the mouth, it's pure Cabernet pleasure, with soft, compelling tannins and fine acidity. It's a dramatic wine that should develop well over the next 10 years, if not longer. This is a winery to watch."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This moderately aromatic wine features notes of black cherry, clove and abundant high-toned herbs. A supple mouthfeel with black fruit flavors accompanies firm, dry tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This interesting Cabernet combines brambly berry fruit with a streak of maple syrup. Aged 22 months in a mix of French and American oak (roughly half new), it has picked up a hint of pickle spice along the way. Flavors are nicely integrated and work well together on the lasting finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Earthy blackberry aromas are spicy and moderately complex. Structured and sound on the palate, with a strong tannic framework, this tastes of well-defined cherry and cassis. Spice and chocolaty notes on the finish are barrel driven."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Blackberry and chocolate flavors intertwine nicely in this soft, round and bright red from a tiny site in the appellation. Lightly spiced with clove and cedar, it strikes a balance between fruit and tension, making it a food-friendly option that won't overpower in the glass."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's a tension between leanness and grip in this Cab, from the mountainous terrain of Atlas Peak. Black tea and tarragon intermingle between near-hidden layers of black fruit."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine blended from multiple vineyard souces represents tremendous value for its quality. Black cherry and cedar notes mark its flavorful but thick midpalate, giving way to dried herb and black currant on the chocolatey finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"With firm acidity and big tannins, this Cabernet is nowhere ready to drink. It shows an almost old-time Howell Mountain aggressiveness. It's also relatively low in alcohol, the kind of wine that Napa doesn't produce much of anymore. All signs, including an intense concentration of blackberries and stone fruits, are that it's an ager. Cellar until 2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Masses of sweet blackberry jam give this Cabernet an easy deliciousness. The fruit and oak are balanced with fine tannins and a gentle scour of acidity. Not one for the cellar, but it will benefit from an hour or two in the decanter."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"They packed a lot of flavor into this wine, then let it age for five years before releasing. It offers plenty of pleasure, at a great everyday price. Soft and round, its flavors are of blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar. Just delicious."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This small-production Cab is at first faint in subtle fruit but slowly works its magic, offering balanced layers of black currant and blackberry around soft, toasty mocha oak, picking up nuance and complexity on the way to a lingering finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Forward and flavorful, this brings together five different grapes from eight different vineyards, though it is mostly (70%) Wahluke Slope Cabernet Sauvignon. I found a hint of funk, cooked raisin, and lots of baking spices. Penetrating, unusual flavors, but overall not quite together."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The blend includes 18% Syrah, which helps to emphasize the spice and sweet fruit flavors. But in the back, this is a stiff and fairly tannic wine, with a disconnect between the strawberry fruit and the slightly stemmy, herbal finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A beautiful aroma like violets, cedar, light oak smoke and black cherry wafts from this deeply colored wine. It brings ripe fruit flavors and a hint of toasted oak to the palate, filling the mouth with juicy black cherry, cassis and blueberry. Touches of dark chocolate are bolstered by ample layers of fine-grained tannins. This is a full-bodied, lightly sweet and elegantly balanced wine to drink now through 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sappy, grapey fruit is joined by strong herbal overtones reminiscent of dried oregano and parsley. While some panelists felt it had potential to develop over the next couple of years, others dismissed it for saline aromas that they termed “fishy.”"
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Notes of cedar and violet meld with a ripe, juicy black-fruit flavor in this bold, deeply concentrated Cabernet. Softer and riper than the Rezerva, it has a slightly grapey midpalate. It's full-bodied in style, with a frame of lush, furry tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Juicy blackberry notes are freshened by lively acidity in this big, bold, succulent wine built for meaty, peppery fare. The fruit is complemented by complex cedar and pine seasonings."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A year older than the Riboli family's higher-end San Simeon brand, this bargain bottling is a steal for the oft-ridiculed vintage. Dense elderberry fruit, smoked cedar and dried oregano show on the nose, while the palate is complex and herbacesously Bordelaise in style, with oregano, thyme and dill giving nuance to tart blueberries and black plum fruit."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is the winery's first release of this vineyard-designated wine. Cocoa, fresh herb, tire rubber and cherry aromas are followed by cassis flavors backed by tightly wound tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's a slightly scorched character to this wine that I had a tough time getting past. There's solid plummy fruit, but also recurring hints of freshly sawn lumber and burnt coffee. It's full bodied, with plenty of astringent tannins, so it might age past this current stage, and it's possible this rating could look stingy in a few years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Bramble, leather and red fruit make for a decent nose, while the palate is basically deep and fruity, with an emphasis on blackberry and cherry flavors. For the most part the wine has structure and feel, although there's a spot of bitterness on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A more approachable combo of mostly Cabernet with 20% Merlot, this wine is rounder and softer on the palate than some of its vineyard-designated brethren, and yet still appropriately grippy for the vintage. Plum, chocolate, cedar and leather all make appearances, as the wine expands into a luxurious finish. Drink now through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The nose on this wine is quite interesting, with a ripe cranberry scent and a prominent note of marijuana. That herbal, grassy note is also the main player on the palate, as there's not much fruit or other components to go with it. It's light in body and tannin, with ample acidity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft and round, this 100% varietal wine made from two clones is juicy and fresh in acidity, a sense of restraint allowing it to sconvey more than just fruit. Cassis, black pepper, cedar and a slight streak of menthol combine nicely on the palate, intertwining on the lengthy finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There is much to enjoy in this vineyard-designate, from grippy tannins to dark, brooding black fruit. Burly, it also tends toward barbecue smoke and cigar, a dense wine of great power and alcohol, aged entirely in new French oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This earthy red starts with aromas of cedar, smoke and pepper, followed by flavors of red berries, smoke and minerals. A dry and peppery backbone fishes clean on the tongue. Spunky and fun."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Taut but complex aromatics of black plum, chocolate, soy, and cedar open this very dark-hued contender. The oak here is lavish, and the wine appeals with its dark-cherry and toast flavors. Closes with a dry, evenly tannic finish. The insistent heavy toast makes it perhaps a bit of a one-noter, but it's a good example of this popular style."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This iconic Chilean Cabernet is firm on the nose, with cola, cassis, cherry and leather aromas. It's racy, juicy and powerful, with flavors of cassis, blackberry, plum, nutmeg and coffee that swim in harmony. This is big, but also elegant and clean. Drink through 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Elegant and in balance, despite its powerful mix of ripeness and tension, this wine offers cranberry, thyme, oregano, graphite and tar. All combine for a savory succulence of intrigue and deliciousness, finishing in a length of black pepper."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The oak is at the fore on this wine, with aromas and flavors of vanilla, dill and baking spices in front of cherry and green pepper. The aromas give a sense of some oxygen exposure."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Intense concentration and firm structure make this an age-worthy, big and tannic wine. It boasts a deep, dark color, dense ripe blackberry and black cherry aromas and spicy, oaky nuances that add complexity. Best after 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of cranberry, raspberry, rose hips and green herbs are all high-toned. The red-fruit flavors are elegantly styled and fresh in feel, backed by soft, plump tannins. It shows hang time on the finish. This is a very pretty wine and a unique expression of the variety and vineyard."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A crisp medium-bodied Cab with good varietal definition, Strathewen Hill's 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon boasts slightly minty cassis-inflected fruit, vanilla and chocolate notes and a smooth mouthfeel. Supple tannins on the finish suggest this will age well through 2012 or so."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This pure Cabernet spent 22 months in a mix of French and American oak, though what percentage was new is not stated. It enters the palate with a pleasing mix of cassis, tar and a hint of mint, then seems to hit a wall and fade."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is an extraordiary deal for a solidly built, high-level wine. It offers succulent cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors, wrapped in approachable, mellowed tannin and oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Earthy, this wine offers substantial layers of dried herb and cranberry. Denser overtones of oak and tannin are pronounced on the midpalate, the tannins weighty and firm. A lift of acidity picks up on the finish. The wine will benefit from time in the cellar, through 2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Always reliable, and often a value, this vintage William Hill hits paydirt with well-etched blackcurrant flavors wrapped in a shroud of toasty oak. The dry tannins are dusty and complex, and the wine feels velvety on the palate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Inebriating aromas of hearty tobacco, black earth, cassis and prune kick off another barrel-aged monster from Dave Corey. The cherry syrup and plum liqueur flavors remain bright with strong acidity as well as sturdy tannic structure, meaning this one will last until 2020 at least."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A softly layered, elegant estate wine, this slowly reveals shocks of cherry, vanilla and coconut. A tanginess to the tannins gives it an oomph of verve and freshness on the palate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Shows the classic structure of Oakville, with impeccably ripe tannins, and the winemaker's touch of oak is deft. The black currant flavors could use a bit more concentration, though, as there's a stubborn thinness throughout."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This red interlaces juicy red fruit with soft, elegantly rendered layers of tannin and oak. It's highlighted with crisp acidity, its tart cranberry and red currant flavors complemented by a dusting of subtle dried herb."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A controversial wine, tasted twice. It's soft and tannic, with candied cherry-berry, mocha and sweet oak flavors. Seems at once dull and powerful. Hard to know where it's going, but the benefit of the doubt suggests 4–5 years in the cellar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dried oregano and cedar aromas meet dark cherry and graphite notes on the nose of this bottling. The palate is light and somewhat thin, with herb, crushed rock and dark berry flavors, finishing on a caramel note."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Beautifully floral, this wine sings with red cherry and cassis notes and bright acidity. Beneath its façade of freshness and perfume lies a weighty foundation of toasted oak, forest floor, clove and dark chocolate flavors. Balanced and full-bodied, it shows the dustiness of the appellation in a measured, elegant way."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A tasty array of clove, tamarind and cinnamon aromas are followed by rich fruit and spice flavors in this medium-bodied, moderately tannic wine. It has lots of personality, good balance and a lingering finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine comes from the state's oldest Cabernet Sauvignon vines, planted in 1957. Light in color, the aromas draw you into the glass with notes of earth, cassis, dried herb and cherry. The cranberry flavors are light and elegant, with a zing of acidity that keeps the interest high. It's a very pretty expression of the variety, best suited for the dinner table."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From the heart of the Rutherford Bench, this estate-grown wine is a classic version of restraint and elegance, structured in dusty tannin with bursts of cedar, tomato leaf and cassis. Cabernet Franc makes up 8% of the blend, with 3% Merlot. This will benefit from time in the cellar; drink 2020–2023."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine reflects both the challenge and some of the enjoyment of the cool 2011 vintage in Washington. Aromas of green herbs intermingle with barrel spices. It's elegantly styled with abundant vanilla, coffee and cherry flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A very nice wine that's dry and balanced, and shows quite a bit of elegance. The alcohol is low, and the flavors of cherries, currants, herbs, anise and cedar are savory."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A beautiful black currant character animates this classically-styled wine. It's fruity and generously spiced on the nose, with cinnamon and nutmeg scents from oak. Its flavors build on that black currant, with spice notes giving it a layered effect, supported by fine-grained tannins. While irrestible now, this will be best after 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Attractively priced, this Cab—with 5% Petit Verdot—offers meaty bacon and smoky oak character around sizable tannins, black currant, black licorice and a finishing dust of mocha."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a 100% varietal wine, aged for 32 months, with one-quarter of the barrels being new oak. Grippy in red currant and cranberry, it has a thickness of tannin and slightly bittersweet, tobacco-like finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From estate-grown fruit, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is dark in mocha and generous dry tannins, softened on the midpalate by vanilla, caramel and candied cherry."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Yeasty and buttery like fresh-baked bread, this wine shows layers of high-toned cranberry flavor and soft, integrated tannin. Lightly dusted in black pepper and clove, it's bright and fresh, while allowing dense blueberry and raspberry to shine through its framework of structure."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The vineyard is source of high-quality fruit, but also intense mountain tannins that require time to melt. Under those tannins is dramatically rich black currant and carob fruit flavor, easily big enough to sustain 100% new French oak. By 2009 this 100% Cab should begin to soften and sweeten, and it will drink beautifully for at least six more years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Here's a good, gutsy Cab that won't push Napa out of the spotlight, but offers sound drinking at a fair price. Dry and ready to drink now, it has the classic varietal flavors of black currants, black cherries and cedar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Made in the style of Monticello's 2008s, a ripe, softly delicious wine. It packs lots of berry, cherry, currant and chocolate fruit, with a savory earthiness suggesting green olives. Flashy enough to drink now, and could gain bottle interest over the next six years, if not longer."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a carefully made Cabernet, 100% varietal, with light and clean fruit flavors of plum and cherry. The mix of French and American oak (how new unspecified) is lightly applied, and the wine is nicely balanced, but no blockbuster."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Alluring notes of pastry dough, spiced blackberry and strawberry-flavored fruit leather carry onto the succulent, medium- to full-bodied palate. Firm tannins bolster the wine's nutty herbal-tea flavor, and it concludes with a textured finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is overtly rustic, roasted, leathery and strange on the nose. A wide but wayward palate seems sluggish, while rubbery black-fruit and burnt-wood flavors finish with murky berry tones."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This rich, complex Cabernet feels dramatic in the mouth. It impacts immediately with black currant, cassis and oak flavors, yet is thoroughly dry, with firm, smooth tannins and an oily umami chewiness, like charred steak fat off the grill. The winemaker, Julien Fayard, previously was at Lafite Rothschild. He brings a Bordeaux-esque sensitivity to Napa's rich, ripe fruit. Hold until 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Olsen and Upland vineyards provide the fruit for this wine. It brings aromas of cedar, herb and blueberry that are followed by a sweet luscious palate backed by lightly grainy tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Earthy and ripe, this midnight-black Cab opens with ripe aromas of prune, tobacco and oak-related coconut. A tannic, resiny palate deals rich, heady flavors of mocha, blackberry and coconut, while an oak-dominated finish heaps on a final dose of coconut along with hard tannins. Drink through 2021."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Squeezed plums and deep pomegranate extract gain some funky complexity from damp mushrooms, sour plum skins and wet wood on the nose of this bottling. The flavors are heavy with juniper, smoked pine and exotic woods, and the dried berry fruit compensates for the herbaciousness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Perfumed oak and funky earthiness permeate the nose and palate of this wine, with punchy cedar and bay notes. It lingers long on forest floor, pine and other woodsy components through its medium-bodied ripeness and structure."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Juicy cranberry and pie cherry fruit brings this wine into clear focus. There is an underpinning of wet cement that comes across in the mid-palate, a sort of a stone wall that the fruit can't quite overcome. It fades into an astringent, tannic finish, still buoyed by those juicy acids."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A rare reserve-level Cabernet only made once before, this 100% varietal wine hails from esteemed Kiona and Ciel du Cheval vineyards. Char and dark roasted coffee aromas meld with notes of herbs, spice and black fruit. The flavors are dense, layered and concentrated, but also show finesse and detail, with the palate broadening out considerably over time. The tannins are polished but still tightly wound and will benefit from an extended period in the cellar. Best from 2022 to 2028 but has the stuffing to get there and beyond."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Still strong and jammy at the age of four-plus, with fresh blackberry, black currant and spicy oak flavors brightened with zingy acidity. It's a distinctly New World wine, and a very good one, but it needs a year or three in the cellar to mellow and resolve."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Black-fruit aromas are accented by notes of licorice, green herbs and grass. This is full and chunky, but a bit hollow in mouthfeel. Pronounced tartaric acidity results in surface-level pop along with hollowness, while lactic oak and coconut flavors on the finish are familiar for Argentine Cabernet."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is the inaugural release from this winery that focuses on the expression of Cabernet in a different site each year. It's dazzling, rich with blackberry, black currant, herb, dark chocolate and barrel spices. The full-bodied flavors are candy-bar sweet with some chewy tannic heft that bodes well for its potential in the cellar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Grippy with tannin and firm structure, this warm-vintage wine shows rich red cherry, currant and spicy clove flavors. Tinged with a touch of reduction, it gains depth and mouthfeel from its prominent oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Good blackberry, black currant, cocoa and cedar flavors in this Cab, and it's nicely dry, with firm, finely ground tannins. Turns rather sharp on the finish, and that tartness may never go away."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From a famed vineyard in the warm enclave of northern Napa Valley, this wine has soft tannins and a focus of blackberry, black licorice and tar, its fruit becoming more explosive on the palate as it goes. The finish offers additional length and weight."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Cabernet Franc from a sweet vineyard spot near Dalle Valle, this is a lovely, softly textured wine. Shy on the nose yet powerful on the palate, it offers a burst of tightly wound tannin and leather at the fore. Chocolate and dried herb with a layering of black licorice give it a dark complexion and build. Be sure to mellow it in the cellar, through 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is the winery's more accessible and approachable Cabernet, ready to drink. Robust flavors of tobacco and brambly blackberry provide a nod to the mountain provenance. The wine spent more than a year in oak, 30% of it new French and 10% of it new American. The wood flavor is pronounced, a taste of vanilla an endpoint to the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"California Cabernet simply doesn't get richer or riper than this. It explodes with blackberry and cherry jam and chocolate flavors whose sweetness persists into the long, spicy finish. And yet the wine is technically dry. Drink over the next few years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine is a bit austere and tough to warm up to, with dry, leafy overtones encircling tangy cassis fruit like a cigar wrapper. Firm and crisp on the finish; try it in another year or two—it might improve with short-term cellaring."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine presents an old-fashioned style, marked by hard, numbing tannins that frame ripe flavors of blackberries, licorice, cherries, mocha and black currants. Hard to tell where it's going beyond the next six years, but give it a proper decanting and drink with roasted or grilled meats."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Baked and broad on the nose, with toasty aromas, marshmallow sweetness and floral hints. The palate is tight, healthy and tastes of savory, meaty fruit including black cherry and wild raspberry. Leather and herbal notes work the finish, and overall this is nice but more basic than complex."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Whiffs of black coffee and wet soil mingle amidst plump black cherry and berry notes on nose of this medium-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate shows a cooler crisper black-fruit profile, accented by swathes of green leaves and herbs. The finish is a bit tart, lingering on a bite of penetrating tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This 100% Cab is a big, rich wine, and while its power is considerable, it lacks subtlety. There's no question about the intensity of blackberries, cherries and spicy persimmons, unrivaled anywhere in the world. Yet ripeness isn't everything. Hard to see this explosion of fruit going anywhere, so drink soon."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's a spotlight on ripe, brooding black plums and cherries in this big, powerful Turkish Cabernet Sauvignon. It's densely structured, with fine-grained, yet deeply penetrating tannins, and a streak of high acidity, but there's an elegant suppleness throughout that hints of a long maturation ahead."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"When people talk about good value Cabs from Chile, this is what they should be referring to. The nose is balanced and offers plenty of clean berry aromas, while the palate is fresh, light in weight and mildly citrusy, with flavors of cassis, plum and raspberry. More snappy and fresh than weighty."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Over-oaked, with caramelized vanilla aromas and flavors dominating. Under all that is a pretty good Cabernet, with blackberry and cherry flavors and smooth tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Made from 100% Cabernet, this is a classic Napa Valley wine. It's dry, but the fruit is sweetly ripe, and it has firm, supple tannins and balancing acids. The rich flavors are of dark chocolate and black currants, with a heady note of summer blueberries. This will evolve over the years, but it's best enjoyed soon for its sheer deliciousness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This big, ripe wine is soft and round, with integrated tannins. It evokes licorice, blackberry jam and toast on the palate, with mountain sage and molasses notes that linger on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A whiff of leather introduces a wine with a strong savory character; the leather and earth flavors start to bury the sweet berry fruit, and the tannins take on a chalky texture."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rasula shows ripe aromas of blackberry and prune with lingering tones of spice and leather in the background. It's a simple value wine with a chewy, rich mouthfeel."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Black plum juice, black pepper, caramel and smoke mark the nose of this bottling, which is fairly light in color. It's thin in body yet offers familiar black cherry and herbal spice flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tight and tannic, this majority Cab wine is distinguished by a thickness of black fruit and herbaceous back palate that gives it density, separated by bursts of vanilla and oak. Give it time to open and notes of mocha chocolate should also come through."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A bit soupy and soft on the nose, with mulch, oak and tobacco along with dark-fruit aromas. This marks the second vintage of Intriga, a new Maipo Valley Cabernet Sauvignon from MontGras, and it's full and chewy, with raspberry flavors and size. Shows a touch of syrupy thickness on the finish. Weighty and definitely ripe. Drink soon."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lushly rich on both the nose and the palate, this wine from the heart of the appellation is etched in chocolate and cedar, showing a ying-yang pull between savory and sweet. Currant and dried herb season chalky, firm tannin and toasted oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The nose delivers solid, generally clean berry aromas with lift. The palate is bouncy, shows decent acidity, and bumps along while offering standard red berry flavors in front of a light, medicinal finish. Good everyday Cab for the price."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mocha, coffee, leather, brandied red fruit and a grassy aroma define the bouquet on this sweet, ripe-tasting Cabernet that's full of cherry and candied berry flavors. A sweet, jammy finish has a little burn to offer."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lush, rich, beguiling now. Tastes fat and unctuous, like a Pomerol despite being made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, offering a creamy wealth of cherries, currants, chocolate, anise, herbs, spices and smoky oak. For all the flamboyance, it's bone dry, with classically solid Napa tannins, courtesy of fruit from Oakville and Howell Mountain. Should develop in the bottle through 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a very good Cab to drink now for its firm, dry mouthfeel and ripe flavors of cherries, currants and cedar. It feels elegant and distinguished. But it's also thick in dusty tannins, and should slowly evolve in the bottle for 6–7 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine has a dark red color, bold, smoky, tobacco-like aromas, full body, generous blackberry and dark plum flavors, firm tannins and a dry impression overall. It seems to improve and show more depth with each sip. Drink now through 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a new project from the Bundschu family of Gundlach Bundschu, a chance to highlight some high-quality fruit from the new Moon Mountain AVA. Toasty in oak and a hint of bacon, it's big, chewy, sanguine and rich in coffee and chocolate, with mountain-proud tannins that add structure and complexity amid the power."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is surprisingly tough and tannic for a 2007, but it does show the vintage's impressive fruit flavors. Notes of blackberry and cherry jam are complexed by touches of cassis liqueur and smoky cedar. The tannins will need to be tamed by rich, fatty fare, like grilled steak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Touches of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Merlot contribute to this wine's overall complexity. The cuvée formerly known as “Cask,” it now emphasizes the historic estate property. Red currant and cedar notes and firm tannins strike first, as bright, underlying acidity provides balance. Tobacco leaf and chocolate flavors mark the long finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rusty in color and earthy on the nose, with capped aromas of cedar and herbs, this mature Catalonian Cabernet is compact on the palate and fused by firm tannins. Flavors of dried berry, stone fruits and toffee finish long. This ranks as a fun challenge for Spanish wine geeks."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Closed on the nose at first, this wine reventualy reveals black currant and cassis around wrapped tobacco leaf, the midpalate somewhat dry and puckering in tannin. Concentrated and dense, it finishes in dusty mocha."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This new offering is beautifully knit together, framing the ripe raspberry fruit with barrel spices, herbs and a streak of coffee grounds. Immediately appealing, it nonetheless has the weight and structure to be cellared until 2020–2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cassis spritzer and pine tree-like herbals provide a promising start on the nose. It's rich in the mouth, with cherry, blackberry and a nice edge of black pepper."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Pure Cabernet from some of Washington's oldest vines at Champoux and Sagemoor, this is a superb bottle, dense, compact and textural. A full mix of black fruits underscored with clean, moist earth and polished, silky tannins, finishes with pretty barrel flavors of spice and vanilla. Broad, deep and immensely pleasurable."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Hard tannins, dryness and oakiness are the three horsemen that mark this young, vital Cabernet. Is it ageworthy? Absolutely. Once the fruit kicks in, which is pretty much instantly, it's devastatingly rich and spicy in blackberries, blueberries and cassis. Clearly a cellar candidate for at least the next decade."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Cab is drinking very dry, tannic and austere in its youth. It really needs time in the cellar to soften and throw some sediment, and allow the heart of black currants and dark chocolate to emerge. Should begin to show interest after 2013."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The Rutherford grapes that go into this wine travel down to Santa Barbara post-harvest, a journey that doesn't diminish the wine's sense of place. It represents its dusty provenance well amid a taste of sanguine tannins, soy sauce and ripe plum."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"As expected, this wine's vines are next to a gravel quarry in Paarl, a region known for producing powerful reds. Big flavors of black currant and berry are balanced by a poised acidity and spicy wood character, and while assertive, the wine maintains an elegant, dry reserve. Drink now or wait 2–3 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine is supremely pretty, inviting in rose petals and violets. Sourced from Oakville Ranch Vineyard and Vineyard Georges III in Rutherford, it deserves its own bottling. Generously soft and complex, it offers a deftness of black cherry, clove and cedar married expertly together."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A brittle, peppery and ultimately disappointing wine, this 100% varietal lacks the smoothness and cherry-herb complexities you expect from a fine Rutherford Cab. Finishes sharp and dry."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a sharp, high-toned Cabernet, which begins with nail polishy aromas and some cherry candy flavors, then quickly tails off. It lacks both depth and detail, making it difficult to understand what merits the reserve designation."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Hard-edged aromas of cheesy oak, leather, wiry berry fruits and graphite are a bit hot when totaled up. Tight, fresh and juicy on the palate, this tastes of currant, plum and vanilla. A finish with heavy but integrated oak as well as residual heat and burn says drink through 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Somewhat murky and smelling of compost and green berry fruit. Feels full and wide, with a hard palate containing milk chocolate and molasses flavors. Finishes bitter, dark and herbal, with gripping tannins. Tasted twice."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Earthy, complex aromas of coffee, mocha, cherry and cassis set the stage for a fresh, clean mouthfeel and deep, satisfying flavors of cherry, chassis and spice. A toasty finish with mocha, herb and black-fruit flavors is in sync. Drink through 2021."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"While dense on the palate with bold alcohol and big tannins, crisp black plum and cassis flavors show pristinely on the palate of this Cabernet Sauvignon. Hints of tobacco leaf, bramble and sweet spice lend a lingering warmth to the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a classic Napa Valley floor Cabernet, enhanced with handfuls of Petit Verdot and Merlot. Dusty in red currant and herb, it offers mellowed tannins and a peppery underbelly."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Cabernet is immediately succulent, with smooth tannins, gorgeous layers of oak, and intricate flavors of blackberries, black cherries, plums and mocha. The alcohol is high, giving this 100% Cabernet some heat, but it should pair well with char-broiled steak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A good Cabernet, with pleasantly ripe blackberry, cherry and currant flavors, as well as a nice coating of sweet oak. Feels a little rugged in the mouth, with some edgy tannins. Give it a couple hours of decanting before service."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This 100% varietal wine opens with beautifully lush aromas of blackberry and licorice, before a seamless, soft layering of leather comes in. Soft tannins mark the midpalate, followed by a finish steeped in smoky vanilla and herb."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Juicy and pungent aromas of grape candy, black-cherry blossoms and smoking pipe tobacco jump out of the glass on this easy drinker. It's showy on the palate with blackberry, black currant and tart red cherries, gaining depth from licorice and dill. It's both boisterous and complex."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"So rich and ripe in fruit, you almost don't notice that it's also a complicated and layered wine in structure. Blackberry marmalade, cassis and cocoa flavors are balanced despite hefty alcohol. An extraordinarily delicious wine, but it's meant to be enjoyed in its youth. Drink up by 2016."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"It's not often that you see Charbono in a Cabernet bottling, but it works. This wine boasts aromas of ripe cassis, red cherry and woody chocolate. The tannins are pronounced and chalky, giving a full mouthfeel, with sharp flavors of tart cherry and a strong acidity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine's aromas are locked up but still show nuance, with fresh herb, flower, vanilla, chocolate and cherry notes. The palate shows restraint despite the warm region and vintage, with firm, lightly dry tannins providing support. It shows well at the dinner table."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There aren't many Cabernet Sauvignons from Napa County at this price point, so this one stands out for its concentration and simple cherry, clove and vanilla flavors wrapped in smoky oak. Perfumed and crisp with acidity, it's food-friendly and ready to be enjoyed."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"At the age of nearly five years, this Cab is at a stage where it won't develop further. It' a softly tannic wine, with simple berry-cherry and oak flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Simple and direct, this wine is characterized by flavors of blackberry, currant, mocha and oak. It's a softly tannic Cabernet with a large production of 48,000 cases. Dry and spicy, it's ready to drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"True to the Schug style, this is dry, earthy and less flamboyant than many of today's Cabs. But it's also elegant, and its modesty wants to support food, not overwhelm it. With its finely delineated black currants, anise, dried herbs and oak, it's a lovely wine to drink now, and should gain traction over the next 5–6 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is the priciest Cab Ca' Momi has released in years, but it's also the best. It's soft, complex and delicious in black currants, chocolate and oak, with wonderfully smooth tannins, and just enough acidity for balance. It's clearly decadent for drinking now through 2020. Beyond that, all bets are off."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This rooty smelling wine delivers herb, cola and cassis aromas in front of a wiry feeling palate that's loaded to the brim with hard-biting tannins. Flavors of mossy, baked berry fruits come with an herbal streak, and the finish is hard due to those grating tannins. For a five-year-old wine to feel this hard is telling."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A great value Cabernet that's earthy and direct, this has just enough flavors of red and black cherry and tobacco, with soft tannins that keep the wine interesting through the long, slightly spicy finish. There are handfuls of estate-grown Petit Verdot, Petite Sirah, Merlot and Malbec in the mix. Pair it with hamburgers."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The aromas are all high toned, with notes of coffee, herb and cherry. The elegantly styled flavors are well balanced and carry through on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is pure Cabernet from Red Mountain's Klipsun vineyard; there is nothing subtle or gentle about this wine. It's a powerhouse, sharp and astringent, with edgy flavors of berry and granite. The rock/mineral component dominates the finish, which lingers and gently fades. Overall, this is a wine to cellar and to watch; it tastes like a high-altitude Malbec from a 7,000-foot Argentine vineyard."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Very fine and high-toned, a Cabernet that shows real class and pedigree. Entirely drinkable now for its soft, lush tannins and elaborately detailed blackberry, black cherry, anise, carob and cedar flavors that last long through a spicy finish. Should age well through 2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"With 10% Malbec, this estate red is lightly spiced with clove and cinnamon notes, while fresh cherry and blackberry flavors develop on the palate. Moderate in tannin and oak, it reveals its balance as it opens."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This fruity wine is light in texture. It has gentle tannins, with bitterness and a stalky character that brings out the acidity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Strong and direct in licorice, cassis, cocoa and smoky cedar flavors, the wine is balanced with adequate acids. It's also thoroughly dry, a good thing. Could use a bit more polish in the tannic structure, which is on the jagged side. Decant, or age for two or three years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine is made to highlight the vintage and best vineyards, relying heavily on the producer's top-end site, Sacrashe. A hugely constructed wine, bold and brawny, it also manages to be soft and velvety, allowing for a greater contribution of savory elements than sweet, from leather to black pepper to Mexican chocolate. It pushes the boundaries on decadence in mysterious ways."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tough and earthy, with gritty tannins framing tobacco, black cherry and oak flavors. A good everyday Cab from this warmish appellation."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A fairly light, juicy, fruity wine, this has generic flavors, smooth texture, medium body, light tannins and a ripe taste on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Here's a plush and straightforward wine that would pair well with braised brisket or lamb. Flavors of berry compote and all-fruit preserves are upfront, while a milk-chocolate accent unfolds on the medium-length finish. Soft tannins and a silky texture make this a wine that's easy to enjoy now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's not a ton of assertive character to this wine aside from its gripping tannins and firm structure. The fruit is faint and shy, with notes of dark berries, black tea and licorice spice hiding in the background. Open well in advance, give it a good decant, or try cellaring for another couple of years before drinking."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This broad-shouldered, full-bodied wine shocks and awes with its clove and black pepper notes that are as savory as a fine steak, with which it would pair brilliantly. Oak and tannin form a shield of power that girds the black fruit for further battle."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Spicy, peppery cherry and plum aromas precede a medium-bodied palate with grip but not much depth. This tastes warm and spicy, with driving berry flavors. A fresh, lightly woody finish fits the wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine doesn't fully come together, with a somewhat uncomfortable mixture of grapy aromas, wood and herbs. It's medium bodied with cherry flavors and grainy tannins, trailing toward the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A solid, good Cabernet, with very ripe, extracted blackberry, blueberry and chocolate flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. It's a little forward and obvious now, and will take a few years of cellaring."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from a number of hillside and valley floor vineyards, including Beckstoffer Georges III, this still-developing wine is delicately layered in soft-grained tannins, a dusty, graphite spark around the mellow red fruit and anise. With a lingering finish, it ends with a touch of dust. Cellar through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Here's a big, fruity Cabernet. It's marked with strong blackberry, cherry and cocoa flavors that are almost candied, but the finish is dry and smooth. Tastes a bit simple now, but could develop beyond 2011."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lots of acidity in this still-young Cabernet, giving the blackberry and cassis flavors a real bite that accentuates the tannins. It's tough now despite the richness, but doesn't have the stuffing for aging, so drink now with rich fare to balance the acids."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cedar, black currants, prune and tobacco aromas unfold in the glass. The warm, forward palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice, black pepper and tobacco alongside astringent tannins. While the tannins need to unwind, it's shy on fresh acidity and the fruit is starting to dry up—a result of the hot vintage—so drink sooner rather than later."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Cinnamon and licorice gumdrop and sketchy cherry cough drop aromas make up the nose on this cloying Cab that also shows hard tannins. Baked berry and brown sugar flavors finish with little sizzle or balance.
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rich in cassis and black peppercorn, grapes for this wine came from Stagecoach Vineyard as well as other Napa Valley superstar sources. It delivers layers of medium-weight blackberry and currant fruit, developed tannins and a signature taste of dusty minerals and rock. Small amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot are blended in."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From the producer's Yountville vineyard, as well as sites in Rutherford and Calistoga, this Cab-based blend is grippy and herbal, rustic in baked bread, cassis and cedar. Full bodied, it finishes in thick, leathery tannin."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Herbal in cedar, this medium-bodied wine is simply layered, with a thickness of tannin and oak, its mouthfeel substantial yet smooth. Black fruit speaks loudest—a mix of black cherry, blueberry and blackberry jam."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Chocolate milk, with a squeeze of cassis liqueur and the sweet vanillins of toasted oak, are the flavors. With the high alcohol, it's almost a dessert wine. Give it credit for a heady opulence."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Berry aromas take on a savory and animal hide note. The dense palate carries herbal and earthy flavors, with mulchy, stalky berry tones that come with a dash of coffee grinds. An earthy finish is suggestive of fresh compost."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Truffle and dirt arise aromatically from this wine, a structured and juicy offering of red and black berry, tobacco and black tea. Lush and complex, the wine jumps from the glass and is a nice example of the beauty that can be coaxed from a challenging vintage."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is an inky-black wine, with soft, jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, dark chocolate and oak. The tannins are mountain thick but as refined as modern winemaking can make them. And the finish? Sweet and dry at the same time, which only a good wine can accomplish. Needs 5–7 years in the cellar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Shows all the hallmarks of a modern Napa wine of high quality. Although it's quite dry, it's rich in crushed ripe blackberries, in good alignment with smoky new oak. The tannins are smooth and complex, the acidity just fine. Really a lovely bottle of red wine, although a touch of superripeness may limit ageability."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft, smoky oak permeates this full-bodied wine, with light clove and cinnamon accents. The rich layers of blackberry and black currant fruit are complemented by mocha notes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"With 22% Merlot blended, it's direct and appealing with notes of black tea, cherry, leafy greens and bittersweet chocolate. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a pleasing sense of balance and a slightly gritty feel to the tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Acidity hits the palate like a shard of glass, immediately followed by rich, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cassis and spices. The tannins are strong, too. All the parts simply have not come together. Will it age well? It's not a slam dunk."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This county-derived Cabernet is plush and pronounced in big, smoky tannins. A taste of berry pie evens things out, before a long, dry finish. It's a good pick for larger gatherings."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Gritty rubbery aromas are slightly acrid, like asphalt. This is standard in feel, with generic berry flavors. Herbal spice and mild heat control the finish. Beyond that, there's not much to say about this simple Cab."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine was sent to me with little information about the owners, and their Web Site doesn't reveal much. The paperwork says it's from Knights Valley, although the label reads Sonoma County. It's a dry, fairly tannic wine, quite ripe in currants and dark chocolate, with an herbal edge and a firm structure. Aged in 100% new French oak, it impresses for its richness and depth, and could develop over the next 6–8 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"CSM's mainstream Cabernet Sauvignon now carries a “100% vinifera rootstock” designation—surely a first for any American winery. It displays more structure than some of the other, similarly priced offerings from the Northwest's largest winery group. With good focus and length, its mix of plum and berry fruit, nicely set in a frame of toast, coffee and charred wood, makes it a surefire, all-purpose, medium-bodied red."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Plum, spice and sweet herb aromas lead to rounded blue-fruit flavors surrounded by dry, astringent tannins that are unyielding."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Ripe fleshy blackberry and plum notes are pristine and pretty in this richly textured Cabernet Sauvignon. It's densely concentrated on the palate, but brisk acidity and glimmers of violet, lavender and graphite lend levity and freshness. Approachable already yet regal with fine firm tannins, it's ready to drink now but should continue to improve for at least another decade."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Red licorice, rhubarb and green herb aromas are balanced by toast, spice and berry notes. The palate feels hard and dense, with herbal berry and olive flavors. Chocolate and additional herbal flavors carry the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft, fruity, dry and hot, with jammy cherry and raspberry flavors, touched with smoky oak. If you like this high alcohol style, the wine is for you."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The winery does not give us exact new oak statistics, but oak dominates the aroma and flavor of this Cab. Beyond the caramel, smoke and toasty vanilla meringue, the blackberry and currant flavors are a little thin."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Simple berry aromas are generic. This is dark on the palate, with black-fruit flavors that are standard and don't show much character. A lightly toasted finish is solid and not too choppy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This dark-purple Cab is full of berry, horse hide and cola aromas. It's full bodied and chunky, with herbal, mossy flavors of buttery oak, salty berry and earth. A salinic, briny flavor lingers on the beefy finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This new project from the heights of Atlas Peak involves Steve Matthiasson as both viticulturist and winemaker, having had to take over the reins from the late Denis Malbec. It shines in bristling acidity, dusty tannin and a beautiful floral aroma of violet. Notes of chocolate, fig and cigar sit atop a pillowy, complex structure, while vanilla lingers on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Chocolaty and spicy, loaded with cinnamon and anise, and backed by sturdy plum-flavored fruit. The mouthfeel is creamy and rich; the finish, long and oaky."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From grapes grown in Pope Valley, the eastern part of the Napa Valley, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with 2% Petit Verdot. Smoky bacon and thick, concentrated waves of blackberry mark the wine, which is made by Ted Osborne of Olabisi. The finish is dark and chocolaty, with more of that smoke."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The tannins stand front and center in this mountain wine, but they're so finely textured, you hardly notice them. They glide over the palate, carrying along ultraripe blackberry flavors. A firm grounding of minerals provides additional structure. This rich Cabernet should develop bottle complexity over the next eight years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"More powerful and potent than the '04, this simply has more juice, more depth, more power and more detail than any previous Sheridan wine. The fruit is exceptional—dense black cherry and cassis, with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way. It already has the balance, the polish and the length to justify long-term cellaring. Tannins are ripe and supple, bringing in hints of dried herb and black olive."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A light wine, in color, texture and flavor. It has simple blackberry and oak flavors, and is priced right."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine starts out reduced before opening to reveal aromas of earth, peat, pencil lead and dark fruit. Dark plum and black-olive flavors show concentration and sophistication, with the barrel influence dialed way back. It's an intriguing example of the variety. Give it a short decant."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sourced largely from the Martin Stelling Vineyard, this is a supple, soft wine, with refined tannins. A zippy nose of rose and spice scents paves the way for more powerful leather saddle, cedar and black tea elements. Its fruit is wild and brambly, recalling blackberry and dark cherry with enviable succulence."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a jammy, dense and pure Cabernet, with meat and berry aromas that mix in touches of graphite and chocolate. It feels a little hard and acidic despite its size, while the flavor profile is of mossy berry fruit and chocolate. Tight and nervy, this offers lots of acidic push on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Grapey and foxy, with green, minty aromas and a hollow center. The palate is bulky, heavy and tannic, while the flavors are strained and grapey. Sweet and incomplete; grapey but not in harmony."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A monumental Cabernet that succeeds on every level. It's deep, dark and ultrarich, showing massive blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, violets, minerals and a touch of sweet, smoky oak. Beyond the flavors is the dramatic structure, with fabulously ripe, dense tannins and a bone-dry, long finish. Surely a tremendous wine capable of long-term aging. Try 2012–2018, at least."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This sources grapes from the oldest (1972) blocks at Sagemoor, yielding a deep, rich and intense wine saturated with black cherry, cassis, licorice and barrel flavors. It's perfectly balanced, drinking beautifully, and fit for cellaring over a decade or longer."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a limited-production line from this venerable winery. It's a very dense, focused Cab, a little too tightly wound to pop the cork quite yet. There's a sharp pine or balsam zinginess that's a combination of smoky oak and deeply ripe cassis, fresh and zesty and dry. The wine needs time for all this to mellow. Best after 2008, and for a decade beyond."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Decadently ripe, this voluptuous Cabernet Sauvignon brims with fleshy black-plum and berry flavors. Touches of green pepper and stem add a bit of contrast to all the richness, and subtle notes of spice and bramble tones lend complexity as well. Despite its brawn, it's a neatly balanced wine kept in check by crisp cranberry tones and a fine-grained tannin structure."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Similar in style and aging potential to the winery's 2009, and blended with amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot, this Cabernet Sauvignon from mighty Howell Mountain is rich in spicy blackberry and clove, the tannins soft and juicy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A bit sharp and rubbery at first, with herbal, floral, berry aromas rising up in due time. The palate is a little rigid, with angular acidity and semitart raspberry and red currant flavors. Lightly toasted on the finish even if there's not much oak on this regular, competent CS."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Cabernet opens with lush mocha and coffee scents, and is a soft, well-rounded wine with well-rounded fruit flavors. Small amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot are included in the blend."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Ridge's historic Monte Bello estate produces black tobacco, wet slate, chalk and blueberry jam aromas in this vintage. The wine, which gets support from 14% Merlot-3% Petite Verdot-1% Cabernet Franc, is not very dense and even racy on the palate, with violet, cola, tart cranberry and darker fruit as well."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vanilla, cherry, cedar, pipe smoke and violet extracts swirl into a rather amazing nose on this wine from the Gallo-owned producer. The black cherry-dominated palate is lifted by baking soda minerality, and the tannins are present but not intrusive."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"At about six years of age, this Bordeaux blend is soft, fruity and ending its useful lifespan. The cherry and cola flavors are drying out. Drink up."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Classically styled Barossa Cabernet, with plenty of weight and texture, its rich chocolate and cassis aromas and flavors backed by just a touch of mint. Finishes long, with velvety tannins that should begin to settle by 2010 and keep it evolving through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A potpourri of dried sage, gunpowder, black pepper and leather provide a robust, full-bodied and brawny experience in this wine crafted from vineyards across the valley. It has black fruit flavors and a savory personality wrapped in big, sturdy tannins that should mellow in due time. Drink now through 2023."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Inviting raspberry and cherry aromas have a tiny level of volatility, while the palate is chunky, bold and edgy, with big berry flavors leading the way. Full on the finish, with some oak and vanilla to give it padding. Lively, full-bodied Cabernet that's pretty good in the long run."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Bold, succulent black cherry and currant flavors combine with softer, more elegant notions of graphite, coffee and clove in this well-made, full-bodied, 100% varietal wine. Volcanic soils comprise the Sonoma Mountain slope where the vineyard is located, contributing a gravelly hint of reduction."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dark and dense in chocolate and coconut macaroon, this soft, approachable wine is made to serve as the winery's flagship offering. Layered in dark, ripe plum and cherry, as well as flecks of sweet tobacco, it reflects the region well, offering subtle power and finesse."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A little browning at the rim combined with stewy and baked aromas confirm age. Oaking shines through with notes of char, cedar, and smoke over meaty-tasting, but thin fruit and dried herbs."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Plum, dill, oregano, pencil lead, tobacco and woody berry aromas show on the nose of this bottling. Light in body and flavor, the palate offers leather, tobacco, dried berry and plum-skin elements."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a seductive wine, concentrated and full bodied and entirely big. Black cherry, chocolate and blackberry jam ride the palate with authority, as soft tannins wrap around the bold flavor."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Ripe and fruity, this has an oak flavor that overshadows the blackberries and currants."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There are solid Cabernet flavors of blackberries and black currants in this dry, tannic wine. It's rough and astringent in the mouth, without much charm, but a rich steak, maybe topped with a gorgonzola sauce, will make it shine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dark and leathery up front, with a dusting of nutmeg and sawdust. Feels a bit grabby and resiny, but it's boasting enough acidity to push things through. Flavors of cassis, berry and herbs are normal and nice, while the finish is warm and chunky. Good Cabernet for the price."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"It took Vina Robles some years to figure Cabernet out, but they did it. The Huerhuero now is one of Paso's best bottlings, at a fair price. Dry and sufficient in acidity, its blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors are comparable to a fine Napa Cab. Drink over the next few years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Ripe and rich on the nose with a harmonious black fruit and sweet vanilla bean aroma, this Virginia Cab is clean and pure with a remarkably pristine fruit profile. Bright and fresh with balanced acidity and a nicely concentrated midpalate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From a 25-acre site on the western flank of Rutherford, this wine includes 2% Malbec. With sanguine cassis, cranberry and cinnamon touches, it's a soft, round and velvety expression of the hearty variety, finishing with notes of coffee and dark chocolate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cranberry and red currant are the stars of the show in this mountain wine, which is further accented in dried herb and lavender. Tart, tangy acidity supports firm pillowy tannins with a robust ripeness and lingering notes of leather and tobacco leaf."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Made entirely with Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of toasted oak, scorched earth, underbrush and a balsamic whiff of eucalyptus. The dense palate offers blackberry jam, licorice, cured meat and a confectionery note alongside chewy, close-grained tannins. It's a bit shy on freshness, so drink sooner rather than later."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rich in blackberry jam and chocolate, this wine offers a wealth of dusty underbelly and tightly wound tannin and toasted oak. Around those richer rewards are brighter elements of cassis and currant, finished in zippy acidity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Right now this is a big, tough Cabernet. It's very dry and oaky, and the black and red cherry flavors have a jammy edge. Despite the apparent simplicity, you find yourself returning to it, a good sign that suggests complex ageability. Give it 4–6 years in a cool cellar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is made to be a reserve-level wine, crafted from a combination of blocks within the famous vineyard. Succulent boysenberry and blackberry impress from first sip, before a juiciness of cherry and strawberry pile in. Expansive and powerful, with tremendous body and texture, it ends with a persistence of black pepper. Drink now through 2023."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"An inky-deep color with a dark red rim hints at the concentration. Enticing aromas from the spice rack, milk chocolate and vanilla lead to meltingly rich fruit and cocoa flavors that are deep and focused. At first sip it's almost sweet with ripe black cherry and black currant notes, but the vivid acidity and layer of fine tannins keep it dry and balanced. It will be best after 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of black plum, black cherry, green bramble and a touch of eucalyptus precede flavors of blackberry, raspberry and red plum."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Already showing some signs of age in its slightly browning rim, this Cab boasts scents of eucalyptus, vanilla, cinnamon and red cherries, but it's all overly delicate-almost lacy. There's just not enough there to score higher despite its charms."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Being 100% varietal, aromas of barrel spice are prominent at present, followed by black fruit. The fruit flavors are sweet but still lighter in style, with lightly grainy tannins backing them up. It's surprisingly restrained considering the warmth of the vintage and region."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A blend of Mount Barker and Margaret River fruit, this is lavishly oaked, chocolaty and rich, as decadent a bottle of Cabernet you'll find in Australia. Baking spices accent mocha and cassis in this full-bodied wine, which features a velvety texture and long finish. Drink 2020–2030, and possibly beyond."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The “X” designation refers to the number of clones in this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. You have to search for the richness—buried so deeply now—but it's there, like a pirate treasure of blackberries, black currants and cassis liqueur. Hard, thick and resistant now, it's framed by astringent tannins and a dryness that's almost arid. Charles Krug clearly built this wine to age, and there's no reason it shouldn't. Your window begins in 2018 and should last a very long time."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lush and ripe, made in the modern California cult style of flamboyantly sweet blackberries, cassis and chocolate, soft tannins and immediate appeal. Defines richness and opulence, if not complexity. Drink now–2014."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This single-vineyard wine is given added concentration and strength via 14% Petit Verdot. Juicy, soft and plush in black fruit and tar, it tangles on the palate in generous oak, with a thread of black licorice and a shot of espresso."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a big but balanced expression of Cabernet that is ready to drink now. Layers of black cherry, caramel, vanilla, smoke and crushed black rocks show on the lavish nose. The palate's chalky texture is immediately apparent, with vibrant acidity that carries forth a rich crème de cassis flavor and finishes on roasted coffee and milk chocolate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A nice Cabernet for everyday usage largely because it's balanced, mild and under total control. The nose is pure red fruits with a touch of leather, while the palate is snappy, alert and full of tight, almost narrow cherry flavors and fine tannins. Dry and light on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"While plush blackberry, dried fig and cherry aromas are rich and ripe on the nose, this voluptuous Cab is surprisingly structured and taut on the palate. It's rich and luscious in red fruit yet firmly anchored with cranberry acidity and a fine firm fringe of tannins. It's amply lavished in vanilla, spice and toast, but wears these embellishments well."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mildly pickled red-fruit aromas fail to convey freshness or ripeness, and so it's no surprise that the core flavors are a bit herbal and briney. Decent mouthfeel helps it along, while the finish is short and borders on medicinal."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This structured, generously full-bodied wine offers deep layers of black raspberry and cinnamon, with an additional length of subtle black pepper and leather. It builds strength toward the finish before finishing surprisingly light and balanced."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dry, dustily tannic and somewhat closed down, this Cabernet clearly wants some time in the cellar. It has rich, juicy blackberry and cherry flavors, but the tannins and acidity close in fast, locking them down and making the wine astringent and tart. Give it a few years, or decant if you're opening it now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Cab is about fruit and oak, sculpted together with precision and lusciousness. Flavors of blackberries, cherries, licorice, toast and exotic spice flood the mouth, leading to a long finish. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Massive, dramatic, beautiful, intense, but young and firm in tannins, with a cut of fresh acidity. Shows concentrated blackberries, black currants, violets, minerals and cedar, leading to a long, penetrating finish. Very great Cabernet, vibrant and potent, just tremendous in structure. Potentially a near-perfect wine with 4–6 years in the bottle."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a rich, well-structured Cabernet, but such are the tannins that it needs time in the cellar. The cool vintage was kind to the Calistoga fruit, keeping the alcohol modest and the tannins hefty, while allowing the grapes to develop intense flavors of blackberry and black currant. Give it 6–8 years in a good cellar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This 100% varietal wine from a young, emerging vineyard was aged in mixture of new French (86%) and American oak. It's aromatically brooding with notes of dark coffee, vanilla, dark cherry, herbs and chocolate. The polished black fruit flavors are rich yet light on their feet with the tannins combed to a fine sheen and mouthwatering acids. Best from 2020–2027."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Solid dark-berry aromas are dense and deep. This has a plump forward fruity palate with concentrated, toasty flavors of blackberry and dark plum. On the finish, this remains fruity and compact, with more than enough body weight."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From a somewhat difficult vintage, Stephen and Prue Henschke have turned out a wonderful Cab. Eucalyptus, tobacco and cherry aromas lead the way, followed by flavors that add a deep undercurrent of cassis. It's a big, thickly textured wine, with a long, berry-inflected finish. Not that tannic, it should nevertheless drink well through at least 2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Despite being six years old, this is still kicking. The nose is raw and stewy, but it's also ripe and rubbery, with cassis and berry aromas. The palate is thick, bulky and chunky, with heavy, chewy berry fruit flavors in front of a slightly baked finish. One-dimensional but not bad for Argentine Cab."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Pure Cabernet, aged in the same Vicard barrels as winemaker Randy Dunn's Howell Mountain wines. About 90% is new oak, but it doesn't strangle the fruit in any way. Tart and vibrant, with black cherry/black currant fruit, this balanced effort shows a velvety character and a fine touch in the vineyard. Nuances of coffee, earth, leaf and dried herb are threaded through, in perfect harmony and balanced for medium-term aging."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Attractive scents of whole clove and cinnamon stick add depth to the black fruit core of this wine. Lush, ripe flavors of blackberry, boysenberry and cassis flood the medium-weight palate, with medium tannins and notes of cigar box and licorice that remain through the medium-length finish. Drink now–2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Given three years of barrel age and another in bottle, this mature wine offers baked fruit, cedar, clove and red-currant flavors, sizably robust in texture and weight. Thick tannins provide it with additional density."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"It's all about ripe, jammy blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate in this soft, tannic Cabernet. The alcohol is noticeable for the heat it gives, and the finish is rich with glycerols. Drink soon."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a good, sound Cabernet. The blackberry and cherry fruit is candy-jammy, with an oaky overlay."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine—named for two adjacent vineyards—is 75% Dionysus Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Bacchus Cabernet Franc. It provides a pleasing assortment of dried and fresh herbs, cherry, flowers and mocha with a seamless, almost creamy feel, bringing an impeccable sense of balance. It's irresistible now but has the stuffing to go the distance."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is one of those wines that grows more attractive the more it airs in the glass. At first, it just impresses with ripe blackberry and cassis fruit and lots of oak. As it breathes, subtler notes emerge, lending it charm and complexity. Still, it remains quite tannic. High alcohol may limit ageability, so drink it over the next few years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Opens with pointed red fruit aromas as well as an herbal/green infusion. Feels grating and scratchy, with red currant, plum and milk chocolate flavors. Finishes with buttery oak and vanilla. Pretty much your standard fare Chilean Cab."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"What a fine, beautiful wine this is. Shows every graceful aspect of a modern Napa Cab, from the perfectly ripened fruit to the unbelievably fine tannins and application of oak. Thrills the mouth with decadently rich black currants, crême de cassis, milk chocolate, anise and cedar flavors, but never loses an impeccable sense of balance and control. Best now, even without decanting, and through 2014."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This dark-looking Cabernet smells chunky, raisiny and earthy. In the mouth, it's dense and extracted but blocky and heavy. Roasted oaky blackberry flavors finish with tannic residue and an oak-based flavor of clove."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A little on the soft side, but very dry, with smoky oak and blackberry fruit dominating. Feels good and chewy and rich, with interesting herb and spice notes. Will age for a few years, but not for a long time. Give it a good decant."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Quite condensed and woody, with brier and sawdust aromas and some vivacious berry fruit. The palate is deep and pure, with cherry and cassis along with hints of coffee and earth. Yes, it's a bit hard due to firm tannins, but it's also a complete wine with a long, overt finish. Best Buy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The deep red-black color reaches from core to rim. The fragrant nose centers around hot chocolate and candied cherries. Dry on the attack with adequate acidity, the wine shows moderate extraction and medium alcohol that lead to a short finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine has a dark color, classic cedar and black currant aromas, ripe fruit flavors and firm tannins along with raspberry-like acidity. It has been well-sculpted with barrel age—polishing any rough tannic edges—and will taste great with a thick steak or chop."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lightly herbal and light in body, with earthy aromas that include leather, tea and dried fruits. This is medium-bodied in style, with elegance. Problem is, there isn't much substance to it and compared to Chile's better Cabs, it pales in flavor and generosity. Also, the finish is kind of scratchy and thin."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dark in color, this powerful and concentrated wine is still very young. There is possibly too much extraction here that shows in bitterness, but the wine also has the potential for aging with its rich underlying fruitiness. Don't drink before 2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A terrific Cabernet that gives all the richness and opulence you expect in an expensive Napa Cab, yet controls it with firm tannins, acidity, minerals and earthiness. Explosive in blackberry and cherry-pie filling and chocolate granola-bar flavors that are so delicious, you can't stop reaching for another glass. The grapes come 100% from the winery's Atlas Peak appellation vineyard."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This shows classic Cabernet Sauvignon character, and there's even a Bordeaux-like earthiness that grounds the cherry, currant and cedar flavors. Made from fruit grown in the winery's Alexander Valley vineyard, this is ideal for drinking now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Big, baked and round on the nose, with leather and sweet blackberry aromas. Put it on the scale and it'll weigh in as heavy. The flavors are dark and cooked as it centers on black plum and blackberry. Short on finesse but long on size, with coffee and chocolate on the finish. Drink now before it turns even softer."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Shows the difficulties of making Cabernet succeed in this Santa Barbara County inland valley. It's awkward, with sweet blackberry and bell pepper flavors swamped with oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rooty aromas of tree bark, cola, tobacco and sweet briar set up a plump, tannic palate with roasted, sweet flavors of Mission fig, dark berry and spice. It's easygoing and loamy on the finish, with chewy tannins and not too much bite."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Pure varietal and estate grown, this opens with pretty fruit flavors of cherry and red plum. Aging in one-quarter new French oak adds a pleasing toasty note, along with a hint of dark chocolate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A bit on the light, herbal side, but elegant and balanced, showing tobacco and sage-infused blackberry and cherry flavors. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lots of rich, heady flavors in this delicious young Cabernet Sauvignon. It appeals now for the intense blackberry, cherry, cassis, dark chocolate and anise flavors, but such is the tannic intensity that it should easily age. Hold until 2015 and try again."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Very tough in tannins now, and bone dry, but it's not showing the richness you want for it to survive time in the cellar. Some modest blackberry flavors, which turn into black currants and cocoa toward the finish, relieve the austerity. But it doesn't seem likely to improve."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"In the blend are small portions of 6% Syrah, 3% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc—winemaker Mike Wade is a meticulous blender—and the nuanced character is immediately apparent. Seductive scents mix black cherry, nutmeg and toffee, leading into rich red and black fruits, licorice and smoke. Just a hint of earth and herb highlight the lightly tannic finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine has the solid tannins the mountain is known for, and ripe flavors of blackberries, currants, cherries and chocolate, enriched with new oak. At twenty bucks, and with a low production, it's a stunning value. With real elegance and even ageworthiness, it's one of the best at its price point available now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Drawing from prestigious vineyard sources that include Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge and Alder Ridge, this generous Cabernet is redolent with notes of cherry, cocoa, herbs and dusty spices. The broad, tart cherry flavors are supported with a firm tannic structure that will keep this wine ageing nicely in the cellar for years to come."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Reserved aromas of flowers, anise, plum and barrel spice lead to compact fruit and tannins with mouthwatering acids. Give it time to open up."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A beautiful, ultrafine Cabernet that shows rich blackberry, black currant, violet, cocoa and cedar flavors, and while it has tightly wound mountain tannins, it's entirely approachable now. A great, delicious success that's capable of aging for a good ten years, in a proper cellar. From the Davies family, of Schramsberg."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A widely available offering from Concannon, this Cab is rich in jammy cherry and vanilla, with a backbone of oak, a nice choice for midweek dinners of rib roast and steak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Full of blackberry, black currant and oak flavors all wrapped into smooth, firm tannins, this is a pleasant Cab to drink now and for the next few years. It's as complex as any Cabernet you can find at this price in Napa Valley."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Olmaia (100% Cabernet Sauvignon) delivers power and intensity with interwoven tones of ripe fruit, spice, forest floor and leather. The wine exhibits a rich and smooth texture that helps drive it along the palate in a soft and very pleasurable manner."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This 100% Cabernet shows a ripeness level that few Cabs in the world are able to achieve. It's awesomely rich in blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam, cassis liqueur and mocha flavors, with new oak influences. Drink it over the next four years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The nose is slightly creamy due to overt oak, and it's also somewhat disjointed, what with both bold berry fruit and a strong whiff of wet dog. In the mouth, things quickly turn grapey, and then that overt fruitiness morphs into cherry and espresso. Meanwhile, bursting acidity throughout keeps it lively and fresh. Best Buy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Massive fruity extract characterizes this Cabernet. With noble tannins and explosive black currant, cassis and dark chocolate flavors, it defines the modern Napa cult style of soft, delicious complexity. Good to go now, but you're better off holding it for 8–12 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Bright fruit, mildly creamy, with good zest and acidity. Shows a sweet, savory center with hints of brown sugar and spice sitting along the edges. Easy tannins make it a friendly style; good for near-term drinking. No cellaring necessary."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Yeasty, like baked bread, this thick, leathery and peppery wine is surrounded by a wealth of burly tannins. The oak well integrated, it will nonetheless benefit from further aging to coax more of its dark raspberry and blackberry fruit. Cellar through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sanguine in cranberry and strawberry, this robust wine holds back on the tannin and oak, weaving their stronger tendencies into waves of bittersweet chocolate and black tea. Medium to full-bodied, it's both classic and flush with ripe California fruit."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The nose on this bottling from the pioneering regional winery, now run by its namesake's son, is lush and dynamic, with black cherry, cola and vanilla-laced pie crust on the nose. Finely polished tannins carry very smooth flavors of blackberry, soy-driven umami, crushed graphite, light cedar and a pinch of herbs."
Cabernet Sauvignon,The volatiles are quite amped on this wine. It makes it a struggle to get at the tart black cherry flavors.
Cabernet Sauvignon,This is a standard Cabernet Sauvignon that sees oak aging for added layers of spice and toast. At the core is a solid base of red fruit and blackberry with easy endnotes of licorice and dried spice.
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Chocolate-covered raspberry forms the luscious core of this fairly priced wine that's medium-bodied, moderately naked in its oak use and soft in its approachability. Rich, dense and luxurious, it will pair well with any grilled meats."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine is agile and elegant, very firm in texture without being too full-bodied. It smells lightly smoky, slightly herbal and tastes moderately rich as subtle plum and pomegranate flavors transition to richer berry and cocoa notes on the finish. It needs time to show more complexity, so drink after 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vibrant aromas of black plum, cassis, dried leather, licorice and herb lead to full, sweet, soft-feeling dark fruit flavors that linger."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This seductive wine has aromas of mint and cassis leading to deliciously ripe and complex fruit flavors within a creamy texture. While braced by fine-grained tannins, the wine remains almost silky on the palate, bringing cherry, blueberry and mocha flavors that linger on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is an awesome Cabernet. It's 100% varietal, with lots of French oak. It shows blackberry jam, black currant, chocolate and sweet oak flavors that are absolutely delicious. The wine is said to come from the esteemed Morisoli Vineyard, in Rutherford."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This impressive wine dances in hearty clove and cinnamon sparked by a floral bouquet of rose. High-toned, structured and elegant, it has subtle power and concentration but remains fresh in the glass. Drink now through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Wattle Creek has done a good job with Cabernet over the years, and here's another one. I don't think '04 was their best vintage, as the wine is a little raisiny, despite an official alcohol of only 14.1%. But it shows a classy structure, polished dryness and a good depth of varietal black currant fruit, accented with new oak. Probably best now and for a few years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A cranberry-cherry flavor permeates this light-bodied, crisp and fruity wine. The aromas are as bright as the flavors, and it's also lively in texture."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A bit brusque and common in texture, with all kinds of edges. But the blackberry, cherry and mint flavors are rich and interesting. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"An impressive effort at an attractive price, this is a full-bodied wine with an elegant edge. Floral in aroma, it luxuriates in high-toned flavors of cassis and cranberry. Soft and smooth in texture, it's graceful despite its power, and lengthy too."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas lean toward black cherry, chocolate and herbs, which sally forth on the palate serving up more dense fruit, licorice, coffee and beautiful toast flavors. Tannins are smooth, supple and ripe. Long, lush and decadent on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lots to like in this Cabernet, which has ripe, juicy flavors of blackberry, plum, dark chocolate and flashy oak. Made thoroughly in the modern style, it's marked by soft tannins and a certain uniformity. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The aromas of cocoa, woodspice, cassis, cherry and herbs are brooding on this 100% varietal wine that hails from Red Mountain. Palate-coating cherry flavors are supported by dry, lightly gritty tannins and tart acids."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Only the brave and lonely continue to try to forge top Cabernet from Santa Barbara County, especially at this price. While the mission is not impossible, Cabs like this don't advance the cause, no matter how nobly inspired. Dry and herbal, the wine shows only modest blackberry and cherry flavors, and is dry and hard on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Gorgeous, elegant and ageworthy. With a softly tannic structure, it's drinkable now, but should age and gain complexity for 10 years. Dry and smooth, it has complex flavors of blackberries, black cherries, currants, red licorice, cola and oak. Give it some time to breathe. Now–2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This patiently aged wine kicks off with a tremendous nose, blending blackberry, blueberry and dried black cherry with dark chocolate, hearty tobacco, dill, mint, lemon pepper, lavender and raw lamb aromas. The smooth and lasting palate is laced with licorice that carries through flavors of elderberry and dried sour cherries, with chopped sage, exotic dark chocolate and a woody berry element."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Deeply colored, this bottling shows ripe blackberry pie with caramel, crushed graphite and a touch of mint on the nose. The tannins are soft but provide just enough structure to deliver lavish flavors of black cherry, beef char and cedar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This value selection is a no-brainer, with medium tannins providing good structure to the ripe palate. Boysenberry and black currant flavors mingle with spicy accents of hoisin sauce, licorice and coffee bean. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This 100% estate-grown Cabernet carries some of the identifying aromas of the Rocks, a part of Walla Walla where vineyards are planted on a dry river bed. Hints of earth, clay and chocolate make a lively introduction to a wine loaded with cherry and currant fruit flavors. The wine spent 20 months in French oak, but the barrel scents and flavors are handled lightly; the fruit is the star of this show. A fine debut."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This beautiful Cabernet has all the hallmarks of a wine that will go the distance. Tasted in late summer, 2013, at nearly four years of age, it's bright and fresh in black and red currants, mocha, licorice, baking spices and smoky sandalwood. But it's also quite tannic. The balance is superb, though, strongly suggesting further development through at least 2021. Expensive, yes, but it's right up there with Napa's best."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is pure Cabernet that was sourced from four vineyards, with vines averaging 31 years. True noninterventionist winemaking is in play to make this chewy, tight and dark effort.This is grainy and dense, with notes of cassis, coffee and cacao. A thread of smoke and a touch of gravel contribute further to the concentrated finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Fresh-pressed boysenberries give zest to dusty aromas of tobacco and strong shoe leather on the nose of this bottling. Tobacco shows powerfully on the palate, as do dill, marjoram and black pepper. Dark fruit, from blackcurrant to elderberry, provides the base."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A good everyday Cabernet with some aspirations to quality. Even though it's a little rugged and harsh in tannins, it's dry, with oak-inspired flavors of blackberries, black currants, cola and herbs. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The Nugan Vision Cabernet Sauvignon over-delivers for its price point. The fruit expression is bold and ripe, with intense raspberry and blackberry liqueur scents followed by tangy cherry pie filling in the mouth. Ends up on a lingering mocha note. Drink now to 2011."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Smells Porty, like chocolate-covered raisins, and turns rather heavy in the mouth, although very dry. Tastes roasted, with grilled blackberry and cedar flavors. This style is characteristic of the winery and often of this vineyard, on the east side of the Rutherford flatlands."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The Limestone Coast, which encompasses the noted regions of Coonawarra and Padthaway, is known for its Cabernet and its big gum trees. There's certainly more than a bit of mint to this wine, but there are also notes of cassis and even a hint of bell pepper. It does turn a bit astringent on the finish, so pair it with lamb chops or hamburgers. Drink now–2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A good, dry, fleshy wine. Not showing well now in its youth, because it's tannic and unintegrated, with flavors flying all over the place. But there's a solid core of blackberry and black cherry sour candy, a good sign. Give it at least 4–5 years in the cellar, and try again."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Herbal and lean, with hints of sweet charred oak and tart cherries that combine to yield a slightly confected impression on the palate. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Deeply colored, this bottling shows ripe blackberry pie with caramel, crushed graphite and a touch of mint on the nose. The tannins are soft but provide just enough structure to deliver lavish flavors of black cherry, beef char and cedar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Earthy, fairly deep aromas of black fruits and mellow spices come with plenty of oak. In the mouth, this is fresh in feel and medium in body. Flavors of toasty, creamy oak and related vanilla top berry flavors, while the finish is mild, smooth and woody."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This leads with herb, vanilla and plum aromas, along with a reduced note of tire rubber. On the palate, sweet plum flavors are backed by gritty tannins, proving somewhat disjointed."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Blended from all five Bordeaux varieties, this wine has fine, strong flavors of blackberries, black currants and oak, and is dry. The texture, though, is a bit edgy, with jagged tannins and bitter hints of raisins and mint. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dark purple in color, with a creamy, candied, berry fruit nose that's potent but not very stirring. The palate shows concentration, but the flavors don't go beyond the basics: cassis, blackberry and a streak of sourness at the core. Also tannic and tough."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Romanian Cabernet Sauvignon smells like black raspberry, cherry vanilla and a touch of mint. There are flavors of red berries and red plum on the palate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lots of flamboyant blackberry, cherry, raspberry, blueberry and plum fruit flavors in this wine. Almost too much of a good thing. So ripe and opulent, its other qualities, including wonderful tannin structure, seem overshadowed. Difficult to predict where it's going, but right now, it's an orchard in a bottle."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From Canoe Ridge Vineyard, this delivers raspberry, herb, tire rubber and spice aromas and medium-bodied dark fruit flavors. The tannins are a bit dry and pasty."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This 100% varietal wine from both Alexander Valley and Sonoma Valley sites opens in aromas of raspberry, blackberry and vanilla, tangy and stemmy in the background, with a plume of dusty earth."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A full-bodied wine bursting in chocolate and leather, this also displays plenty of cooler vintage and cooler stylistic sensibilities, from jolts of black currant and cedar to a sanguine taste of game in the background. The finish is all about tannic power."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Well-made, well-balanced and medium-bodied, this combines moderate blackberry and black cherry flavors with subtle spicy notes. The texture is tannic enough to be great with food, but smooth enough to enjoy sipping."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Although the bouquet is a touch herbal and raspy, this Cab offers good balance and body in the mouth along with plum, cherry, cassis and spice in moderate measures. A bright, fresh-feeling finish ensures a positive lasting impression."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A blend of various estates from the Paso Robles region, this wine shows roasted pork with blackberry hoisin sauce, black rocks and a touch of dill on the nose. Notable tannins provide lasting structure, with flavors of black olive, tobacco ash, peppercorns, dark chocolate and deep black fruit that will need a tad more time to unravel."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"It's difficult to see how this wine can register alcohol almost 15%. Flavors are thin, green and tannic, with hardly a hint of fruit."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a great project dedicated to and featuring the winery's workers, who are named on the bottles, although the wine itself is a tad sweet. Baked black cherry, licorice and caramel aromas lead to a palate ripe with purple berry and cocoa dust flavors. An easy to quaff and light-bodied red."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine is chock full of freshly crushed black pepper and blackberry jam flavor. It's big in tannins, but large proportions of aging in new French oak gives it hints of toast and a caramelized touch. The wine is disappointing given the bottling's history, but it's likely the chilly vintage that undermined it."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This balanced Cab represents the region and the vintage well, offering velvety soft tannins and components of herb, cassis and raspberry in a long lingering package."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This nearly 100% Cabernet is strongly flavored, bone dry, very tannic and nowhere near ready. It has a tough, astringent mouthfeel, and the concentrated richness of grapes grown on low-yielding hillsides. Intense flavors of blackberries, black cherries, cassis, cola and herbs mark this fine, ageable wine. Don't touch it before 2013, and it should ride out many years beyond that."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A generous expression of mountain Cab, accompanied by 14% Malbec, also estate-grown, this rich, soft wine is remarkable for its texture and mouthfeel, which is velvety and smooth. Peppercorn, dried herb and chocolate pronounce themselves on the palate, provoking thoughts for a similarly accented meal. Enjoy through 2021."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Even Cabernet Sauvignon, that defiantly international variety, takes on a Portuguese character. This has that dark chocolate, high acidity and dry, but juicy character that marks so many Portuguese reds. It also has a more unfortunate volatility that is just too prominent."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Exotic berry and spice aromas are reserved, as the name of the wine implies. On the palate, this is blocky, heavy and jammy. Concentrated flavors of plum and currant are a bit stewed and tomatoey. On the finish, this is dense and tannic, with savory stewy flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft, round and supple on the palate, this is a robust luxurious wine, rich in red and black currant and berry. Pleasing, with a touch of clove, it's a powerful, concentrated statement on the variety."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The bouquet is closed, with only a touch of prune, plum and cranberry aromas emerging. On the palate is raspberry fruit, a hint of veggies and some tight tannins. The finish is lean, and here those tannins assert themselves again in a way that's more than the fruit calls for. Still, it's pretty solid Cab. Best Buy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rooty aromas of prune, berry and rubber band settle on a pleasant, bouncy palate with rubbery tannins. Spice, black pepper, cherry and raspberry flavors end with clove, a touch of sweet oak and juicy acidity. This is uncomplicated but well made."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dark cola, black fruit and marzipan aromas give this a sweet bouquet. The palate is solid, with medium-strength tannins supporting cherry, blackberry and mocha flavors. Oak is no stranger to this wine, so expect ample vanilla and chocolate throughout. A bit herbal, which is common for Chilean Cabernet."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Herbal black-fruit aromas come with a lot of oak. This is full, chunky and meaty in feel, with green hints and blackberry flavors appearing before a blast of hickory smoke takes over. A high-toast, slightly bitter finish confirms the strong oaky character."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Herb, dried leaf, green pepper, tobacco and spice aromas are followed by plump yet elegant cherry and tobacco flavors. Smoke and savory notes linger on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This big-boned Cabernet tastes rich, complex and inviting. It combines cinnamon and cedar aromas, ripe blackberry and cherry flavors and a firm, tannic texture that will love a grilled lamb chop or similar flavorful fare. Concannon ages the reserve lots for at least 18 months in French oak barrels. Best from 2015–2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This medium-weight selection offers concentrated aromas and flavors of black currant and blackberry laced with accents of pepper and earthy spice. There's a bit of bite to the moderate tannins, while hints of tobacco leaf and cocoa nib spice up the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From one of three estate-farmed vineyards belonging to the producer, Bone Ash is dry-farmed and planted to old vines in volcanic soils, the minerality of which is divinely present in this wine. High-toned, balanced in acidity and softly structured, it offers a range of fruit, from sharp cranberry to jammy blackberry, changing in the glass over time. Complex and layered, it will cellar well through 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a spicy, softly lush offering of Cabernet sourced from a tiny part of the Larkmead Vineyard in northern Napa Valley. Black and red currant play off one another well, before revealing subtle layers of dried herb and tobacco leaf, the finish as cushy as the opening and midpalate of the wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Black ash, cedar and crushed raspberries are the aromas here, while an underlying note of wet earth keeps things grounded. The palate has a sweet cherry cordial character while the short finish offers up a hit of mixed berry soup. Drink up."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This 100% Cabernet is a charming wine. It's dry and balanced in tannins and acidity, with tasty cherry jam, red currant, rosehip tea and cedar flavors that are drinking well now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Crushed mineral, herbs and solid berry and plum aromas lead to a tannic, wide, grabby palate with sweet flavors of raspberry jam, prune and brown sugar. Turns heavier and more chunky and baked on the finish. Definitely a ripe Cab."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rich and fruity, this Cabernet Sauvignon is filled with ripe blackberry, black currant and spice flavors. It's a little angular and tannic,  so it might benefit from a few years in a cellar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Collin Cranor remains one of Livermore's most promising young winemakers and this wine proves the point, a blend from three vineyard sites. This has a very pretty raspberry nose and is well-balanced throughout, with blackberry, oak and black tea flavors giving it an intensity of purpose. Will age well over the next couple of years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Very ripe fruit aromas and flavors in this wine resemble dried plums and cherries. The texture feels broad and smooth, with enough firm tannins to give it some grip on the palate. It tastes full bodied and a bit exotic, with some anise and black pepper to enhance the dried-fruit notes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Pristine flavors of cassis and black cherry give an elegant floral quality to this dry, full-bodied Cabernet. Crisp with acidity, it's balanced and impeccably crafted. It finishes long on a delicious coffee-inflected note."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The volatiles are quite amped up on this wine, along with aromas of cola, dried cherries and cranberries. The dark cherry flavors are sweet and rich showing persistence."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The pencil lead, herb and vanilla aromas start out light and elusive. The black-cherry flavors, in contrast, are expressive, showing a good sense of balance and length."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The aromas of dark coffee, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and black cherry are still locked up but provide appeal. The flavors are textured and full, showing layers of dark fruit that undulate into the distance and display a fine sense of balance."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Plum, raspberry and spice aromas stick out on this otherwise dusty smelling Cabernet. This is medium in body, with little in the midsection. Reedy, oaky red-berry flavors come with a cocoa powder note and a spicy finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The aromas are quite smoky, with notes of burnt toast along with herb and vanilla—not a particularly appealing combination. The flavors seem light in concentration. It doesn't all come together."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"If you don't cellar this Cab, you'll miss out on what it has to offer. It is a dry, deeply flavored, superbly structured wine, rich in tannins, with brooding depths of flavors ranging from black currants, cassis and licorice to hints of dried herbs and sweet, toasty cedar wood. The alcohol is on the high side, in the modern Napa style, but the wine wears its heat well. Start drinking it after 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is very rich in blackberries and currants, bearing lots of oak that adds caramelized toastiness. While the tannins are thick and fine, there's something rustic on the finish in the form of extracted, candied sweetness and heat. Flashy as it is, you're best drinking this wine now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Blended with 7% Petit Verdot and 7% Petite Sirah, this velvety and dense wine conveys a pronounced element of charred oak. A reduced note from the barrel permeates at first before allowing aromas and flavors of baked plum to show."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a mix of 56% Sagemoor and 41% Champoux Cabernet, with a 3% splash of estate Petit Verdot. It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor. Woodward Canyon's red wines age beautifully, but if drunk young give them a lot of breathing time."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Still tasting like a very young wine, this opens with pretty fruit flavors that range from raspberry candy to dark layers of black cherry and cassis. The concentration and depth are apparent, though quite compact. The blend includes 14% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A little murky and muddled on the nose, this has an earthy-berry aroma, with a hint of floral-based perfume. It offers acidity and solidity on the palate, which is backed by standard black-fruit flavors, with undertones of vanilla and raw oak. Very good, but it's a bit oaky."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cherry, cassis and a yeasty celebration of grapes mark this wine, which is a majority varietal with small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec, Syrah and Cabernet Franc. Medium bodied, it's softly approachable and priced to serve for a crowd."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this reserve comes from a three-acre block of an estate vineyard. Dark, fleshy plum and soft, supple tannins give it a fruit-tinged structure and lushness, alongside plenty of full-bodied chocolate, tobacco and a hint of mint."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tight black cherry and black-olive aromas meet with mocha and loam on the juicy, approachable nose of this bottling from the northern edge of Paso. The lively blackberry and boysenberry-juice flavors of the palate are framed by a chalky texture and bright acidity, rounded out by crushed gravel and cocoa dust."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine blends 6% co-fermented Syrah from a single lot, the fruit celebrated in all its ripe, full-bodied glory. Cherry, chocolate and barbecue flavors commingle on the soft, round palate that develops further richness in the glass. The tannic profile is strong and thick."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Black pepper, black plum and blueberry show on the nose of this bottling from the nearly 900-acre vineyard atop Cuesta Grade, where it enjoys essentially its own dedicated appellation. A very full mouthfeel delivers blueberry and blackberry-paste flavors along with pencil lead, black coffee and bitter espresso. Still a tad firm in structure, this should age well and open even further in the years to come."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The 2014 vintage was slightly cooler than 2013 in the Barossa, which bodes well for Cabernet. This shows aromatic red currants, bay leaf and sage on the nose, then folds in hints of cinnamon and brown sugar. The oak is in the background, letting the fruit carry the wine, yet building in a rich, velvety texture. Drink now–2030."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Pleasant red-fruit aromas kick it off, followed by regular-weight cherry and cassis flavors that come with a hint of herbal essence. The finish is racy and almost rough, but there's enough body and weight to the wine to push it across the finish line."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A very rich, dry Cabernet, marked by dusty tannins, and with flavors of blackberries, dark chocolate, sweet herbs and green olives. Very fine in the mouth, clearly a wine with pedigree, but it needs time. Hold until 2014."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This blend of Sagemoor, Weinbau and Heather Hill vineyards displays barrel aromas of cocoa and woodspice followed by dark cherries. It's medium bodied with abundant dark cherry and barrel flavors backed by gruff tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Made from mountain grapes, this is an extraordinarily rich, concentrated young Cabernet Sauvignon. It's marked by classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and cassis liqueur. A minor quibble is that it's too soft and melted for further development, but it scores high on the deliciousness scale."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Smoky tar is met by dark brick color in this serious, robust and 100% varietal wine. Jammy black cherry is complemented by chewy tannin. This is a steak wine in every way, rich and rewarding."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft and one-dimensional but interesting, this Cabernet has upfront flavors of blackberry jam, black currants, anise and oak. It's dry and tannic, but doesn't have the stuffing to age. Drink now–2016."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a 100% varietal wine, with fruit sourced from Sonoma Mountain as well as Dry Creek and Alexander valleys. Black fruit wraps around generous tannin and oak as a touch of cola spice attempts to liven things up on the palate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine's aromas suggest bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, cherry and spice. The palate is rich and layered, with sumptuous red and black fruit flavors speckled with plentiful barrel accents."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tart cherry, softened oak and firm tannin mark this 100% varietal wine most. It's fairly concentrated despite a leanness on the palate and finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"From the producer's dry-farmed estate vineyard, and supported by small amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this wine is elegant in sage and black cherry, silky on the palate in satisfying ways. Savory tea and an element of chocolate truffle give it additional complexity around a core of silky tannin."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"While soft and approachable, this wine also offers a density of black currant and cherry that gives significant power and juicy exuberance. Sizable tannins risk overtaking the fruit, but never do, with the oak imparting a jolt of smokiness on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Fascinating earthy, spicy aromas and flavors give an extra dimension to this full-bodied and richly textured wine. New leather, cardamom, and cumin scents infuse the aroma, while ripe but not sweet black currant, dark cherry and clove flavors flood the palate. It's rich enough to enjoy now but will be best after 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"At this price, and with wide availability, this is a great Cabernet for everyday consumption. It's dry, tannic and rich in black currants and oak, with a brisk edge of acidity to cut through oily beef and cheeses. Production was 43,200 cases."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Stuhlmuller's regular 2008 Cabernet, released a year ago, was quite good. This one's even better. It has all the hallmarks of a superior Cabernet, with rich, delicious blackberry, cherry, licorice, Dr. Pepper cola and oak flavors, framed into soft, intricate tannins. With a pleasant minerality, it should age well through 2016, gradually losing fruit."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Perfumed in cassis and chocolate, this wine starts out with soft layers of fruit, but lacks structure and definition, making for a simple, lighthearted quaff."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine shows off Yountville fruit at its finest, starting with a floral component to the nose. Spicy, bright and lifted, it coats the palate in ripe berry and cherry, ending with a snap of vanilla."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a good but decidedly herbal-leaning Cab. The nose gives off tomato, spice and light berry aromas. It's fresh and medium in heft, with more herb and spice flavors than black fruit. Things turn woody, spicy, dry and slightly hot on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is an excellent young Cabernet Sauvignon that will take some bottle age. Coming on the heels of the high-scoring 2004, it's full-bodied and extraordinarily rich, with intense blackberry, black currant, chocolate, coffee and cedar flavors, wrapped into near-perfect tannins. Shows great grapes and a deft winemaking hand."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a Bordeaux-style blend, principally Cabernet Sauvignon, with small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. It's stylish and firm, based upon a solid cassis note. The extended barrel aging—32 months in French oak—brings on seductive flavors of brown sugar, molasses and maple syrup, with touches of espresso and dark chocolate. The structure remains tight and polished, with excellent balance."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The aromas of powerful cedar, cherry, currant and oak suggest great concentration and focus. It’s actually a bit light on the fruit and soft in tannins, although the oak is plush and toasty. There’s certainly elegance and flavor, but it’s a wine to drink now, not age."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Cab is dry and properly tannic, with good blackberry, mocha and herb flavors. On the downside is a strange ashiness, like the grapes were hit by smoke from a wildfire. Drink up."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"So much oak on this wine, it's like being inside a barrel. Vanilla, buttered toast, caramel and char flavors star, with a bit of blackberry fruit struggling to express itself."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A very good, richly tannic wine that flatters with strong flavors of blackberries, cherries and oak. It may be a little too ripe for its own good, though, as it's pretty jammy. For some reason, the winery lowered the price considerably from the 2005, which was a much better wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A polished, complex wine to drink now, despite considerable tannins. Give it a decant for a few hours to let it mellow. Shows ripe blackberry, cherry, licorice, cola and smoky oak flavors that are young, intense and nervy in acids."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Gritty, tarry aromas of black olive and raspberry lead to a hard palate with choppy acidity. Sizzling plum and currant flavors come with a burnt note, while a long finish is bolstered by preserving acidity. This is a patented Chilean Cab: expect a heavy herbal character centered around olive and eucalyptus."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Simple and slightly earthy, Covey's budget Cab is not as appealing as their Merlot, but it's a good effort nonetheless. Black cherry and cassis speak to the variety, and the stiff tannins suggest some staying power. —P.G."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Basically characterized by gigantic fruit that leaves little to the imagination. Blackberries, cherries, cola and spicy plums explode in the mouth, and while the wine is technically dry, it's sweet in fruity essence. Oak adds caramel and vanilla."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This top-end Cabernet from the dynamic Moletto estate delivers impressive intensity and extremely attractive notes of black fruit, toasted spice and black stone. The nose is slightly sweet smelling and the mouthfeel is modern, penetrating, plush and velvety."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A dreary, simple wine, as thin as water with a few drops of blackberry syrup. It's also soft and bitter on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Small percentages of Merlot and Petit Verdot soften this robustly ripe red, hugely extracted in black currant and blackberry. Mocha, cigar smoke and leather saddle contribute a more muscular imprint, as a rounded weightiness holds on tenaciously to the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Exotic hints of dill and clove open on the nose in this elegantly robust wine, which finds a balance in its brightness of red cherry and red currant. Generous tannin takes on a leathery feel on the palate, finding a softness that lingers on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's a richness to this wine that's paired with a soft warmth throughout, as forward notes of kirsch, muddled ripe strawberries, braised rhubarb and red-plum flesh flood the nose and mouth. Drinkable now, but with a gripping finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The winery's blend of all six of its single-vineyard designates, this contains smaller amounts of Malbec, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Cab Franc in support of the Cab Sauvignon. Dried herbal components pique the aroma, followed by spicy cinnamon and black pepper seasonings on the palate. Black licorice marks the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Slightly heavy and saucy, with a bit of cooked fruit and lemony oak to the nose. But it's not over-the-top baked or overoaked, so there's still some black-fruit quality to mine as well as decent chocolate and mocha on the finish. Hardly elegant, but by the same token it's not wanting for gusto."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This sumptuous Cabernet speaks volumes to the power of good winemaking in a challenging vintage. The wine is juicy, rich and layered in crisp red fruit and dusty spice. It's built to age through 2020, but you could decant it now and enjoy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The winery headed north for these grapes to produce this light rosé in the classic shade of pink. Strawberry and bubblegum aromas are cut by a splash of lime juice. A stony texture frames the palate, offering light raspberry, red cherry and tangerine-peel flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"To call this anything other than modern in style would be incorrect. It's soft and silky and direct in blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate and caramel flavors, although the finish is technically dry. Delicious and fancy, and will appeal to fans of ripe, sweet fruit, but it doesn't have the structure for aging."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Moldovan Cabernet Sauvignon has aromas of cherry vanilla, plum and cassis. In the mouth it has soft flavors of black currants, prunes and fresh black plums before the persistent finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Big mountain fruit here throws powerful aromas of ripe plum, thyme and bacon, while full-scale oaking yields maple aromas, vanilla flavors, and coffee on the finish. The wood element is a little weighty at this point, but there's solid fruit to support it."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The inaugural release of this wine, this hails largely from the esteemed Klipsun Vineyard. Alluring aromas of herb, earth, cherry liqueur and black fruit lead to sweet, sappy black-fruit flavors and burly but still well-integrated tannins. It's only going to get better with additional time in the bottle. Best after 2023."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dense and rich, this is a hearty dry red for near-term drinking. Black olive and espresso aromas give way to chocolate and dark berries on the palate, while the finish is velvety and warm."
Cabernet Sauvignon,This is an informal and fresh Cabernet that would pair perfectly with easy pasta dishes or lasagna. Aromas include black cherry and plum and the wine offers a polished and compact feel overall.
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aromas of blackberry, ripe cherry, black pepper and espresso bean delight the nose. Deep ruby red, this wine has flavors of black cherry, blackberry, cinnamon and nutmeg that are supported by a soft grid of velvety tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Red cherry and raspberry flavors in this Cabernet Sauvignon show remarkably fresh and pure. It's a juicy, approachably fruity wine but also structured keenly by zesty acidity and fine, firm tannins. Surprisingly well balanced for a big, ripe red."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a simple blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec mostly, that's lively and slightly spritzy. Strawberry, cranberry and cassis appear, as walls of dry tannins spark on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tight and quite dry, this mixes dried herbs with wild blackberry and boysenberry fruit flavors. The ample acidity underscores just-ripe-enough tannins; but overall what most impresses is the wine's balance, tension and length."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Very ripe, dense and concentrated. Although it's totally dry, the wine shows massive, sweet flavors of blackberry and cherry fruit. Impresses for sheer power, as well as the length of finish. Cellar this youthful beauty for 6–7 years and see what it does."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Woody tannins support this full-bodied reserve wine's dark, brooding black fruit. Grippy on the palate, it combines forceful mocha, leather and cedar flavors with touches of sage and graphite."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A good, richly flavored Cabernet that shows proper varietal character without any special qualities. Flavors of blackcurrants drink dry, wrapped in smooth tannins. May improve a bit with a few years in the cellar."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dark berry, herb and fig aromas lead to dense, full and palate-coating dark fruit flavors. It checks all the boxes for varietal correctness, concentration and value."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dry as dust and very tannic, this Cabernet simply isn't ready for prime time yet. It's tightly wound and tough, and resists breaking down. But there are plenty of blackberries tucked deep inside. Hold this elegant wine until after 2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This luxury-level project by Jeff Tanner and Rob DaFoe delivers aromas of rich blackberry jam nuanced with wet tobacco, loam, tomato leaf and a touch of spearmint. Blackberries and blueberries also line the edges of the palate, but the core is all about spicy tobacco and black pepper. There's lot of acidity four years in, so this will stand the test of time in the cellar. Drink 2017 through 2028."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's a sweet, mocha oak streak at the center of this wine, with fruity notes of fleshy black plum and cherry as well as a hint of raspberry sauce. The palate is round and full, followed by astringent tannins that linger on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cabernet from Discovery (43%) and Champoux (43%) vineyards make up the heart of this wine, with dollops of Klipsun Merlot and Champoux Cabernet Franc. Pungent aromas of blackberry, herb and earth lead to sweet black cherry and blackberry flavors that show sophistication. The sense of balance is compelling. It's very pretty, a thinking person's Cabernet."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"At the age of 5 1/2 years, this Cabernet is still very forward and sweet in blackberry, cherry, anise and cedar flavors. The tannins are rich and thick, in the way of mountain grapes. The wine tastes a bit one-dimensional, although it could be going through an awkward phase."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Shows the soft acids, gentle tannins and herbaceousness that mark most Alexander Valley Cabs, with supporting cherry, red currant and licorice flavors. It's a complex wine, balanced and intriguing, and a fine pairing for a very wide variety of foods. Interestingly, indigenous, or wild, yeast was used for fermentation."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Feudo Arancio consistently delivers Best Buy value wines and this dense Cabernet Sauvignon is no exception. Aromas include big berry fruit, cherry, spice, mineral and dried herbs. It has good complexity overall with a gritty, raw texture."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There's a reductive funk at first on the nose, with singed rubber and creosote, but that quickly gives way to cherry, boysenberry and brown spices. Flavors are dominated by tart cherry and cedar, with hints of slate-driven, earthy minerals."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A 100% varietal wine, this is a tense study in black cherry, blueberry, and dry chalky tannins, which need further time to resolve. Still puckering on the finish, it offers streaks of cedar, pencil lead and coconut that are still integrating. Drink now through 2023."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Inky violet-red in color, this wine has aromas of raspberry, black cherry, vanilla and mixed baking spices. Flavors of black cherry, raspberry, coffee and toffee are equally bright on entry and at the finish, with a nice mellow period in the middle. The silky finish is marked by a vivid salted toffee splash."
Cabernet Sauvignon,This is a simple North Coast Cabernet with herbal and green olive and pepper tones.
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is Baldacci's regular Cab, although most wineries would be content for it to be their reserve. It's a powerful, rich young wine, massive in blackberry, currant and oak flavors, with a succulent edge of milk chocolate. The tannins are pure Stags Leap, giving a complex contrapuntal balance of grip and structure to the opulent fruit. Just fabulous in every aspect, a wine to dazzle. Drink now through 2010, at least."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dense with flavors of blueberry and cassis, it's been soaked in delicious French oak barrels (60% new) for 30 months, and then given further bottle age before being released. Coconut and vanilla highlights are threaded through long, fine, dense, ripe tannins. This strong, stylish wine can be cellared until 2024–2029."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"An impressive Cabernet, the winery's best effort in years. Dry and firm in tannins, it shows a Bordeaux-esque elegance and balance, with sage and cedar notes framing underlying red currant fruit. Now through 2012."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Smoky oak surrounds robust black fruit, peppercorn and a soft, supple core of easygoing texture and rounded richness. The fruit is sourced primary from the relatively cool Oak Knoll District."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"There is impressive depth to the nose of this bottling, with concentrated black cherry, black plum and blueberry fruit enhanced by white pepper, roasted meat, licorice and hot asphalt. The palate is awash in savory flavors, with soy, charred beef and tobacco followed by waves of blueberry and leather and a wash of vanilla, plum skin and mocha, all atop perfectly polished tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Richly concentrated and tannic, this wine shows loads of smoke on the nose and palate, but a touch of reduction obfuscates its black cherry and dried herb notes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is an easy-gulping, light wine with fruity aromas, nice cherry and raspberry flavors, medium body and a soft mouthfeel."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"It's easy to see why Silver Oak remains so popular with the restaurant crowd. It's made in a more restrained style than many other Napa Cabs. There's plenty of berry and currant fruit as well as oak, but it's accompanied by tobacco and herbs that give the wine an earthiness. What the wine lacks in dazzle it more than makes up for in elegance and subtlety. Should develop well for at least a decade."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Accents of vanilla, fresh mint and graham cracker crumbs add a touch of complexity to the ripe black plum and cherry flavors on Comtesse Thérèse's Aquebogue Estate. Elegantly structured with a brisk, lean acidity and soft, powdery tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This 100% Cabernet is the winery's best amongst their new releases. It's rich and ripe with blackberries and cherries, along with lots of new French oak. It's also very tannic, but the wine isn't likely to improve in the long haul, so enjoy it now and over the next few years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Scratchy aromas of red fruits come with a chemical note of paint that feels hard and forced. Vanilla-like oak collides with green notes and bitterness that lead to a buttery finish.
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The finest Jester Cabernet I can remember, this full-bodied yet supple wine features aromas of cassis, cedar and vanilla in fine balance. Cassis and chocolate flavors continue in the same vein, followed by a silky, long finish. Drink now–2028."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"So softly delicious, it's probably not an ager, but what a terrific wine to drink now and over the next few years. Really luscious, showing modern-style ripe blackberry, black cherry, cassis and mocha flavors that sink deep and last long into the finish. The tannins and overall structure lift it into classy elegance."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The vineyard is in the heart of the Rutherford bench. The wine is rich in fruit and tannins, but a bit clumsy, with a chunky, tannic mouthfeel and jammy, direct blackberry and blueberry fruit flavors. Not ready for drinking now, but well-made, and should age well, as Cabs from this stretch tend to have a long life."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cooked blackberries, baked black plum, grape candy and lilac touches show on the nose of this bottling, which is easy to like and uncomplicated. Violet floral flavors kick off the palate, followed by coffee spice, cedar and dark berry fruit, all framed by moderate tannic tension."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dark chocolate speaks loudest in this wine, blended with 9% Petit Verdot, the grapes sourced from three vineyards across the valley, from Calistoga to Coombsville. Smoky and soft, it offers decadence within a lengthy structure, highlighted in ruby raspberry and blackberry."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The color is about as deep as wine gets, virtually black except for a thin red-purple rim. The aromas resemble black cherries, even black olives and the flavors are as rich as blackberry jam, but without the sweetness. So this is a bold, full-bodied wine with lots of well-integrated tannins that make it astringent to drink at this young age. It will be best after 2020, when it will have softened and gained more diverse flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dense, with plum-prune, coffee and chocolate aromas, this wine offers very ripe dark-fruit flavors accented by tobacco and cedar shadings. The mouthfeel is big, but very easy, even soft; with a little more spine-acidity and tannins-this wine could merit a higher score. Still, it's a very pleasing and promising first offering."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Thick and powerful, this pure Cabernet boasts a wide offering of aromas: Plum, prune, wild mushroom, moist earth and mature fruit are identifiable characteristics. The mouthfeel is gritty and raw but full of penetrating flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The wine, unusually 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, is ripe and juicy with some smoky tannins in support. It has a finely perfumed character although touches of extraction give it a bitter edge. That should blow by, leaving an attractive fruity wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Soft and supple on the palate, this impressive wine is lightly spiced with dust and clove, its tannins rounded and in support of lingering cassis and red cherry flavors. Mocha and tobacco lend additional depth and complexity as it unfolds, punctuated by juicy acidity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"The aromas are not that inviting: roasted tomato, bramble, burnt earth, etc. The mouth is textured and solid, with savory, herbal berry flavors. Grabby and full on the finish, with a reduced, weighty overall persona. Strained but still pretty good for the money."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This tight and compact Cabernet has an earthy base, with leafy forest-floor flavors and very astringent tannins. That said, there is good fruit at the core, especially the note of spicy plum."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Very ripe, soft and sugary sweet, this Cab has flavors of blackberries, cherries, mocha and caramelized oak. It doesn't really taste like the kind of tannic, ageworthy wine you expect from Diamond Mountain. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"It's easy to use the word “huge” to describe this Cabernet, which contains smaller amounts of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. It immediately takes over the palate with ripe, opulent cherry pie, blackberry tart, cassis liqueur, green olive and oak flavors. The tannins are very strong, the most powerful of Mondavi Cabernets in years. Which leads to the question of ageability. Where's this wine going? On the negative side is high alcohol, which gives it a burn. So drink it over the next 5–6 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dry, smooth and distinguished. Shows Mondavi's ability to get the grapes ripe in blackberries and currants, yet the fruit pulls back at the last moment, letting earthy, herbal notes take over, providing complexity and endless pleasure. The tannins are pure Oakville—sweet, soft and supple. Drink this elegant, balanced wine over the next six years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Easy-drinking, this is an example of a lighter, but still very satisfying style of Cabernet. The bouquet is tart berries, cedar, tobacco and rhubarb. Smooth and evenly textured, the palate displays cola and sweet tobacco flavors. Tangy tannins and dried fruit and spice flavors on the finish close this forward charmer from Mendocino."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a tasty, juicy, easy-drinking wine with good fruit flavors. Well balanced and medium bodied, it offers some of the density and texture expected, but without going over the top in tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Thick and rich, this has saddle and tobacco going on, alongside leather and smoke. A meaty, gamy note akin to bacon also characterizes the wine, as well as jammy blackberry and clove."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is singer/songwriter John Legend's inaugural wine project in conjunction with Raymond Vineyards in the Napa Valley. Combining 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Petit Verdot, it tells a powerful story in thick layers of blackberry cobbler, chocolate and coffee, the tannin and oak integrated and silky smooth. This is a wine of great presence."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is classic Cabernet, from the reticent aromas of pencil shavings to the restrained flavors of cassis and cigar box. It's on the full-bodied side of the spectrum, with enough dusty tannins to suggest longevity through at least 2020, despite an already velvety finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Full bodied and with good, gripping tannins to make the texture appetizing, this wine is very dry and nicely complex. Moderate cranberry and dark chocolate flavors are accented by hints of sage and black olive—classic Cabernet traits."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a new brand from the Scotto family. A celebration of the family's 50-year history of winemaking in California, it's blended with a splash of Petit Verdot, with an accessible and friendly feel. It's still pretty tannic, offering anise and herbal overtones beneath cracked pink peppercorn and currant notes, but airing in the glass will soften the cassis and oak flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine takes a new-world view of Cabernet Sauvignon—juicy, fruity and with a mouthful of black fruit and chocolate-flavored tannins. At the same time, there's a Portuguese twist in the spice, and the is structured with bold acidity and a firm, dry core. Drink from 2014."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Right off the bat this wine is pure and smooth. The nose is pretty, with cranberry and cassis. Next up is a palate of pure red fruit and only a light shading of oak. The finish draws applause for its clarity and buttery nuances. It's what a good Chilean Cabernet should be; it's ripe and easy to drink, yet fairly solid and impressive. Best Buy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A well-made relatively large production Cabernet, fruity in black cherry with a smoky edge of cinnamon toast and soft vanilla. Pour at your next party."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a rich and concentrated wine with welcoming aromas of black fruits, bacon, African violets and soft black pepper. The mouth is as intense as one would anticipate with more concentrated dark plum and currant flavors and accents of coconut on the long finish. The tannins are gripping and the structure firm; try with hearty red meat dishes for a superb pairing."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cassis, olive and a hint of nail polish make for a solid, Chilean-style nose. The palate has a firm, juicy feel and nice flavors of raspberry and plum followed by secondary notes of woodspice and vanilla. Peppery and a little resiny on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Made from 100% Cabernet, this is a great house wine for the price. It's dry, full-bodied and tannic, with proper black currant, blackberry, mocha and oak flavors. Easy to find, with 20,000 cases produced."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This well-made wine, blended with small percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Merlot, is an astounding value. Currant and cranberry notes and an underbelly of tannins play together in a smooth texture of rich concentration."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine shows a classic Yakima Valley profile, with aromas and flavors of orange peel, fresh green herbs and cherry, along with barrel spice accents. It's made in a restrained style, with tart flavors carrying on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Here's a ripe, exuberantly fruity Cabernet that tastes like a pastry dessert melted into wine. But it's dry. Delicious for its buttery, baked pie crust flavors of black cherries and cola. Seems best now and for a few years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This 100% Cabernet is tannic, acidic and dry, yet remarkably fruity as well. It shows a classic cool-climate Napa structure, with blackberry, currant and oak flavors. It's not yet ready to drink, so give it at least six years in the cellar, and possibly far longer."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Elegant aromas of red currant, cherry and pepper start this solid Cab from Idaho. On the palate, oak and fruit integration gives the wine a smooth, rich style. Unfolding and full of personality. Pair with steaks, burgers."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"Kind of big for a value wine, with aromas of plum and berry along with shoe polish and chocolate. The palate has some richness but not too much depth or weight, while the flavors of blackberry and baked plum are convincing. Finishes soft and short, with cola and candied notes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A top-of-the-line effort and a departure from the producer's single-vineyard, 100% varietal bottlings, this blends 4% Malbec and 3% Merlot. Spicy with clove scents, it showcases deep cassis and cranberry flavors, with a lift of red fruit and supportive acidity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine strikes a superb balance between herbaceous, green notes and ripe black fruit, all graced with a kiss of sweet vanilla. Rich blackberry and cassis flavors flood the palate, but then transition to sweet smoke and oak flavors on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"This mountain-grown wine is hugely tannic and oaky, hard to penetrate in its full-bodied ripeness. Smoky oak and currant flavors vie for attention against a backdrop of concentration and power."
Cabernet Sauvignon,"A little forced and pickled on the nose, but overall this is pretty much your standard value-priced Chilean Cab, meaning it offers herbal notes and olive along with medium-level currant and plum flavors. Very basic and by no means a bad wine."
Chardonnay,"From four estate vineyards, this wine appears to be low in oak and extra crisp in mouthfeel, offering austere apple and citrus elements with a slight metallic edge."
Chardonnay,"Light and clean aromas of Asian pear, pear blossoms, apple flesh and white flowers show on the nose of this bottling from a property on the far western edge of the maritime appellation. Bright acidity presents flavors of lime, green apples, Anjou pear flesh and a touch of kiwi, with savory sea-salt touches."
Chardonnay,"A whiff of hay and bramble lends an earthy tone to this otherwise bright, easy-drinking wine. On the palate, fresh tangerine, white peach and lemon flavors are refreshing and pristine. Medium bodied and a bit racy, the finish is quite brisk."
Chardonnay,"With aromas like butter and custard, and flavors that suggest ripe apple and crisp lemon, this is both refreshing and multifaceted. It feels light bodied and has a bit of a sweet-tart balance going for it."
Chardonnay,"Light hay in color and with a creamy, near-perfect foam, this sparkler shows fresh Asian pear, light plumeria, wet river stone and rain-on-sidewalk aromas, altogether quite minerally on the nose. Impressively textural, it's cleansing on the palate, a bit like licking chalk, with flavors of lemon skin, tart yellow-apple rind and crisp pear flesh."
Chardonnay,"This wine carries a new label, very spare; the drawing of house and vineyard is gone; it's all white with simple type. The wine is simple, soapy, light and showing just a watery impression of citrus, banana and tropical fruits."
Chardonnay,"Well integrated in terms of barrel use (listed as 60% used French oak and 40% new), this features a robust exuberance of fruit, from Asian pear to Meyer lemon. Spicy with a touch of nutmeg and ginger, it hones a fine line of minerality throughout."
Chardonnay,"This is a Chardonnay-based wine with aromas of white mineral, stone fruit and passion fruit. It is an easy, no-fuss wine that would pair well with light salad lunches or sandwich snacks."
Chardonnay,"Made from fruit that's sourced from the northern Côte Chalonnaise, this structured wine shows crisp acids and bright yellow fruits, with a sense of richness that comes from the vanilla and apricot flavors. The finish is laced with refreshing acidity."
Chardonnay,"This is dry and crisp in acidity, with suggestions of oranges and buttered toast that wash out in the finish."
Chardonnay,"Nectarine flesh and a hint of guava combine for a rather tropical-leaning nose on this wine from the famed Hollywood director's collection. A straightforward and very ripe Gala apple character characterizes the palate, boosted by honeysuckle and tangerine, laid across a decently grippy texture."
Chardonnay,"From this rich vintage comes this delicious, open wine. Flavors of tropical fruit and peach create an opulent and generous feel, with notes from having aged in wood offering complexity. It's concentrated and ageworthy, worth keeping for 4–5 years and more."
Chardonnay,"With mild white-fruit aromas, dusty notes and a hint of banana, this is appealing up front. In the mouth, it's solid and pure feeling, with freshness and punchy acidity propelling tropical fruit flavors and oak-based vanilla. Oak spice, length and a full body make the finish impressive. 600 cases made."
Chardonnay,"Great acidity and minerality in this elegant young wine. Doesn't show the rich concentration of De Loach's single-vineyard Chards, but then again, it costs far less. It's actually a good value for a dry, minerally and complex Russian River Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold."
Chardonnay,"This has a plump, yeasty, leesy feel, with tropical fruit and lychee aromas. Flavors of bread and white fruit unfold on the palate, with notes of banana and papaya on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Sliced green pears, honeysuckle, jasmine, cut limes and a touch of apple-flavored bubblegum show on the nose of this bottling. The texture is nicely cut with steely grip, releasing flavors of sour apple, ripe nectarine and honeydew."
Chardonnay,"A touch of spice and vanilla from wood aging is balanced by ripe yellow fruits and honey. This wine is freshened by lime-juice acidity that gives a crisp texture. Behind all this fruit is a dense structure, weight and concentration. It's a generous wine that will age further; drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,"Pressed apple and pear notes are accented with penetrating layers of smoke, nuts and clove on this full-bodied Chardonnay. Tart lemon acidity lends freshness to the midpalate and into a spry finish."
Chardonnay,"Stony, minerally aromas show a pinch of toast on top of white peach and apple cider scents. On the palate, this stays on the straight and narrow, with high acidity. Clementine and tangerine flavors finish as stony as the name implies; drink this shellfish-friendly, unique Argentinean Chardonnay through 2022."
Chardonnay,"This soft, ripe wine has good apricot and peach flavors alongside the crisper citrus acidity. It is spicy, fruity and ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"This young, stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay has a beery hoppiness to the aromas, leading into a tart, juicy and crisp palate of lime and grapefruit. The acids taste of wet stone, and that vivid minerality brings dimension and lift to the finish."
Chardonnay,"Buttery aromas and buttery, spicy flavors lend an outgoing personality to this medium-bodied wine. Vanilla and cream flavors add some interest, while the texture is broad and smooth."
Chardonnay,"Sweet in jammy apricots and oranges, it has a creamy mouthfeel and a good burst of acidity for balance."
Chardonnay,"Heavy pear and apple aromas pound the olfactory senses, prior to citrus and Bosc pear flavors. In its favor, the acids are bright, which keeps the wine's weight and feel in balance. There's also an appealing flinty nuance, which will make it go well with shellfish and salads."
Chardonnay,"This young wine is still pulling itself together. A small percentage was barrel-fermented, but what dominates are crisp fruit flavors of lime and apple. There's a whiff of flint and cinnamon also, with caramel creaminess rounding out the finish. All good components that need more time to knit together."
Chardonnay,"Toast aromas accent ripe pears and golden-delicious apples in this soft, easy-to-like Chard that only lacks a bit of depth. A slightly bitter note on the finish should become less noticeable over the next few months."
Chardonnay,"Notes of buttered toast, butterscotch candy and caramel popcorn flavors dominate this wine. Underneath all that is a wine with pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, brightened with crisp acidity."
Chardonnay,"Soft, with wood and honey flavors, white flower aromas and light acidity. The wine feels warm, rich and balanced."
Chardonnay,"This Chardonnay is striking in its ability to convey marshmallow roasting over a campfire. It's full-bodied and lush, its rich fruit core of apple and pear seemingly dressed in clarified butter. That richness, however, doesn't weigh down the palate; it finishes with refinement."
Chardonnay,"Intriguing notes of honey, poached pear, apple with drizzled caramel and a light touch of marzipan show on the nose on this bottling that leans somewhat sweet in aromas. But the sip is dry, with Asian pear, jasmine and honeysuckle elements, quite crisp and engaging for the palate on multiple levels."
Chardonnay,"This wine is soft, creamy and light. Attractive acidity along with a fresh apple character gives a fresh aftertaste. Drink now. This is one of the first vintages since Labouré-Roi, which was hit by scandal in 2012, passed into new ownership."
Chardonnay,"Spicy, toasty wine that balances the wood with rich fruit. Rounded, smooth texture, lifted by wood spice and apricot juice."
Chardonnay,"Tastes a bit sharp and minty in the mouth, but you'll find some good new oaky vanilla and smoke flavors backing up pineapples, green apples and pears."
Chardonnay,"This toasty bottling shows some evident maturity in terms of fruit richness. It offers toasted walnut, espresso, vanilla and yellow apple-skin flavors alongside large, brisk bubbles and crisp acidity."
Chardonnay,"The sunny personality shows ripe pear, vanilla and melted butter flavors, medium body, a nicely smooth texture and some fresh acidity. The typical California fruitiness seems well complemented by oak."
Chardonnay,"This value-minded selection blends plenty of bright citrus and apple flavors with good acidity and a hint of sweetness for a complete and pleasing package. It is medium bodied, light on its feet and refreshing. Enjoy now."
Chardonnay,"This esteemed winery's younger Chardonnays are all about tension and the future. This begins with slightly sour aromas of yogurt and goat cheese along with shave fennel, radish, daikon and lemongrass. The palate is power by citrusy pith, brine and nectarine peels, with just the tiniest touch of green apple ripeness. Drink 2018–2024."
Chardonnay,"Brilliantly ripe pineapple, tangerine and lemon fruit flavors mark this savory young Chardonnay. It shows the citrusy acidity of the cool-climate Edna Valley, with a long, spicy finish. Clean and mouthwatering, it offers a lot for the price."
Chardonnay,"This wine displays all of the intensity of expression of Cold Creek. Aromas of toasty spices and pear are light but lead to a full, rich-feeling palate, with the acids providing a perfect counterbalance."
Chardonnay,"There is a touch of wood here, partnering with the wine's weight, minerality and crisp character. White fruit flavors of apple and pear lend further brightness."
Chardonnay,"This is a big, bold wine with scents of ripe pear and a hint of anise. The fruit seems to grow and add dimension in the mouth, featuring pears and peaches that are topped off with a dollop of spicy oak and butter."
Chardonnay,"Given this Chandon-owned winery's success with Malbec, you might hope for more here. But this fading Chardonnay doesn't have much going for it. It's flat, with pleasant clove-like aromas and cider-like flavors. It also finishes flat, indicating a short lifespan ahead of it."
Chardonnay,"En Paradis—“in paradise”—refers to a vineyard owned by Régine and Jean Rijckaert. The wine is deliciously and very lightly oxidized, showing a great line of tangy, juicy green and white fruits which are overlaid by pineapple acidity. It has fine concentration and a so-refreshing lemon-zest aftertaste."
Chardonnay,"From a vineyard known for producing powerfully ripe, dense fruit with wet-stone minerality, this wine delivers on many of those points. It offers intense, rich tastes of baked apple, graham-cracker crust and crème brûlée. Soft and layered, it ends in a statement of big fruit."
Chardonnay,"This fascinating Chardonnay combines elegance with the opulence you expect from California. It's ripe and forward in papaya, quince, mango, pear and pineapple fruits, but also shows a steely minerality that's as fresh and pure as snowmelt water in a pebbly stream. It is never forward or over-the-top."
Chardonnay,"There's a salty, gravelly stone character to this medium-bodied wine that largely defines it, marking the grapes original home in the vineyard's Sand Hill block, planted entirely to one Dijon clone. Caramel apple meets a complement of crisper green apple, finding balance and grace in the glass."
Chardonnay,"Honeyed in apple, pear and mango, this is a tightly wound, full-bodied wine, voluptuous and quite ripe in style."
Chardonnay,"A strong, toasted, smoky aroma and charred oak flavors define this medium-bodied, rich-textured wine. Not exactly light on its feet, but fans of oak will appreciate the bold, toasty, buttery character."
Chardonnay,"While the nose on this Chardonnay is decidedly savory, with notes of cooked apples and buttery cheese rinds, the palate is surprisingly feminine, with pretty orange-blossom and apple jelly notes. Opulent and fruity, yet refreshingly-balanced in alcohol and acidity."
Chardonnay,"A big improvement over the '08 bottling, the winery's '09 is dry and tart in Central Coast acidity, with pure, clean flavors of tangerine, vanilla and buttered toast. It's a lovely Chardonnay; drink now."
Chardonnay,"Pretty thin going, almost like a Sauvignon Blanc with its tart, citrusy fruit flavors and high acidity. Not a bad wine, but if you're looking for a rich, oaky Chardonnay, shop around."
Chardonnay,"A nose of lemon and petrol opens into flavors of lemon, pears, petrol and white flowers, with slightly overpowering toast notes. Tannins are a bit stiff for an otherwise bright white that has a slightly tart finish."
Chardonnay,"Crisply fresh, this full-bodied wine has citrus fruitiness that is followed by hints of toast and honey that are just developing. Well balanced, it's very textured while also fruity, and will develop well in bottle. Drink from 2017 for the more mature flavors to bring their own character to the wine."
Chardonnay,"Close to the slope of Grand Crus, Fourchaume is one of the best known of the premiers in Chablis. This ripe wine with its touches of vanilla as well as yellow fruits and acidity has a lightly honeyed character typical of the vintage. It is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017."
Chardonnay,"Stone, lime salt and lemon zest pique the entry of this medium-bodied white, which is well-integrated in terms of oak. High in citrus flavor and pear, it has a gritty texture that gives it added complexity."
Chardonnay,"Tart Mandarin orange rind is woven into riper aromas of Anjou pear and honey butter on the nose of this wine. Its palate is Chablis-like, with lime, lemon and kumquat flavors, strung from a nervy, chalky spine, finishing with limestone and gravel touches."
Chardonnay,"Floral and dusty on the nose, this Chardonnay is racy, fruity and fairly full in body. Melon and citrus flavors are big but clean, and not much differs on the finish. Overall, this is juicy, bright and full of fruit."
Chardonnay,"Made in the modern California style, with very ripe, rather sweet pineapple jam, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture."
Chardonnay,"Caramelized apples and toasted squash-seed aromas arise from this wine, which offers good zing but a more oxidized style on the palate. Flavors of nut-based syrups, dried citrus and slightly sour orange juice arise once sipped."
Chardonnay,"A rounded, toast-rich wine, with the full creaminess of malolactic acidity very evident. This richness works, giving a sensuous, opulent style, just kept in check by the acidity, but very ready to let all its ripeness rip."
Chardonnay,"Let me confess upfront: creamed corn was one of my favorite side dishes when I was a child. That said, it's not something I like in my wine, and this medium-bodied Chardonnay shows an excess of those sweet corn and lactic aromas and flavors."
Chardonnay,"With fine concentration and crisp fruit, this is a young wine with a future. Ripe apples and lemon zest are balanced with a strongly mineral texture as well as spice. The wine is rich, and will develop over the next two years. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,"Aromas of citrus rind, baking spice and baked bread fill the aromas. The palate is tart with lively fruit flavors."
Chardonnay,"Crisp, tight and mineral, this classic wine has citrus and apple fruits filled out with creamed pear. The zingy texture is still young and vibrant. With intense acidity at the end, the wine could still develop, so drink from early 2017."
Chardonnay,"This elegant wine, one of very few brands from Humboldt County, strikes a good balance between a ripe, delicious fruit character and moderately spicy, buttery themes, without the influence of oak. Good, tangy acidity supports the flavors of vanilla, Anjou pear, and marzipan that come out first in the aroma and then spread to the palate."
Chardonnay,"Overtly sweet, almost a dessert wine, with vanilla cream, pineapple jam and cinnamon spice flavors. Balanced by crisp, clean acidity."
Chardonnay,"Tan spice, like sandalwood, plays a leading role, along with a touch of Meyer lemon and marshmallow. Stone fruit notes are currently in the background, but may emerge more with time."
Chardonnay,"This is an attractively crisp, citrus-flavored wine. With lime and ripe apple fruits, the tangy texture bursts with freshness. The wine is ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"Grassy aromas include notes of citrus, apple, wheat and pool water. This feels fruity and a touch pulpy. Tropical, briny white-fruit flavors are pithy and finish light in weight, citrusy in flavor and ultimately a touch bitter."
Chardonnay,"There's a touch (17%) of new oak here, which adds flavors of caramel and vanilla to the rather tart and simple fruit. It falls into the generic yellow/green apple style, with hints of arugula."
Chardonnay,"This textured, mineral Chardonnay has fresh apple and strong citrus flavors. It is lively, crisp and ready to drink. The producer is a member of Terroirs Originels of Beaujolais and Burgundy's Mâcon."
Chardonnay,"While on the light side, this is an attractive, fruity wine. It has a creamy, soft feel to it with fresh pear flavors, as well as a touch of vanilla from the gentle wood aging. It's ready to drink now, but will be better in a year."
Chardonnay,"Golden caramelized oak supports a fleshy, full-bodied sensation of pear and fig in this bold, rich wine. Resolved on the palate and possessed of moderate acidity, it finishes in a plume of nutmeg."
Chardonnay,"Pear and apple aromas receive a kick from some creamy, vanilla-tinged oak. The palate is mostly tangerine and lime, with some rich baked-apple undertones. The lengthy finish is solid, as is the mouthfeel. Best Buy."
Chardonnay,"While relatively neutral on the nose with notes of savory apple and pear, the palate is deeply earthy with flavors of mushroom and dried herb. Light in body and alcohol, it's brisk on the palate with a streak of lemon-lime acidity."
Chardonnay,"This offers great value for the quality, a mix of salty brine, stone and caramel apple that delves into more voluptuous dabs of pineapple. Light-bodied and food-friendly, it shows focused acidity and restrained oak."
Chardonnay,This medium-bodied wine is well rounded in texture. The touch of sweet pear in the flavors gives counterpoint to herb and fennel aromas and some citrusy acidity.
Chardonnay,"Ripe apple and banana flavors lead this native yeast-fermented, oak-aged wine. Its loose-knit mix of fruit seems on the cusp of oxidation and is countered with tart, lemony acidity."
Chardonnay,"Dried lemon rind, ripe apple blossom and lime-soaked honeydew aromas show on the nose of this bottling from the team behind Villa San-Juliette. It's simple on the palate, with very drinkable flavors of tangerine juice and caramelized almonds."
Chardonnay,"With its balance of sweetness and acidity, this is a delicious wine that hints at honey as well as pear and ripe melon. There is a touch of wood in the background to give the wine further complexity."
Chardonnay,"Toasty wine, maybe over-toasty, giving a buttery malolactic feel. Its acidity and its freshness are both enveloped in a more opulent embrace."
Chardonnay,"Toasted nuts, seared marshmallows, roasted corn and dried apple play on the nose of this richly layered wine. The palate shows plenty of lively sea salt from front to back, along with concentrated citrus character and an apple-syrup ripeness."
Chardonnay,"This is a lovely wine, with flavors both rich and racy—cool minerality meets ripe lemon/lime, with a dollop of creamy custard. It's mouthfilling and smooth, with lingering, delicious flavors that resonate beautifully."
Chardonnay,"Deliciously fresh, this is almost delicate, certainly elegant. There is great balance here, the wood just lightly toasty over the smooth, creamy white fruit flavors. For a wine from a lesser Burgundy appellation, this is impressive."
Chardonnay,"A fairly standard Chardonnay, rich in oak, lees and ripe citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but raised up by brisk acidity and a fine minerality that gives it extra complexity. It's rich with honey and brown sugar, but doesn't feel cloying."
Chardonnay,"All the essential elements of a mainstream California Chardonnay come together in this medium-bodied wine, from a buttery and vanilla-like aroma to ripe pear flavors and accents of nutmeg. The texture is smooth and lingering, with an almost sweet finish."
Chardonnay,"Very dry and steely, this offers crisp acidity plus butter and wood flavors that bring out citrus as well as white peach fruits. With five years aging, it is ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"This new project focusing on specific blocks of the historic Cambria Vineyard on the Santa Maria Bench starts with very subtle and restrained aromas of nectarine, lemon cream and a hint of grapefruit pith. The palate is fresh with lime and toasted coconut flavors, held up by a backbone of strong acid that keeps it from spilling toward overripe qualities."
Chardonnay,"Aromas of butter, vanilla, corn silk and tropical fruit lead to barrel-forward, oak-laden pineapple flavors that intertwine through the finish. For the style, it's well done but the oak is pretty intense."
Chardonnay,"White flower perfume and rain-soaked concrete scents make an interesting and appealing nose on this wine from the summits of the Santa Cruz Mountains. There is tight, barely ripe nectarine on the palate and a bright freshness, making it a perfect partner for shellfish or counterpoint to aged cheese."
Chardonnay,"Light on the nose, it feels tangy in the mouth, with sharp flavors of mustard, brine and lime. This finishes with a pickled flavor."
Chardonnay,"There's a world of lemon chiffon and vanilla crème brûlée in this wine, both aromatically and in taste. Medium weight and well-balanced, it delivers a hit of tart lemon on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Overpowering, intense barrel aromas are resiny and fully toasted. This oaky Chardonnay is flush and textured in the mouth. Flavors of resiny, raw wood are front and center, followed by woodspice and hickory. A final heaping of oak is poured onto this wine's barrel-heavy finish."
Chardonnay,"Fruit-juice sweet, like a pineapple, orange and peach drink, with high, almost sour acidity. Gets the Chardonnay job done."
Chardonnay,"A strong hazelnut aroma meets poached pear and cotton candy on the nose of this bottling, giving a rich yet tightly woven impression. The palate is oily in texture, with walnut, dried apricot and browned apple flavors."
Chardonnay,"A savory, lightly herbal aroma and somewhat meaty flavors like canteloupe make this wine a bit different than the norm. Light bodied and lean in texture, it's crisp with acidity, with tangy flavors last on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Rich and fine, if a little too sweet and oaky. But those are the popular tastes in Chardonnay, and Kunde delivers. The fruit is potent in pineapple jam and Key lime pie."
Chardonnay,"A structured, cool wine that is poised and elegant, it has a lightly creamy texture cut by apple and pear flavors. Definitely mineral, it is textured with fruit skins and flavored with the oak aging. It needs to be aged, so don't drink before 2016."
Chardonnay,"New oak and ripe fruit combine to produce a user-friendly Chardonnay that's made in the popular style. It's enormous in pineapple, orange, mango and vanilla flavors that are brightened by crisp Carneros acidity."
Chardonnay,"This broad wine is soft, indistinct and suffers from overripe fruit. It needs a shot of acidity to give it life and interest."
Chardonnay,"There is a great balance here between the creamy fruit and the wood flavors. Apricots, ripe apples and melon are spiced with the right amount of toastiness. The wine has a rich, warm feel. It is still young, so wait until 2015 to drink."
Chardonnay,"With its upfront, ripe apple and pear flavors, this wine is immediately attractive. Behind the fruitiness, there is a firm, structured character of minerality and a steely edge, which makes this a Chardonnay to age for 3–4 years."
Chardonnay,"Brûléed banana and peach lead the aromatics and flavors of this French oak-aged Chardonnay blended with 15% Petit Manseng. A rich, creamy palate is balanced by a tart pineapple and lemon-curd vein, moving to a toasted vanilla finish."
Chardonnay,"This is soft, full of ripe white fruit flavors. The wine is broad, showing some freshness along with the forward richness. It is likely to age relatively quickly."
Chardonnay,"Pretty standard stuff here, with thin, watery aromas that carry only faint traces of wood and apples, and watery flavors. It's clean, but hot from alcohol, with high acidity. —S.H."
Chardonnay,"Dark golden-yellow, this opens with inviting notes of toasted caramel. It remains bright in citrus on the palate, getting riper and steamier as it goes, developing deeper, richer flavors of preserved lemon and baked pear. From the winery's estate, this is a small-production wine well worth seeking."
Chardonnay,"Not much going on in this sweet Chardonnay except toothpicky oak, vanilla and watered-down peach juice."
Chardonnay,"A soft wine with attractive fruitiness and lemon and lime flavors. Fresh and rounded, it shows its northern French origins with the tight acidity at the end."
Chardonnay,Fresh and inviting with assertive notes of pineapple and sweet citrus backed by fleshy pear and melon accents on the nose and mouth. The palate offers zippy acidity with a clean lift to the finish. Drink now.
Chardonnay,"This is a ripe wine, full of apple and apricot fruit with a strong citrus line. A touch of minerality adds tangy texture and gives this rich wine plenty of life and freshness. Drink from 2015."
Chardonnay,"Gregory Graham's first Lake County Chardonnay, this wine has notes of vanilla custard, lemon and toasty oak."
Chardonnay,"The nose announces a resiny, oaky wine. What you don't get from the bouquet is how direct and acidic it is in the mouth. Flavors of citrus and wood are tart and clumsy, while the finish brings a blast of short-lived citrus flavor."
Chardonnay,"Earthy aromas of Chardonnay fruit and toast lead on this wine with a   somewhat prickly character. Lean and simple, it wants more spice and a softer mouthfeel to make it work."
Chardonnay,"At about four years of age, Talbott's '04 tastes overripe. It has the aromas and flavors of a botrytized, late-harvest Chardonnay, brimming with apricot jam and pineapples, except that it's bone dry. With the very high acidity, this makes it unbalanced and not entirely enjoyable. This is a bottling that seems to do better in cooler vintages."
Chardonnay,"This is the inaugural release for Browne Family Chardonnay. Crisp and leesy, it has a smooth, creamy midpalate, with a buttered toast highlight. Refreshing acidity and excellent length keep it fresh and lively."
Chardonnay,"Polished and sophisticated, with lush green apple, pineapple, buttered toast and cinnamon flavors. Likeable for its balance and sheer drinkability."
Chardonnay,"This is a taut wine, touched by yeast and warmed by ripe yellow fruit. Flavors of melon and spice from the new wood give it an open feel. It's ripe, already rounded and full bodied."
Chardonnay,"Too sweet and oaky, with sugary vanilla and pineapple jam flavors. Could be a Starbucks drink. Saved a bit by crisp acidity."
Chardonnay,"Ripe tropical and citrus fruits mingle in this medium-bodied wine. There's a lick of toast and a hint of marmalade, but ultimately it's a bit simple and lacking energy."
Chardonnay,"A wine that brings out all the minerality of Puligny. That makes it taut and structured but at the same time the fruit element plays a vital part. With citrus and apple skin, layered with fresh green plums, this is both complex and deliciously fruity. The vanilla flavors from wood aging round out the wine."
Chardonnay,"Delicately sparkling, this creamy Champagne is crisp, fruity and on the dry side of Brut. It has citrus as well as pear flavors giving a fruity edge to the lively texture. This delicious wine should age a little longer, so drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,"This yellow-looking Chardonnay smells briny and like oily popcorn. The palate is both watery in feel and resiny. Nutty, salty flavors of popcorn crowd out apple notes, while the finish is dilute."
Chardonnay,"In this wine, a core of juicy apple and Anjour pear flavors is dressed with light vanilla, nutmeg and cream accents for a beautiful, airy wine that's dry and not at all heavy. Baking spices linger on the long, vibrant finish."
Chardonnay,"This wine has a creamy, smooth character. Lightly buttery and with some ripe pear flavors, it is soft, refreshing and ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"Ripe with yellow fruits and soft acidity, this is a smooth and creamy wine. It also has a more textured character giving a crisper edge that leaves a tangy aftertaste. Drink this rich wine now."
Chardonnay,"Apple cider, orange rind and a touch of toast unfold on the nose, while the medium weight and juicy mouth offers more fresh red apple flavors. The finish is simple but clean."
Chardonnay,"Almost always distinctive, and this year has unusual flair and finesse. Shows a Chablisian style of mineral, warm stone, and citrus, but with far richer streaks, like gold embedded in flint. Oak and lees are elegantly applied. More foodworthy than most California Chards."
Chardonnay,"Bright aromas of vanilla, toast and wood spice lead to a full-bodied, rich palate. The style gets out in front of the fruit but there's still much to enjoy."
Chardonnay,"This is oaky and resiny on the nose, but not overly so, with pear and apple aromas as well as a streak of saline. On the palate, this offers a good mix of oak resin, fruit pulp and acidity. Flavors of oak spice, white pepper, peach and apple finish fresh but with an oaky aftertaste."
Chardonnay,"This Chardonnay straddles the line between complexity and simplicity, with toasty orange and pineapple flavors brightened with citrusy acidity. Savory minerality adds interest and food friendliness."
Chardonnay,"A wonderful nose mixes pineapple/tropical fruits, honeysuckle and some spicy herbs. The crisp and clean flavors are of green berries, melon and vanilla. Best Buy."
Chardonnay,"From vines aged between 40 and 80 years, this is a lightly wood-aged wine, with yellow fruits that go with the spicy toast. Full, ripe, and nicely cut with acidity, it has a creamy, smooth texture. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Creamy, smooth and rich, this gorgeous bottling offers flavors of lemon mousse, apricot and vanilla, backed by well-integrated acidity and fruity concentration."
Chardonnay,"This smells and tastes like vanilla, mango and honeysuckle. While the alcohol level is relatively modest, it is apparent."
Chardonnay,"Sweet lemon blossoms and fresh-pressed tangerines provide the juicy core to the nose on this appellation blend, which gains aromatic complexity from the sharper orange rind and slate minerality. Sea salt and Meyer-lemon flavors meet with white peach on the palate, which is framed by a chalky grip and is very mouth-watering."
Chardonnay,"This is a beautiful wine, so crisp, taut and refreshing. It brings out the fragrance and freshness of the chalk vineyards of the Côte de Blancs, fruity with apples and citrus. Still young although already balanced, the wine will age for several years and will be ready to drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,"A gold color and oaky aromas of popcorn, buttered corn and stone fruits open this chunky, resiny, oak-heavy Chardonnay. Oaky, buttery flavors carry over from the nose, and oak spice dominates the finish on this full-bodied but not very fruity offering."
Chardonnay,"Light and fragrant, this emphasizes crisp apple and grapefruit flavors. It has a light, breezy character. Very ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"Willamette Valley Vineyards' vintner Bill Fuller planted the Draper clone vines that go into this wine at his Tualatin Vineyards in 1973. Buttery barrel flavors are immediately apparent—highlights of butterscotch, vanilla and spice around a core of ripe apple fruit. It seems to gather strength throughout the sip, with a lingering finish. Drink 2019–2030."
Chardonnay,"Expertly balanced between crisp acidity and concentrated, creamy textures, this is fresh in orange blossom and just-picked Gravenstein apple, a wisp of orange peel and other citrus bringing the wine to life. This Chardonnay has enough stuffing to age but is immensely enjoyable now."
Chardonnay,"Sourced from the Whistling Ridge Vineyard, this was previously bottled under the winemaker's Matello label. It's packed with apple and pear fruit flavors, supported with ample acidity. Smooth and fleshy, its 50% new oak remains subtly integrated, with highlights of caramel and butter peeking out. It's well balanced, but you'll note that there are tartaric crystals (utterly harmless) clinging to the cork, suggesting that it was not cold stabilized. Drink soon."
Chardonnay,"Tastes like there's a great deal of residual sugar left over, giving the wine an overtly sugary sweetness that's almost like Sauternes."
Chardonnay,"Milly-Lamartine is a village in the hills just north-west of Pouilly-Fuissé. Its style is for juicy and fruity wine like this. With hints of minerality, citrus and pear, the wine has a rounded character that is cut with acidity. Drink the wine now."
Chardonnay,"This is delicious, concentrated and showing a range of nuances; along with ripe apple and pear flavors come spicy hints of cinnamon and baking spices. Firm acids, good balance, and more texture and length than most domestic Chardonnays in this price range."
Chardonnay,"Buttercream, sweet butter, marmalade, baking spice, brown sugar and sea salt converge on the nose of this bottling, named after the Foley family's Texas ranches. Sea salt, vanilla, lemon peel and frozen-butter flavors show on the sip, which is fatter in the midpalate but cut by the savory saltiness."
Chardonnay,"A beautiful Chardonnay, creamy, dry and elegant. There's a tangy minerality underlying the rich tropical fruit, apple, pear and buttered toast flavors. This is an elegant and sophisticated wine from the Carneros region."
Chardonnay,"This attractive and fruity wine from the Côte Chalonnaise has ripe melon and sliced pear flavors along with orange zest. Full and rounded, it's ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"Aged in a majority of neutral French oak, the wine has opening aromas that impart generous toasty characteristics before mellowing into nutty, vanilla swirls and a lingering taste of green apple."
Chardonnay,"Barrel-fermented Dijon clones make for a full-bodied wine with plenty of grip. It's fruity with chewy melon and ripe peach. Just 8% of the oak was new, but light, buttery notes soften up the finish."
Chardonnay,"Previous vintages tasted more balanced than this super-oaky one. The wood erupts from the glass, suggestive of caramel, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream pie and charcoal, overwhelming what seems to be a perfectly nice wine. Some folks will love it. Others will find it the poster child of overoaked California Chard."
Chardonnay,"There is a strong pithy character to the nose of this wine, with aromas of Meyer lemon peel, grapefruit rind, Brie cheese wash, yogurt and wet rock. The palate is really tightly wound and also full of that tight pith character, with ethereal and wispy flavors of clean smoke, chalk and ash. The acidity is soft but penetrating."
Chardonnay,"Peach, pear and melon notes on the nose and in the mouth are tinged with some slightly herbal (fennel?) notes, turning tart and citrusy on the finish. It's a pleasant, medium-bodied quaff for the summer months."
Chardonnay,"Big, ripe waves of baked apple, pear and pineapple play on the palate in this rich wine, measured by a moderate helping of acidity. Quince and lime play supportive roles."
Chardonnay,"This is tight, mineral and on the dry side of Brut. The 100% Chardonnay taste signals chalky soil—crisp and fresh. A pure line of acidity cuts through the texture, giving a balanced, always dry wine that could do with more bottle aging to soften the piercing acidity at the end."
Chardonnay,"After making wine in Berkeley for just over a decade, the producer is working for the first time with Napa Valley fruit, grapes in fact farmed by grape-grower extraordinaire Steve Matthiasson. Pear, quince and grapefruit combine for a svelte sensibility, subtle in oak and sharp in acidity, with a tangy, herbal finish."
Chardonnay,"On the nose, this wine shows typical Chardonnay aromas of peach, melon and citrus, all augmented by toast and vanilla from barrel aging. But on the palate, it displays a tight, rather lean framework; there's more citrus than stone fruit, finishing crisp rather than particularly rich or nuanced."
Chardonnay,"Dijon clone again. This has just the vaguest hint of onion, but otherwise is much improved over this property's '99. There is good, juicy, crisp fruit mixing apple/apricot and light citrus. Balanced acids and a well integrated middle that leads into a somewhat hot, stiff finish. Young and edgy, but well made."
Chardonnay,"Rich and mineral at the same time, this deliciously powerful wine is open and generous. The structure is equally impressive, a steely core of minerality and tense stone fruits. The wood shows through with spice, but remains discreet. Age for many years."
Chardonnay,"Cultivated from a single vine many years ago that the then-vineyard manager believed was special, Husch's Vine One Chard is a soft, exotic wine. It combines smoky-sweet oak notes with baked apple, pear and quince flavors that finish dry and spicy."
Chardonnay,"Shows classic Chard aromas of melon and peach, amply framed by toasted grain and cereal notes that add texture in the mouth. It's medium to full in body, then develops greater zest and freshness on the long, citrusy finish. Drink now–2012."
Chardonnay,"Reflecting the warm 2015 vintage, this is smooth and creamy. It has great fruitiness, recalling yellow fruit cut with a strong citrus streak. It's a wine to drink young, from late 2017."
Chardonnay,"Fine balance is a hallmark for all Adelsheim wines. This shows a mix of citrus and apple fruit, with the tartness of gooseberries as a nod to the cooler vintage. There is some pleasing complexity, with an emphasis on herbs and high-acid fruits."
Chardonnay,"This is a simple, friendly wine with a pretty dusty, mineral quality that frames fresher aromas of pear, peach and golden apple. It's a bit toned down in terms of flavors intensity but does end on a playful spicy note."
Chardonnay,"Aged in white oak barrels from Minnesota, the winemaker's home state, this wine offers exotic honeysuckle and baked pineapple at its core, beautiful aromas that gain weight on the texture. Toasted caramel and coconut define the finish."
Chardonnay,"Made in the popular Chardonnay style, this shows buttered toast, buttercream, pineapple, mango and exotic spice flavors. Drink this rich wine now."
Chardonnay,"While oaky and smoky, this Chardonnay is packed with fleshy tropical fruit A slightly bracing feel on the finish gives it some texture. It should pair well with weekday meals or as a pass-around wine at parties."
Chardonnay,"While this wine is rich, its tight texture brings out the minerality. Yellow fruits and toast are balanced with zingy acidity for a wine that will need time to broaden out. Drink from 2021."
Chardonnay,"Assertively toasty and nutty, this is barrel-fermented in new oak, but in 500-liter puncheons, not the smaller barriques, so that the wood doesn't overwhelm. Peach, vanilla and citrus flavors completely fill the mouth, yet remain fresh and vibrant on the finish. Drink now–2012. Imported by Epic Wines."
Chardonnay,"Rich and rounded with a creamy texture, this wine is ripe with apricots and has a strongly mineral character. Full of fruit, the wine also has a texture that means it needs to age. Drink from 2021."
Chardonnay,"Savigny-lès-Beaune, better known for its reds, also makes small quantities of white. From a three-acre parcel, this wine is ripe and tangy with orange peel and mineral acidity. It is a wine that is aging fast and that will be ready to drink from late 2017."
Chardonnay,"La Carte is a small vineyard in Lugny, producing this delicious crisp fruit-driven wine. It is lively with acidity and ripe with peach and baked pear fruits. The texture is just enough to allow it to age, so drink from mid-2017."
Chardonnay,"This wine is subtle in aroma but extremely generous in texture. It seems to start out slow and then floods the palate with very ripe but not sweet flavors like kiwi, pear and honeydew melon on a nicely viscous, pillowy texture."
Chardonnay,"Sweet and simple, with flavors of buttered toast, popcorn, white sugar and pineapple jam. Crisp acidity helps for balance. It's not really a dry table wine, but it's a good example of its style."
Chardonnay,"This wine from the southern Mâcon appellation is crisp with a mineral edge as well as the ripe fruit of the vintage. It has a tangy, lemon-like texture that gives it a lift, adding to the fresh, fruity aftertaste. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Pristine Asian pear and lemon perfume on the nose of this full bodied Chardonnay take a slightly darker savory tone on the palate. The mouthfeel is rich and textured, but brambly slightly vegetal notes and a bite of astringency distract on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Its sharp grassy and gooseberry aromas are the type normally associated with Sauvignon Blanc. On the palate, grapefruit and passion fruit flavors further drive home that impression, but it's labeled Chardonnay, and that's what it is. The acidity is nice so the mouthfeel is fresh."
Chardonnay,"From a selection of vineyards influenced heavily by fog, this wine shines in fleshy, expansive stone fruit and brightly integrated flavors of apple and pear. With a focused, velvety and juicy texture, it retains plenty of balance against a backdrop of elegant richness."
Chardonnay,"A delicious lemon meringue aroma carries over to the flavors of this opulent, buttery, and plush-textured wine. It's layered, creamy and concentrated but has medium body and doesn't feel heavy. The finish is rich and sweet-seeming."
Chardonnay,"Pleasing aromas of butter, spice and apple lead to elegant, creamy-feeling flavors. It's a very tasty, very varietally correct wine."
Chardonnay,"There's a warm peach ripeness on the nose of this wine from a tiny appellation north of Santa Cruz near Bonny Doon, along with aromas of kumquat, vanilla bean and sea salt. The palate shows more peach, caramelized apples and saffron, cut with a lime-juice acidity and finishing with a dollop of vanilla-butter."
Chardonnay,"Wet, salinic, oceanic and appley on the nose, with snappy, crisp, almost tart flavors of apple and citrus. A pure wine with juicy acids and a monotone finish that sports lemon and green apple. Powerful, pure, acidic and zesty for Chilean Chardonnay."
Chardonnay,"The nose on this estate wine emerges slowly with enough sniffing, offering white peach, white flowers and honeydew. It's a fruit salad of flavors once sipped, suggesting melons and apples tossed in citrus vinaigrette."
Chardonnay,"Tastes rich and flashy now, with a rich array of oranges, pineapples and peaches, accented with oak. The acidity is just fine. Hanzell Chardonnays have a history of aging, so try stashing it for six years and see what happens."
Chardonnay,"The grapes for this beautiful wine come from a sloping, high-elevation site, coaxed into expression by Winemaker Bob Cabral. Barrel-aged 10 months in French oak, 40% of it new, it opens with touches of butter and matchstick before blowing off the doors with butterscotch, baked lemon and balanced, oaky spice. Voluptuous on the palate, this is a stunner."
Chardonnay,"A spectacular Chardonnay—this is dazzingly beautiful and mesmerizing in its appeal. The complexity of flavor stuns, offering tiers of pineapples, oranges, green apples and golden mangoes. Then the oaky influences appear in the form of buttered toast and caramel, with a suggestion of honey. The finish is dry and crisp in acidity."
Chardonnay,"Although this is certainly dry, it is not searingly so. That comes from the ripe Chardonnay and the delicious white fruits that are well integrated into the mineral texture. The wine is bright, crisp and ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"Creamy, rich and loaded with apricot and peach, this would pair well with creamy vegetable risotto."
Chardonnay,"Broad tropical fruit and nut aromas gain more focus on the medium- to full-bodied palate. The wine feels lush and plump, but solid acidity gives it some buoyancy."
Chardonnay,"Aromas of saline solution and sawdust accent generic citrus and apple aromas. On the palate, this is fresh and citrusy. A blast of sharp lemon, apple and quince flavors come before a lightweight but oaky finish."
Chardonnay,"The wood-aging flavors show strongly in this ripe wine, balancing with the apple acidity and the touches of green-plum fruits. A streak of minerality adds to the complexity of this delicious wine. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,"Here's a cheerful Chardonnay from Puglia that does a very good job of recalling the territory it comes from. You'll notice aromas of herbal butter, dried oregano, yellow fruit, honey and roasted almond that seem very specific to the southern Mediterranean. It's creamy and soft in the mouth with a fresh note of acidity on the close and is, generally speaking, easy and fun to drink."
Chardonnay,"A wine that is full in the mouth, offering some wood flavors, also some tight acidity and a final, crisp edge."
Chardonnay,"Since we last tried this wine, Catena has dialed back the new oak and pumped up the natural acidity. And the result is pleasantly akin to fine Burgundy. Now the emphasis is on refined, Dijon-style apple and peach flavors with great mouthfeel. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"This is a lovely, unadorned Chardonnay: no oak, no malo, just great fruit. The beauty and power of the Dijon clones is on full display, with penetrating citrus and apple fruit buoyed by punchy acidity that carries through a long finish."
Chardonnay,"Scents of grilled peach and mango give this medium-bodied wine a tropical feel. It's creamy and lush on the palate, then adds a mouthwatering burst of citrus on the finish. Flavorful and satisfying."
Chardonnay,"Refreshing flowers and fruit lead on the nose of this impressive Chardonnay, followed by flavors of flowers, layered fruit and a clean, acidic edge. The wine has class and character and is a perfect food-pairing choice."
Chardonnay,"It's hard to find Chardonnays priced at less than $20 that pack this much interest. This bottling offers fresh-squeezed underripe tangerine, lemon blossoms, lemon curd, crisp Gala apple, sharp grapefruit skin and a bit of butter on the nose. A salty lemon butter and marmalade flavor show on the palate, along with pear, apple and nectarine, framed by intense acidity."
Chardonnay,"A rich, fruity Chardonnay with lots of flavor and bright, mouthwatering acidity. Made sur lie, but with no oak, it has yeasty notes accenting pineapples, Asian pears, green apples, honeysuckle, cinnamon and vanilla."
Chardonnay,"The estate-grown grapes for this wine come from some of the appellation's highest-elevation sites, at the base of Mount Veeder. Natural acidity is the star of the show, a nice surprise after a decadent honeyed color and bouquet. Serious texture and complexity give way to a touch of salted caramel and peach."
Chardonnay,"Ripe fruit meets butter and spice in this medium-bodied, smooth and integrated wine. It opens with Bosc pear and golden apple aromas, melding with vanilla and marzipan notes, its richness of flavor nicely buoyed up by acidity."
Chardonnay,"Toasty on the nose, with plenty of baked apple and warmth. The palate is round, smooth and toasty, with caramel running alongside baked apple and pear flavors. Sweet on the finish, plump in feel and good overall in a tropical, fun way."
Chardonnay,"Green beans and other vegetal notes combine with pineapple, rancid butter and wet wool in this rather odd Chardonnay. There's plenty of acidity and a creamy mouthfeel, but it's all a little out of balance."
Chardonnay,"Concentrated, delicious fruit flavors and subtle spiciness make a great combination in this harmonious and full-bodied wine. There is no obvious oak character, but it tastes like a gently barrel-fermented wine that developed hints of cream, nutmeg and honey along with a river of ripe pear and peach."
Chardonnay,"Candied lemon peel, Asian pear and marzipan hints show on the slightly oxidative nose of this bottling from Jim Clendenen. Ripe apple and pear flavors mark the palate, along with a warm toast component, but a Meyer lemon tang and bitter orange accents cut the richness."
Chardonnay,"Sourced from Sagemoor Farms and the Homestead estate vineyard, this detailed and complex wine opens with pear and pineapple scents and flavors, then layers in pretty spices and toasty highlights."
Chardonnay,"Ripe, creamy wood aged wine, this is rich and smoothly textured. It has weight, apple and pear flavors. Full in the mouth, it may be missing out on the freshness in favor of power."
Chardonnay,"A trail of smoke wafts from start to finish on this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay from Fox Run. Refreshing and lean on the palate with an abundance of fresh apple flavors, it's bright and clean with a lemony acidity that shines."
Chardonnay,"Slightly astringent, textural tones of citrus rind, apple peel and almond skin are supported by rich notes of pineapple and mango. The medium-weight palate is zingy and refreshing, with an orange-zest flavor and soft toasty character on the close. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"San Francisco-based winemaker Ed Kurtzman heads to this famed vineyard south of Salinas to create this restrained bottling from a region where power and richness usually reign. Flint, Meyer lemon, honeysuckle and grapefruit aromas show on the nose. The palate offers nectarine, white peach and Asian pear flavor, proving delicate but not shy."
Chardonnay,"Superripe in fruit and superoaky, this is a big, lush, powerful Chardonnay, but for all the size, it maintains balance and elegance. Potent in smoky, vanilla-accented pineapple brûlée, exotic date and stony mineral flavors, it shows the crisp acidity the vineyard is known for, and finishes dry and spicy."
Chardonnay,"Almost as good as some of the winery's best single-vineyard bottlings, this wine has a tremendous nose that offers tangerine blossom, pink grapefruit skin, sea salt and toast around a line of graphite. The palate presents juicy nectarine and ripe citrus alongside yeasty sizzle, salt and a chalk minerality."
Chardonnay,"This light, fresh Chardonnay has lively pear and apple flavors. A crisp texture gives zing to the brightly fruity wine. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Aromatic and ripe, this Chardonnay has creamy pear and apricot flavors, plus touches of wood and a warm, rich mouthfeel. It has a soft character, a hint of acidity and lemony freshness."
Chardonnay,"This is a rich textured wine from the center of this Premier Cru. It has structure and concentration as well as generous white stone fruits. Densely packed with acidity, toast and a fine, creamy texture, the wine is likely to age well. It is produced from biodynamically grown grapes (as are all the Olivier Leflaive family Grand and Premier Crus). Drink from 2020."
Chardonnay,"Ripe aromas of melon are flabby. This is both chunky yet citrusy in feel, while flavors of orange and lemon are basic. The finish is soft but shows just enough citric acidity to keep things going."
Chardonnay,"New French oak brings plenty of buttered toast and vanilla to this sweet, rather simple Chardonnay. It's a wine with universal appeal, with bright pineapple, lemon-meringue pie and honeysuckle flavors."
Chardonnay,"Dry and well balanced but also full flavored, this will be a great go-to bubbly to have ready in the fridge for any minor or major occasion. There are ripe fruits along with crisp citrus notes, lively acidity, a rich mousse of bubbles and lingering finish."
Chardonnay,"Crispness provides the balance needed for this Chardonnay. It gives a tartness to the fairly sweet, candied flavors of pineapples and butterscotch."
Chardonnay,"Lots of bang for the buck in this rich, fruity Chardonnay. It hits it right down the middle in solid popular appeal, with New World tropical fruit, citrus and peach flavors wrapped into a buttercream texture and liberally accented with smoky oak."
Chardonnay,"Not bad for basic Argentine Chardonnay. The nose has banana and tropical fruit aromas to go with dried hay, while the soft-bodied palate has enough acidity to keep it flowing. Flavors of melon, banana and vanilla are solid even though it flattens out and shows mild bitterness on the finish."
Chardonnay,"This unoaked effort sure tastes sweet, with flavors of sugared orange, mango and apple juice. The acidity is fine, giving balance to the sweetness."
Chardonnay,"A good, restaurant-style Chardonnay at a fair price for the quality. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with pleasant flavors of pineapple, kumquat, lime, vanilla and buttered toast."
Chardonnay,"This wine is light and fruity with citrus and red apples. It misses out on crispness, giving a more rounded character. It should be kept for a few months and drunk from 2017."
Chardonnay,"This wine is hyperbright in acidity, with a lemony tartness that's pleasing on the palate. Its use of oak is subtle and integrated, allowing for a layering of peach cobbler to be introduced."
Chardonnay,"This hews to a leaner, minerally style remniscent of Chablis. It's bone dry and tart, with a streamlined mouthfeel, but there's nothing shy about the intense core of limes, kiwi fruits and Meyer lemons. A beautiful wine, whose modest alcohol level makes it particularly delicate."
Chardonnay,Aromas of apple juice and melon are pleasant. This wine shows adequate balance. Peach and melon flavors finish with creamy weight and a mild note of pyrazines.
Chardonnay,"This was my top Mexican white wine from a recent tasting. It's light and clean on the nose, with apple and just a touch of brininess. This shows off a good body with weight and acidic balance. Pear, papaya and dry melon are the key flavors, followed by vanilla and toast on the finish."
Chardonnay,"This is a young, perfumed wine with honey, pear and melon flavors. Along with its crisp lemon edge, there is a more mineral, tangy, aftertaste, a feeling of steel on the tongue."
Chardonnay,"This has the look and feel of a fine white Burgundy, with expressive acidity, pinpointed oak, rich creaminess and a certain stony minerality. Yet the fruit is pure California, tropical and succulent. The wine is from the Pisoni family."
Chardonnay,"This is largely neutral on the nose except for lazy flowery, tropical aromas. Fairly bold in size and mouthfeel, it has honeyed flavors of nectarine and peach. On the finish, it's more bitter than fresh as the fruit character breaks down."
Chardonnay,"Very much in line with SEV's fine 2009 Chardonnay, this is sourced from the Lewis Vineyard. Instantly round and fruity, it offers up a ripe mix of oranges and apricots, backed with juicy acidity. Then it brings in the butter, toast and nuts—a full-bodied, extremely generous wine."
Chardonnay,"Warming spices of cinnamon and clove with a touch of orange give this Chardonnay a unique appeal. Full of depth and dimension, the wine still has a light, deft touch. Pair with earthier, more complex dishes or enjoy alone."
Chardonnay,"There's the slightest touch of oxidation on the nose of this wine, with aromas of roasted walnut and seared lemons. The palate is quite interesting, with lemon oil, hints of toasted nuts and a faint marshmallow element on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Good and dry, with a firm scour of acidity and an earthiness to the pineapples and pears. This is a fine everyday Chardonnay at a fair price."
Chardonnay,"This extra brut is a quintessential Franciacorta, offering a fragrance of white and yellow flowers and a whiff of citrus. The palate delivers ripe Golden Delicious apple flavors, accented with hints of hazelnut, along with a creamy texture supported by crisp acidity."
Chardonnay,"Strong aromas of pear cider, ripe apples, honey and a slight nuttiness show on the nose of this bottling. That cider flavor continues into the sip, where browned apples and sour-lime flavors show most prominently."
Chardonnay,"Creamy and crisp—a nice trick—this refreshing Chardonnay livens up the palate with a mix of herb, celery, apple and Asian pear, rolling into a finish of caramel apple and toast. It has a light touch despite the 14.5% alcohol, and sits nicely in the back of the throat, inviting another glass."
Chardonnay,"Crisp and fresh, this is a tangy, lemon and orange zest flavored wine. Lively acidity bursts through the richer white fruits, green plums and quince spiciness. Both fresh and ripe, it's well balanced. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"A very evenly made Chardonnay, this shows all the expected notes of poached apples, Anjou pear skins and lemon-lime freshness. There is decent acidity to the sip, presenting flavors of candied Key-lime peels, tangy tangerine and grapefruit pith."
Chardonnay,"Pithy aromas of melon and apple are low in oak and emphasize minerality. This feels full and chunky, but also acidic. Briny flavors of stone fruits lean toward sour, while an oily, briny tasting finish is short on elegance."
Chardonnay,"Unusually for a Champagne from the Montagne de Reims, better known for its Pinot Noir, this is a 100% Chardonnay. It is ripe and fruity—a warm wine with apricot and spice as well as crisper citrus. Drink this smooth wine now."
Chardonnay,"Fleshy fruits of white peach and guava and fragrant white flowers trend tropical on the nose of this bottling, but are cut by green apple and citrus skin flavors. The palate is broad with guava cream, apple blossoms, mango and lime chiffon flavors. Quite tasty, but very tropical."
Chardonnay,"Fine and fresh, brightened by grapefruit, lemon zest and bright acidity, this is a delicious wine, ready for seafood, finishing so clean and crisp."
Chardonnay,"A bold Chardonnay that embraces new oak barrels and has the flavor profile to show for it. Hovey fermented it in 50% new oak barrels, matured it on the lees and bottled it a few months after harvest. The scent and flavor of toasted oak comes through from the first sniff to the finish. But enough fruit, butter and almond flavors lie beneath the toasty overlay to make us come back for another sip."
Chardonnay,"Fermented in large French-oak barrels, Sannino's regular-label Chardonnay has a slightly rounded, open-knit feel. It's not a deeply complex wine but offers straightforward red apple flavors backed by a hint of spice. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Light aromas offer notes of apple and pear. The palate of thhis wine is cleanly made, showing no obvious new-oak impact. It's a straight-down-the-fairway interpretation of this variety."
Chardonnay,"Acidity marks this bone dry, tightly wound and young Chardonnay. It's quite ripe in orange, pear, apricot and nectarine fruit, with an elegant mouthfeel. Give it some airing before serving, and it should drink well over the next 5–6 years."
Chardonnay,"Small amounts of Riesling, Viognier, and Gewürztraminer (3% each) considerably boost the aromas giving notes of peach, dried pineapple and flowers. Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, the flavors are light in style with a lemony lick on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Friendly, ripe green and yellow apple notes appear on both the nose and palate of this wine. Ripe but fresh acidity enlivens its easy, juicy, textured midpalate. Its clean, sunny and fruity finish makes it a pleasure to sip."
Chardonnay,"Very fresh and crisp initially, this wine then develops a richer, denser character. Lime and lemon acidity cuts through the rich pear and white plum fruits, giving texture and structure. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Tasted just after bottling, the wine was a little bottle-shocked, but should be fine by Summer 2010. Rich and creamy, with complex tropical fruit, buttered toast, lemondrop candy and honeysuckle flavors. An amazing 111,000 cases were produced."
Chardonnay,"The winery's style is a leaner, more minerally and elegant Chardonnay, rather than the blowsy, ripe kind so popular these days. This '09 is quite fine, with brisk acidity and a steely tang to the orange and apricot flavors. Drink over the next three years with shellfish in cream and butter sauces."
Chardonnay,"So sweet in pineapples and oranges despite a crisp spine of acidity, it quickly palls, making it hard to take a second sip. But lots of Chardophiles will like it."
Chardonnay,"Sweet and fruity, this canned wine feels soft and syrupy, with sugary pear as the primary flavor on the palate. It's a basic white wine in a convenient package."
Chardonnay,"This simplest, freshest and lightest of Chablis styles has a refreshing lemon character, a light touch of melon and crisp acidity. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Wallulla Vineyard provides the majority of the fruit for this Chardonnay. The lemon verbena and floral aromas and flavors are dialed way down here, with full malolactic fermentation providing a creamy feel."
Chardonnay,"The underlying fruit has flavors that veer toward green apple tart, with the baked, sweet taste of pie crust. Acids are crisp and uplifting. A generous overlay of oak and lees adds the final touches of buttercream and a rich texture to this nice, foodworthy wine."
Chardonnay,"A vivid yellow-gold color and creamy, butterscotchy flavors pile up the richness in this full-bodied wine. Great underlying acidity lifts up the wine for good balance and a lasting, tingly finish. The concentration and creaminess are wonderful to taste."
Chardonnay,"Good for Argentine Chard but not worth the price. It starts with mellow peach and apricot aromas, which are followed by melon, papaya and banana flavors. Easygoing in terms of feel, with a creamy, sweet finish. A typical South American tropical Chardonnay."
Chardonnay,"This generous, fruity and lightly sweet wine should please a crowd with its butter and vanilla aromas, rich apple, pear and baking-spice flavors and rounded mouth-filling texture."
Chardonnay,"Tart and jammy, with acidic, one-dimensional flavors of pineapples, vanilla and butterscotch."
Chardonnay,"Doesn't seem to have much, if any, oak on it, but it doesn't matter, because the underlying wine is so good, at such a nice price. Crisp and steely, it shows rich flavors of pineapples, apricots, tangerines and pears."
Chardonnay,"Mild fruit and vanilla flavors and a smooth, soft texture give this medium-bodied wine a soothing personality."
Chardonnay,"Tropical ripeness teases on the entry of this wine, before its lush, fleshy texture takes over. Its golden apple, pear and mango flavors combine effortlessly, while an underlying minerality plays upon the palate."
Chardonnay,"Quite grassy in aromas for a Chardonnay, this wine shows lemongrass, fennel, Gala apple and light honeydew melon on the nose. The palate is light and tight, with flavors of grapefruit and apples."
Chardonnay,"In the explosion of unoaked Chards lately, the Central Coast has proved itself as the go-to region. Domaine Alfred's bottling is just super, a rich, zesty wine whose acidity makes your palate dance to the music of tangerines, limes, kiwis and pineapples."
Chardonnay,"Dark gold in color, this estate wine from hillside vines aged 11 months in one-third new French oak. Salty brine takes center stage before an unctuous pillow of caramel and honey rides along a full-bodied richness of flavor. A bright spark of lemony acidity marks the finish."
Chardonnay,"Smooth and subtle, this luscious wine emphasizes a rich mouthfeel over modest fruit and spicy components. Mild and complex vanilla, coconut and pear-tart flavors are there, coming out with time as the gorgeous texture coats the palate and extends the finish for a long time."
Chardonnay,"This wine from a parcel in the Fourchaume vineyard is a step up from the Fourchaume premier cru wine. That's because it has an extra edge of minerality, of apple skins and tight, ageworthy green fruits. With its final burst of acidity, this will certainly mature over the next 3–4 years."
Chardonnay,"Very rich and opulent. You can taste how the grapes had a long season to grow enormously ripe, delivering flavors of pineapples, pears and golden mangoes. Yet the cool vintage also preserved vital acidity. A delightful young Chardonnay for drinking now with upscale fare."
Chardonnay,"Dominated by wood, it offers heavy oak and toasted sensations with a hint of butterscotch alongside fresh acidity, but it lacks fruit richness."
Chardonnay,"Very smooth, almost thick, this is a rich wine in flavor and mouthfeel. It practically oozes over the palate, dripping with ripe pineapple, vanilla and cream, and coats every corner of the mouth before lingering through a long finish. It's full bodied, soft and concentrated."
Chardonnay,"Over the top in oak, a clumsy attempt to lure in consumers with vanilla and caramel flavors that have little to do with Chardonnay. It's already turning old and tired."
Chardonnay,"Lemon shave ice and hints of white peach make for crisp, clean, and pinpoint precision on the nose, which trends toward ripe with a butter element in the background. The palate shows citrus energy, from salty lemons to lime zest, with a touch of browned butter and cream throughout the sip."
Chardonnay,"Like most unoaked Chardonnays, this is a bit simply fruity, but it's also clean and fresh. Apple, melon and citrus flavors are easily carried by its medium body and mouthwatering finish."
Chardonnay,"This reserve-level wine is sublime in stone fruit and lime as well as pear. The oak used for aging this wine was all neutral, and the taste and impact of it is unobtrusive. While vibrant in fruit, it also offers richer hints of caramel and graham cracker in complex and balanced ways, ending with persistence."
Chardonnay,"Peach and lemon combine in this superripe Chablis. Reflecting the warm vintage, the wine is soft, laced with lime juice acidity and hinting at vanilla and thyme. Round and warm, it is not typical Chablis, much more akin to a Meursault."
Chardonnay,"This is old vine (1978), Wente clone Chardonnay, with bright, spicy fruit flavors of banana, pear and melon. A touch of toast and cracker comes from barrel-fermentation in neutral French oak. Forward and rich, this is one to drink up while it's young and fresh."
Chardonnay,"Not a bad price for a rich, creamy Chardonnay. It's sweet in brown sugar, orange and pineapple jam and vanilla flavors that appeal to the popular style."
Chardonnay,"For now, the full, smoky hit of new oak fills nose and palate, while fresh citrus manages to get through here and there. The palate reveals a creamy saltiness but is currently dominated by the wood flavors and still needs to integrate and combine, wait for at least a year."
Chardonnay,"Superrich in pineapple, lime, kiwi and tropical fruit flavors, this lovely Chardonnay has a rich, balanced overlay of sweet, smoky oak. A blend of Lynmar's various vineyards, the wine's brisk acidity and minerality shine through, making the richness bright and clean. A brilliant Chardonnay to drink now."
Chardonnay,"This well-priced sparkler opens with aromas of toast, yellow apple, nut butter and a hint of honey. On the palate, fine bubbles and crisp acidity balance the pear, citrus zest and roasted walnut flavors."
Chardonnay,"Lightly buttered popcorn aromas are cut by lime blossoms, sea salt and jasmine on this delicate while extremely fragrant nose. A laser-like acidity slices through the palate, where pan-seared apple flavors are lifted by lemon pith, mandarin orange skins and orange blossoms."
Chardonnay,"A citrus-dominated wine, lime and lemon giving a crisp intensity. There is a somewhat bitter toast element, but the acidity, the fresh fruits and the soft structure act as a counter-balance. Give it six months to a year. Screwcap."
Chardonnay,"Heavily oaked, with aromas of popcorn and sawdust. The palate is a touch resiny, but underneath the oak veneer you'll find some ripe apple flavors. The creamy, long finish leaves a somewhat thick and bulky impression, but there's enough vital acidity to save it."
Chardonnay,"From the winery's estate, this wine opens in pretty floral notes of jasmine and orange blossom, following on the full-bodied palate with baked pear and vanilla. It finishes tart and dry."
Chardonnay,"Light lemon and vanilla flavors and a creamy texture make this wine easy to drink. The body is on the light side, too, with soft acidity and a mouthfeel that's not too thick."
Chardonnay,"If, at first sip, this seems delicate, that's an illusion. Reticent would be a better word, for this is a wine that is still youthful, with the toast and crisp acidity acting as a framework to the rich green and white fruits that are developing. Keep for 4–5 years."
Chardonnay,"This crisp, fruity wine is packed with acidity as well as citrus flavors. It has a cool feel, beautifully fresh and with a strong mineral element. Drink this structured, textured wine from 2019."
Chardonnay,"Mike Dobrovic, winemaker at Mulderbosch, coaxes a blend of open rich fruit with a spine of steel from his fruit. The wine is definitely New World in style with its creamy wood flavors, yet it also has the ability to age, which is more Burgundian in character."
Chardonnay,"This shows that apricotty, botrytised aroma and flavor often found in Santa Lucia Chardonnays from the cooler parts of the appellation, but it's not at all sweet. Instead, it's a bone-dry wine, with vibrant acidity."
Chardonnay,"Melony aromas come with a heavy blast of brine. This feels oily and marginal, with salty, briny flavors of orange and lime that finish disjointed before falling off."
Chardonnay,"Ripe fruit aromas show alongside an equally rich, creamy palate. This wine has attractive lemon and crisp apple flavors, touched by wood to give a smooth, rich aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,"Smoky and with strong wood flavors, this wine also has an attractive crisper edge that gives it a bright character. A lively wine, it's both rich and crisp. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Soft and fruity, this has a bright, crisp backdrop of apple and pear fruits that are given a tight texture by minerality and lemon zest. It's a wine to drink soon, best from the end of 2015."
Chardonnay,"Made by major Chablis producer Jean-Marc Brocard, this wine is ripe, soft and attractively fruity. It has crisp acidity along with rich yellow fruits and a touch of minerality. The wine comes from a blend of different premier cru vineyards. Delicious and refreshing, it is ready to drink now."
Chardonnay,"Honeyed in character, this has notes of toast, sweet tropical fruit and lemon, with light acidity. The wine feels warm, ripe, open and drinkable now."
Chardonnay,"Dominated by oak, this simple Chardonnay has woody notes with underlying citrus, apricot and tropical-fruit flavors that are a tad thin."
Chardonnay,"The nose on this Chardonnay is quite attractive with notes of mango and musky florals accenting aromas of apples and sugar cookies. The dry, medium-bodied palate is a bit more subdued, with subtle apple and pear flavors accented with soft acidity. Finishes a bit short, but has a hint of spice."
Chardonnay,"This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food."
Chardonnay,"Full and softly fruity, it has a rich feel, heightened by ripe apricot flavors. It's generous, but needs to develop to give greater definition. Drink from 2015."
Chardonnay,"Mouth-watering in its bright, pear juice freshness, this is a crisp and lemony wine, touched by cream with a tight texture layered by wood. The acidity is crisp, dominant."
Chardonnay,"Blended with 10% Viognier, this wine brings notes of flowers and peach while showing little oak influence. A touch of residual sugar sweetens the finish."
Chardonnay,"Rued Ranch consistently is the winery's top bottling. The 2011, like its predecessors, is modest in alcohol but vast in citrus, tropical fruit, honeysuckle and mineral flavors, and enriched with smoky oak and buttery notes. It has a delicate mouthfeel that makes it a joy to savor."
Chardonnay,"Shows the typicity of the vineyard, an angular, minerally wine with crisp acids and concentrated flavor. The tastes of white peaches, pineapples and tangerines are edged with zesty spices. Finishes with vanilla-honey coating of toasty oak."
Chardonnay,"Tolosa may be the only vineyard to produce two unoaked Chardonnays in the same vintage. Their '11 Central Coast is quite good. This one, from estate Edna Valley fruit, is even better. With keen acidity and a brisk minerality, it shows complex flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits, and hints of riper, richer tropical fruits."
Chardonnay,"This is a dialed-down, vibrantly bright and citrusy wine, tart in green apple. Integrated oak provides texture and waves of body in a lighter-styled package. Fermentation and maturation of the wine took place in new as well as seasoned French oak and stainless steel tank."
Chardonnay,"Golden hay in color, this clonal exploration imparts light-bodied peach, graham cracker and orange flavors, the latter showing prominently on the nose. Bright acidity keeps it youthfully refreshing, with both body and weight in balance."
Chardonnay,"Brisk lemon and apple notes are delicate and unassuming on the nose, making the blossomy, peachy palate on this Chardonnay a pleasant surprise. Despite its bold alcohol, zesty acidity lends freshness and the finish is invigoratingly mineral."
Chardonnay,"Complex and rich, this is full of tangy fruits, with a dense structure that brings out weight, minerality and a chewy core of zesty citrus. It very crisp and fruity at this stage and needs to develop its many other flavors. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,"This is a fresh and full-bodied wine, with ripe yellow fruit and citrus tones—at once warm and with crisply edged. Still young, it shows a strong mineral side that will soften with time. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,"Lightly reduced aromas of pear, apple and herb lead to a bright, crisp, clean palate. The aromas don't all seem in harmony at present but the palate brings plenty of enjoyment."
Chardonnay,"From Chardonnay grown on the Montagne de Reims, this is a rich and full-bodied wine. Red apple and sweet grapefruit flavors are balanced against the steely texture and zingy minerality."
Chardonnay,"Always a compelling wine, the 2011 Upper Barn shows the estate's classic acidity and minerality that give it such linear elegance. There is, however, nothing shy about the flavors, which are an explosion of oranges, peaches, limes, honey and new oak. This wine is not for aging, so drink now through 2015."
Chardonnay,"This is a big, ripe wine, yet it showcases cool-climate-influenced citrus fruits. Lemon-lime, ginger and piecrust open to sweet citrus and vanilla, with just a touch of butter. A hint of grapefruit pith on the finish provides additional structure."
Chardonnay,"There's a lack of balance, with thin, slightly bitter fruit overriding any complexity that may have been achieved with more oak. This is not offensive, it just lacks character."
Chardonnay,"A nice Chardonnay to drink now, with rich tropical fruit, apple and pear flavors, enhanced with vanilla and smoky oak. One of the more successful Silverado Chardonnays of recent years."
Chardonnay,"This wine hails from two fine vineyard sources belonging to the Dutton family—Mill Station Vineyard and Shop Bloc—within the Green Valley AVA embedded within the boundaries of the Russian River. Dry and extracted, it exudes honeysuckle and jasmine around lush layers of lemon, ginger candy and melon."
Chardonnay,"This is a big, rich, showy Chardonnay. Barrel fermented and aged in 80% new French oak, it shows buttered toast and charry vanilla bean aromas and flavors. The fruit below is good, if a little heavy and ripe, suggesting apricots and pears. Best now in its youth."
Chardonnay,"Round and ripe, this is a balanced, complex and perfumed wine. With its acidity beautifully in place, it is fresh while also having some spice, toast and minerality. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,"This dry wine has a nice sense of reserve along with subtle lemony, earthy and milky flavors that linger on the finish. The texture has a nip of acidity and the body is light to medium."
Chardonnay,"Showing just a few hints of minerals and crispness, this Chablis is so very light. It has some citrus and green-plum flavors along with flashes of acidity. The aftertaste is surprisingly soft for such a young wine."
Chardonnay,"Rich yet structured, this village wine from Meursault is made in a taut, tight style. Its acidity pushes through the toast flavor, which creates a nervy texture. Ready to drink  in 1–2 years."
Chardonnay,"From a cool appellation, a wine that smells bright and clean, like the scent you get when slicing into a fresh peach. There's also a lot of young, toasty oak riding on top of the fruit. Long in the mouth and in the finish, this delicious wine has crisp, supporting acids."
Chardonnay,"It's always a treat to discover a good, well-made but not overpowering wine. This one has nothing in excess, just moderate and crisp fruit flavors with light spicy accents. An appetizing texture backed by good acidity leads to a clean, dry finish. This unoaked wine from northern California should be a crowd pleaser."
Chardonnay,"This is remarkable, with modest alcohol and a concentrated, ageworthy structure. Lime and pineapple flavors are enhanced with lively, gin-like botanicals. There is vivid acidity and a lick of butterscotch on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Dominated at this young stage by wood, this is a potentially rich and creamy wine. Its structure shines through, full and generous. The fruits and the acidity still have to develop, but already the wine is showing the rounded character of a great Pouilly Fuissé. It's a wine to age, so drink from 2016."
Chardonnay,"A candy-flavored wine, this is soft and missing acidity. Some spiced apple flavors are masked by the sherbet flavor."
Chardonnay,"Light-bodied and modestly priced, this is a wine for a wide circle of friends, great for midweek meals and larger weekend gatherings. Hazelnut and caramel-honey confront the senses, while the palate offers balance and zesty acidity. The finish is soft and subtle."
Chardonnay,"With a motto of “affordable luxury,” Layer Cake sources Chardonnay fruit from the fringes of pricey appellations. In this case it draws from Monterey County vineyards near the Santa Lucia Highlands and Santa Barbara County vineyard between the Santa Maria Valley and the Sta. Rita Hills. The results are solid for the price, with expressive aromas of honeydew and vanilla soda, and a palate of juicy melon and toasted oak. It is slightly boozy, so very much in the cocktail style, and is not for those afraid of oak."
Chardonnay,"Crisp green-apple freshness blends with hints of butter and vanilla for a nicely balanced, un-oaky, medium-bodied wine at a very reasonable price."
Chardonnay,"If you like a bigger, broader style, with plenty of toast and buttery goodness, this is the one for you. It spent a year in one-quarter new barrels, another eight months in neutral oak. Oily, buttery and loaded with ripe peach, pear and pineapple fruit, it's a wine to drink chilled and early, while it retains all of its innate freshness."
Chardonnay,"This is classic Washington Chardonnay, from the winery that first put it on the national map. It's beautifully built upon ripe apple, pineapple and kiwi fruit, with proportionate acid and lovely, lightly toasty oak. The alcohol is 14.3%, and the wine strikes a perfect note of weight and density, without being fat or fatiguing."
Chardonnay,"Shows plenty of finesse in the dry, minerally profile, and the crisp acidity that makes the finish clean and savory. Could be a bit richer, but the pineapple and lemon candy flavors satisfy."
Chardonnay,"Average peach and apple aromas are as good as it gets. The palate is wet, heavy, charmless and cidery, with aggressive apple and citrus flavors. And oak wouldn't likely help it."
Chardonnay,"Rich and creamy, yellow fruit ripeness over lime zest acidity. This is powerful wine, although not heavy, its acidity bursting out through the complex flavors."
Chardonnay,"Aromas of lemon-lime soda, chalk, underripe nectarine and kumquat show on the nose of this bottling from Southern California. Tangy citrus and a wet-cement minerality show through on the sip, where ripe Gravenstein-apple flavors trend toward sour stone-fruit rinds on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Young and tight, this was fermented almost entirely in stainless, with a small percentage in neutral oak. Acids are true and bright, and the fruit a mix of apple, pear and white peach. There's a little heat in the finish; an indication that this is a substantial wine that can stand up to spicier dishes—something like tandoori chicken might be just the ticket."
Chardonnay,"Crisp and high in acidity, this is bright and lean. A taste of apple is complemented by an herbal component that almost suggests cured meat, with which it would pair nicely."
Chardonnay,"Taste this wine blind, and you'd never guess it was unoaked. It has delicious and savory notes of buttered toast and vanilla. The wine is huge in tangerines, golden mangoes, Meyer lemons and ripe peaches, brightened with crisp acidity."
Chardonnay,"Beautifully oaked, this youthful, robustly expressive wine is lemony and salty, offering a high-toned minerality that plays out as stony texture. Pear and marzipan flavors dominate, accented by vanilla and nutmeg."
Chardonnay,"Salted peach, vanilla-smeared French toast and a hint of guava make for a very powerful aromatic impression on this wine from the Arroyo Grande appellation at the southern end of San Luis Obispo County. Those scents don't exactly translate to the palate, though, where the wine it a bit leaner than promised, with apple pie flavors the most dominant."
Chardonnay,"A light, subtle nose is followed by simple but elegant Chardonnay flavors and a successful play of oak and acid. The mouthfeel is equally appealing, round and supple. The wine could use more complexity but overall, is enjoyable and will be good with a variety of richer poultry and seafood dishes."
Chardonnay,"Wearing a heavy mantle of rather green, not-too-subtle oak, the fruit in this wine struggles to be noticed. Faintly apple, with earthy notes, it is fairly buried, and the wine lacks the life and dimension on the palate one seeks in a wine with reserve status."
Chardonnay,"There is a high-toned aspect to the otherwise neutral nose that just gives away lemony hints. The palate is sprightly and fresh and reveals a very creamy, fruity, almost tropical core which is cut very pleasantly by fresh, aromatic lemon—this is Chardonnay but not as you know it. A very fruity, rich but fresh number."
Chardonnay,"The wine comes from a parcel within the Bougros Grand Cru. It is tight, still very young although with weight and ripe apricot flavors. The density of the wine marks it out, its flavors running right through the texture. It finishes with fragrant, intense acidity. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,"The honey and orange aromas, rich texture, full body and late-harvest flavors add up to a bold and fruity wine. With each sip, more complexity and depth comes out, making a lasting impression."
Chardonnay,"While the Larmandier's main vineyard is in Vertus, they also have a parcel in the grand cru vineyard of Cramant. It is full of beautifully ripe fruit, beginning to round out as it ages. Green fruits and white pears, as well as yeast are still dominant; drink 2010."
Chardonnay,"It's hard not to be a big fan of Giacomo Vico's beautiful Chardonnay. The wine marries the cool-climate characteristics of the Langhe (Piedmont) with a round, opulent and rich winemaking style. You'll recognize loads of yellow fruit and rose with a playful touch of sweet vanilla."
Chardonnay,"Savory, juicy, refreshing and textured, this has a crisp green-fruit feel, and is full of bright fruit flavors. The finish continues to express the lively, tight character of the wine."
Chardonnay,"Drink this polished Chardonnay now with shellfish or chicken stew. It's crisp and minerally, with a hit of acidity backing up the citrus fruit, honey and vanilla oak flavors."
Chardonnay,"Dusty mineral tones mingle amidst zesty lemon and apple in this particularly light-bodied white. Zippy and brisk, it's a lean but properly concentrated Chardonnay that finishes with vigor and vibe. Drink now through 2019."
Chardonnay,"A big, fat, spicy wine flavored with white fruits and laced with crisp acidity. It is full and opulent, but not extravagantly so, the acidity cutting through richness, leaving yellow fruits and some toast."
Chardonnay,"Soft, smooth and buttery, this is full of ripe tropical fruits and bright, citrusy acidity. Ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"This is a beautifully pure wine with good acidity and a very crisp texture. It's all about fresh citrus while keeping a place for the tight, cool character of this vineyard. The end shows grapefruit and steeliness in equal combination. Drink from 2016."
Chardonnay,"Although the 2010 vintage was cooler than the previous two years, this Chardonnay still offers rich and luscious notes of crème caramel and baked pear. The intoxicating bouquet picks up layers of lemon zest and mineral."
Chardonnay,"This is the winery's best Dijon Clones Chardonnay ever. It shows the balanced, long hangtime fruit of the vintage, bursting with ripe flavors of pineapples, oranges, honeydew melons and pears, along with toasty new French oak and vibrant acidity. What a yummy wine to drink with scallops or crab."
Chardonnay,"Made from grapes grown in Santa Barbara County's oldest commercial vineyard, one of the region's winemaking pioneers presents aromas of citrusy meringue atop a core of toasting wood. The wood vanishes on the palate, leaving light and racy apple spritzer flavors with a grand show of minerality."
Chardonnay,"Bright, soft and attractively fruity, this is an easy, open wine. An edge of acidity and minerality give the wine a good, crisp texture. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Very similar in style and feel to the 2005 offering, Wise's 2006 Single Vineyard Chardonnay is a crisp, nicely structured wine with a preponderance of citrus and toasty oak flavors. Apple and pear notes add just the right amount of fleshiness."
Chardonnay,"One of the many vintners proud of their forthcoming Willow Creek District appellation, Bob and Jo-Ann Dunning's Chardonnay presents delicate aromas of yellow flowers, vanilla bean, peach skin and limestone. The white rocks extend to the palate, picking up nectarine elements, too, creating a lean but flavorful wine that's refreshing enough to sip all night."
Chardonnay,"Fermented and aged in barriques for six months, this retro-styled Chardonnay has aromas of toasted oak, butterscotch and vanilla that carry over to the palate along with yellow apple and citrus. You'll also notice the warmth of evident alcohol on the midpalate."
Chardonnay,"This wine is ripe, soft and fruity. The acidity, already well integrated, gives a crispness that is balanced by yellow fruits with touches of pineapple. This will be a full wine, very characteristic of the year. Drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,"Alive and dainty with soft orange blossom notes paired with fresh red apple slices and a touch of nuttiness. The mouth is more of the same, with a distinct peach pit flavor unfolding on the medium-length finish."
Chardonnay,"This wine delivers a solid hit for the popular Chardonnay style, with oak-inspired orange and mango flavors, in a creamy package. For the price, it's a good buy."
Chardonnay,"It's easy to appreciate the buttery aromas, vivid and tangy fruit like crisp apples and Bosc pears, and lively texture with appetizing acidity, elegance and raciness. It's not a big wine but a finely detailed one."
Chardonnay,"This wine is remarkably well made and memorable for its relatively large production scale, making it a great, accessible find. Integrated oak meets lifted acidity, the midpalate driven by floral and citrus highlights. The finish is light and refreshing."
Chardonnay,"This single vineyard cuvée has a lovely purity of expression. It's Fred Astaire in a bottle, with sculpted smooth apple fruit that glides across the palate. Dotted with light hints of baking spices, it finishes with a lush lingering pat of butter."
Chardonnay,"This Dijon-clone wine is well defined and complex. The mixed fruit flavors bring lime and lemon, pineapple and pear together. It's supple and long, with balanced supporting acids and a pleasing goodnight kiss of toasted marshmallows."
Chardonnay,"A big-hearted wine, packed with forward fruits, maybe dominated by the wood at this stage, but likely to become more rich as it ages. The flavors are bold, white fruits combining with lime zest acidity. For aging over the next three years."
Chardonnay,"A full-bodied wine, with some vanilla from light wood aging, rounded white fruits and a smooth texture. Touches of spice give extra interest to this fruity, open wine that is ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"Initially this may strike some tasters as an unusual expression, but give it a chance and it may well become a favorite. There's an interesting component of crushed flowers in aroma and flavor, along with nut oil, butterscotch, pineapple and apple butter. It's all supported by a mineral-driven vein."
Chardonnay,"Superripe and rich, very creamy, buttery and with a significant amount of toasty oak. The wine is open and generous, although retaining acidity and citric flavors."
Chardonnay,"A vivid bouquet of white flowers is cut by a pungent, pithy funkiness of crushed ants and iodine on this classic bottling by the Miller family and winemaker Trey Fletcher. The intriguing palate is tensely layered, with grapefruit pith, lime-sprayed limestone and a bit of almond oil on the finish, proving uniquely spicy and incredibly long-lasting."
Chardonnay,"Here's a bright young Chardonnay marked by the crisp, tingly acids that you so often find in Edna Valley wines. The fruit is vibrant, offering a burst of Meyer lemons, limes, kiwis and figs, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The alcohol level, by the way, is a relatively low 13.5%."
Chardonnay,"At first sharp and showing the influence of barrel aging in roughly 20% new French oak, this opens up and smoothes out into a supple, buttery wine. It's rich with flavors of pineapple, baked apple, sweet spices and a hint of mint. Polished and sophisticated, it generously rewards your attention with plenty of delicious details."
Chardonnay,"Strong Gravenstein and red apple and fleshy Asian pear aromas show on the sweet-leaning nose of this bottling from two vineyards in Arroyo Seco and one in Santa Lucia Highlands. Crisp apple and pear-cider notes lead into flavors of browner stone fruit, poached pear and drying apple blossoms."
Chardonnay,"A fennel note is prominent on the nose of this silky smooth and voluptuous white. Caramel-topped apple pie richness gives it an appealing personality, brightened by a lemon rind note on the finish."
Chardonnay,"With its keen acidity and mineral-dominated flavors, this currently tastes a bit austere. It also has a core of orange, apricot and mango flavors that are sweetened by oak. Don't drink it too cold, and allow it to breathe before consuming."
Chardonnay,"Stylistically, this is a racy, no-oak wine that smells of pineapple and tastes of citrus and passion fruit. The mouthfeel is citrusy, like fruit juice, with a lean, linear, citric finish that's bright in feel but tastes tangy and simple."
Chardonnay,"Here's a light, easy Chardonnay from Friuli in Northern Italy that offers measured aromatic intensity and notes of stone fruit, flowers and white mineral. The wine would wash down an easy salad thanks to its lean consistency and fresh finish."
Chardonnay,"This appellation blend from the single-vineyard-focused winery offers a great look at the region, showing a pithy nose full of Meyer lemon as well as a touch of yogurt. The mouthfeel is grippy with lots of nervous tension, which is much more interesting than the standard range of citrus flavors on display."
Chardonnay,"Clear and light in color, with noticeably bright acidity, this white becomes voluptuous on the palate, revealing a mix of caramel apple and crème brûlée around a medium-bodied texture."
Chardonnay,"An unusual Chardonnay produced from Cahors vineyards, this is an obviously wood-aged wine. Spice and toast are dominant at this stage and show that this rich wine needs time to allow the ripe tropical fruits to come through. Drink from 2016."
Chardonnay,"Simple, with jammy pineapple, mango and vanilla cream flavors that finish sugary sweet."
Chardonnay,"Seemingly sweet and simple, this has flavors of candied orange, peach and tropical fruit. A brisk hit of acidity provides much-needed balance."
Chardonnay,"Loads of peach and honey open the nose of this creamy, rich Chardonnay-based sparkling wine. In the mouth, the wine delivers sharp acidity and piquant effervescence."
Chardonnay,"Lemon curd, white peach and tangerine aromas make for a nicely rounded nose in this appellation blend. It's a very familiar Chardonnay expression on the palate, with a citrus edge that cuts through ripe pear and sea salt flavors. The mouthfeel shows chalky tension."
Chardonnay,"Made in the ripe, sweet, oaky California style, this barrel-fermented Chardonnay has flavors of pineapples, pears, peaches, buttered toast and vanilla cream, balanced with crisp acidity."
Chardonnay,"This delicious, sweet and fruit-driven wine smells like pineapple and honey. It tastes full bodied, very ripe and unctuous, and has a long, lingering finish. It will be great with salty cheeses and toasted nuts."
Chardonnay,"Ripe fruit aromas show alongside an equally rich, creamy palate. This wine has attractive lemon and crisp apple flavors, touched by wood to give a smooth, rich aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,"This Slovenian Chardonnay has aromas of orange, vanilla, toasted almonds and citrus blossom. The mouth delivers flavors of honeydew melon, pear and apple before a crisp acidic finish."
Chardonnay,"A standout in a flight of pricier Chardonnays, this young wine is tight and focused, with a pretty toasty edge. Fresh apple and white peach flavors have taken on a lot of new oak, but have the stuffing to absorb it, especially with a bit more bottle age. A lot of vanilla, custard and almond-cookie goodness fills out the finish."
Chardonnay,"Ripe and oaky, this will appeal to those who love their Chards voluptuous. It's strong in buttered toast, caramelized wood, sweet-and-sour pineapple candy and lemondrop flavors."
Chardonnay,"This is a smooth and rounded wine with ripe yellow fruits as well as a crisp, sliced apple character. It is fruity and warm with its ripe, full flavors. Drink this generous wine now."
Chardonnay,"Popcorn and nutty notes announce the ample oak, but a complex combination of mineral and baked white-fruit aromas also emerge. It feels big, layered and chunky, but with good acidity and some finesse. It tastes of candied apple, melon and sweet peach, with a fleshy finish and lasting oak."
Chardonnay,"Tight and crisp initially, this wine opens up with spice, ripe flavors and a touch of minerality. Taut and textured, it needs to age; drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,"Lithe and lean, this Chardonnay suggests a lighter-bodied, slighter expression. Zesty acidity and tart lemon-lime flavors are refreshing and thirst quenching on the palate though. The finish eases into delicate notes of spice and toast. Drink now through 2019."
Chardonnay,"Shows the usual Williams Selyem Chardonnay profile of huge fruit and flashy oak. This opulent wine would be over-the-top except that it's balanced by crisp, lemony acidity, and somehow retains a tight core with a gravitational tug that keeps the richness focused. Impressive now for sheer power, and should hold well for another 5–6 years."
Chardonnay,"Intriguing aromas of saltwater taffy, churned butter, lemon drop and cotton candy show on the dairy-powered nose of this bottling of the historic vineyard by the Duckhorn-related producer. Lemon cream and white-peach flavors show on the sip, where a strong salty character cuts through."
Chardonnay,"A strongly toasty aroma leads to a spicy, wood-laden wine. The fruit has been suppressed by the over-enthusiastic wood aging. It might soften, so wait until 2018."
Chardonnay,"Lemony-vanilla crème brûlée rises to the fore in this medium-bodied Chardonnay. Medium to high in acidity, it retains a crisp freshness throughout its layers of fruit, finishing clean."
Chardonnay,"Key lime and honeysuckle scents show on the nose of this bottling. Pithy green apple flavors and tightly wound tension mark the palate, finishing rather short."
Chardonnay,"All the Fèvre vines are at the top of this vineyard, giving very structured, long-lived wines. This is certainly an age-worthy wine, tightly coiled and nervy, with a strong mineral note at its heart. Lemon and quince flavors are caught up in the complex structure. Drink from 2020."
Chardonnay,"This crisp, delicate Blanc de Blancs is full of white fruit, but steely and citrusy on the palate. Taut, tight and complex with a layered acidity, this is a nervy, textured wine. Although it is ready to drink now, a few more months in the bottle will make it even better."
Chardonnay,The new American oak barrel fermentation and aging steals the show on this wine. Notes of vanilla and woodspice overpower the variety's melon and apple aromas and flavors. There are some good things going on but it's hard to get at them.
Chardonnay,"From the warmer Aube vineyards in the south of Champagne, this wine is rich and full of creamy fruit. There's a touch of chalky minerality to its texture, giving it a tight edge. Aged in bottle to bring out a toasty aftertaste, it's ready to drink now."
Chardonnay,"Custard and apple pie aromas lead the charge in the bouquet of this decadent wine, accented by notes of roasted nuts and orange essence. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, with just enough acidity to lift the rich fruit, honey and sweet-spice flavors. There's a beautiful evolution to the close, from lifted citrus to ripe fruit and finally sweet spice. Drink now–2019."
Chardonnay,"A decent Chardonnay, but it's pretty sweet and simple, with the taste of sugared pineapple and orange tea. Oak and alcohol of course make it more wine-like."
Chardonnay,This wine is structured and tight with minerality and zesty lemon flavors. It has a definite texture and a nervy character that needs to round out.
Chardonnay,"This is full of steely acidity as well as complex fruit. It is rich, full of toast and spice that show up the generous swathes of yellow fruits that are just beginning to show their glory. It will develop over many years. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,"While this wine does not age in wood, it does age on its lees, giving it a rich, creamy texture. It's smooth, full and soft, its apricot and peach flavors showing ripeness and openness. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,"One in a range of wines under the Xavier Flouret brand, this wine is made by Domaine Hamelin in Chablis. It is deliciously refreshing, with just the right edge of crispness to give it a lift. At the same time, its ripe, creamy texture blends with spiced-apple fruitiness. Drink the wine now."
Chardonnay,"Very light in the glass, this bottling from a very cool-climate vineyard shows a clean line of honeysuckle, crisp Asian pear and tart lime blossoms on the nose. There is great tension to the tight and tart lime-laced sip, with some nectarine ripeness in the midpalate, lots of chalky texture and a sizzle of acidity. Racy as can be, it's great now, but will last for years. Drink now through 2030."
Chardonnay,"High in acidity, and with a tangy, minerally flourish, this Chard has ripe flavors of pineapples and papayas, enriched with smoky-sweet, vanilla-accented oak. It's a fashionable wine that will go well with rich fare, such as scallops in a cream sauce."
Chardonnay,"Coming in one of the most beautiful bottles on the market, this wine offers very forward aromas of honeyed almonds, browned butter, caramelized apples, daffodils and honeysuckle. There's a marzipan-powered nuttiness on the palate along with candied apples, but lemon zest acidity holds it together. This wine overpowers white fish, but excels with cheese."
Chardonnay,"Earthy whiffs of struck flint and smoke require some aeration to blow off, but patience is rewarded with pristine grapefruit, lemon and lime notes. Light bodied and nervy in acidity, it's an elegant Chardonnay that finishes on a delightful saline tone."
Chardonnay,"This is a rich, heavy wine, a Chardonnay on steroids. It's packed with ripe and lush tree fruits, and those flavors are matched with generous barrel toast. Though it feels a bit thick on the palate, it has enough acidity to avoid being flabby and is terrifically delicious. Drink now through 2021."
Chardonnay,"Lots of toasty oak can't hide the fact that the underlying wine has a strong vegetal note, with some apricot and pineapple flavors. Tasted twice."
Chardonnay,"A fuller, richer, more broadly fruity version of the winery's Two Vines offering, this crowd-pleasing Chardonnay slathers the palate with buttery brioche, apple and Asian pear. A little more acidity would help; give it a chill to compensate."
Chardonnay,"Lemony and balanced in oak, it reveals ripe Asian pear, creamy vanilla and a swirl of toffee. Medium bodied and smooth on the palate, it features buoyant acidity. It's ideal for pairing with roast chicken or meat topped with an apple chutney."
Chardonnay,"Made entirely from Chardonnay, this is a bright sparkling wine, bubbling in acidity and dry, leavened layers of apple and pear. A creaminess of vanilla balances the crispness, making for a successful small-production sparkler."
Chardonnay,"Aged in new wood, this wine is warm and rich with spicy vanilla and apricot notes. It has green plum, yellow cherry and citrus flavors that are nicely rolled into a balanced package. It can be drunk now, but would be better to wait a year."
Chardonnay,"Tropical, thick and decidedly rich, this wine is both balanced and luxuriously fleshy, with highlights of peach, pineapple, Gravenstein apple and vanilla-kissed caramel. Full bodied, it'll still sing at the table."
Chardonnay,"This is an impressively powerful, concentrated wine. It shows its wood aging now, but those notes should integrate soon into all the ripe apricot and greengage flavors. Richly textured, this is a wine that needs aging, so don't drink before 2016."
Chardonnay,"A lovely Chardonnay to drink tonight, this one, from the winery's fine Carneros vineyard on the Napa side, shows bright, mineral-infused pineapple, lime and spicy clove and pepper flavors. The acidity will balance a rich dish, such as seared scallops in a coconut-curry sauce."
Chardonnay,"This is a densely textured wine, full of flavors of lemon zest and green apples. The intense fruitiness lights the palate with a crisp feel as well as final, tight acidity."
Chardonnay,"Standard stuff, done right. Smoke and toast aromas add nuance to scents of citrus and peach. Hints of vanilla and baking spices buttress apple and pear flavors. The wine finishes with fresh, lemony notes. This is textbook Chardonnay."
Chardonnay,"Immaculate freshness abounds in this zesty Chardonnay. While supple and quite creamy on the palate, pristine lemon and pear flavors and a vibrant backdrop of lemony acidity invigorate. Elegantly meshed vanilla and spice tones linger on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Pale straw in color, this wine brings alluring aromas of toast, spice, clarified butter and stone fruit. The palate is full bodied with sweet, generous peach and tropical-fruit flavors that sail on the finish."
Chardonnay,"A beautiful wine that asserts itself near the top of the pile of Carneros Chardonnay. Shows brisk acidity and a tangy minerality, with oak-inspired, superripe green apple, Meyer lemon and pear fruit flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Rich and oaky, with pineapple jam, tangerine juice, buttered toast and vanilla spice flavors. It's a big, opulent wine, but a little in your face. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Toast, coconut and pineapple all work the bouquet. It's zesty and healthy on the palate, with pear, coconut and baked apple flavors. Much less oaky than in the past, yet still endowed with a lot of coconut and vanilla. A very nice wine that runs ripe and sweet, as evidenced by the 14.5% alcohol."
Chardonnay,"Waxy smelling and gritty, with an oily overtone, this feels O.K. but sort of wayward, with flavors of bitter grapefruit and matchstick. Simple and somewhat sour on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Buttered toast, caramel and vanilla flavors dominate this Chardonnay. It's brisk in acidity, with mango, Meyer lemon, lime and apricot flavors, wrapped into a creamy texture."
Chardonnay,"This is a big, ripe, rich and oaky Chardonnay, the kind that will seduce lots of people with sheer dazzle, although only 135 cases were produced so it's likely to be hard to find. Dry and crisp, it's concentrated in pineapple tart and peach marmalade flavors, accented with plenty of sweet, smoky oak, and brightened with crisp Monterey acidity."
Chardonnay,"This is a big, rich Chardonnay, another monster lineup in Testarossa's single-vineyard series. Shows tightly knit apple and peach flavors very generously oaked, with the requisite additions of smoke, vanilla, and woody spices. There's something minerally in the middle that seems likely to preserve the wine, if you wish to age it. Very fine quality, and a super-good food wine."
Chardonnay,"This wine's Honeycrisp apple and Applejacks cereal scents lead the nose before bold layers of luxurious texture confirm its complexity and overall appeal on the palate. Densely packed with flavor, it also shows plenty of structure to support its powerful range."
Chardonnay,"A vivid gold color and spice-rack aromas like nutmeg and cardamom add a different twist to this medium-bodied and rather rich-textured wine. Those are probably characteristics from aging with oak, and they enhance the clean, fresh fruit flavors in a good way."
Chardonnay,"Interesting scents of spice, herb and pine mix with tropical pineapple fruit. It all leads into a buttery finish, delivering a lot of flavor for the price. Barrel fermented, malolactic and sur lie aging—the full Monty."
Chardonnay,"A decent Chardonnay for the price, with pineapple fruit and hints of butter and cream. It's medium in body, with a slightly custardy mouthfeel and a short finish. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"The lack of new oak on this wine unleashes a torrent of ripe tropical fruit, including guava, as well as ripe pear. It's briny on the palate yet with quite perfumed and pungent flavors, more typical of a Rhône white than a California chardonnay."
Chardonnay,"An unusually vivid gold color is the first indication that this medium-bodied wine will turn up the dials on flavor. Aromas resemble wood smoke, nutmeg, sandalwood and vanilla, while flavors are subtly fruity but largely oaky in the form of marzipan, toasted bread and other savory nuances. It is gorgeous in a voluptuous way."
Chardonnay,"This is a light-bodied, very fruity and soft-textured wine that smells like cherries, berries and melons and tastes fresh and a touch sweet. The acidity is low and the bubbles are lively, so it's easy to sip."
Chardonnay,"There is little difference between this and the winery's reserve. There simply is no flavor here. It's a watery, sour wine, with a finish that suggests something went wrong somewhere along the line."
Chardonnay,"Initial scents of cedar, wood-grilled apple, popcorn and orange creamsicle are intensely decadent, promising a lush and textural wine. Those notes carry through to the opulent palate, with supporting accents of orange zest, toasted brioche and hazelnut that unfold on the medium-length finish. Drink now–2016."
Chardonnay,"This appealing, easy drinker offers notes of vanilla and pear. It's ripe and sweet, fleshy in feel with flavors that lean toward the tropical."
Chardonnay,"This is a balanced, steely white, showing minimal oak and simple layers of apple, pear and vanilla."
Chardonnay,"A steely, mineral wine, concentrated and firm, with vibrant green fruits and very fresh acidity. The structure circles around green apple skins, with tangerine zest and some dry tannins. This is a wine that should be aged—give it 2–3 years. Screwcap."
Chardonnay,"Who knew Ohio made such tasty Chardonnay? Bright and fresh, with scents of green apple, pear, fresh herbs and just a hint of nut oil. This dry, medium-bodied wine offsets juicy flavors of nectarines and apples against a backdrop of sweet cream and white flowers that lingers on the finish. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Plenty of smoky, spicy oak on this Chard, along with ripe, orange, pineapple and apricot flavors. It's a little rough around the edges, though. Drink now."
Chardonnay,Haermosa is made with organically-farmed fruit. It shows milky notes of peach yogurt and white chocolate. But it also shows zesty crispness on the close despite the thickness and fullness of the wine's overall texture.
Chardonnay,"Exciting, fresh and full of spicy, toasted undertones, this wine immediately calls for a food pairing of a richer seafood (think oysters, crab) or poultry. The flavors are balanced and buoyed by crispness, but the wine still offers complexity and a lingering finish."
Chardonnay,"This has flavors of pineapple, orange and buttered toast, with lots of brisk acidity. It offers the oaky creaminess that many Americans love."
Chardonnay,"From a selection of parcels, this is a ripe and fruity wine. Vines aged on average 55 years have produced a ripe concentrated wine with opulent yellow fruits that are balanced by citrus acidity. The wine is ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"Light and crisp, this wine has citrus and green-plum flavors. It is still developing, with plenty of acidity as well a perfumed character. Drink this attractive wine from 2018."
Chardonnay,"This is the winery's small-production, high-end Chardonnay, which shows the brilliant essence of Edna Valley. Few Chardonnays in the state are this streamlined, low in alcohol, crisp and minerally. An accomplishment in this day and age of fat, oaky bottlings, this has a steely taste that is relieved by subtle hints of lime, vanilla and buttered toast. Only 600 cases were produced."
Chardonnay,"A big, strong Chardonnay with prominent buttered toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla, and pineapple-orange jam flavors. Elaborate and flashy, but obviously made to appeal to the modern style. Drink up."
Chardonnay,"Light and vivacious on the nose, this offers lime blossoms, Anjou pear skins and sharp white jasmine flowers. The aromas settle into a salted peach-candy character. Tonic, lime blossoms and lime-zest flavors show on the palate, quite bright and nearly tropical."
Chardonnay,"This phenomenal bottling from the winemaking team of Mike Sinor and Nathan Carlson hits the nose with a judicious touch of vanilla-laced buttercream as well as scorched lemon slices and orange peels. It's playfully lithe on the palate, with just a touch of oak warmth, racy acidity, chalky grip and a faint hint of dill. It's great for now, but will age with nutty style thanks to the balancing tensions."
Chardonnay,"The structure on this wine is just fine, with crisp, coastal acidity and low alcohol making for a clean, well-balanced Chard. Its weakness is in the thinness of flavor. The wine is watery, with mere traces of citrus fruits and peaches."
Chardonnay,"Made in a lighter, more delicate style than many of its brethren, this is nevertheless fresh and flavorful. Pear, melon and white peach notes are framed by hints of toasted brioche, which takes on a slightly mocha-like character on the finish."
Chardonnay,"A solid effort at a bargain price makes this Chardonnay doubly appealing. It's medium bodied, delivering oodles of pineapple-tinged fruit and finishing clean and refreshing."
Chardonnay,"Flamboyantly rich and manipulated Chardonnay, with buttered popcorn, tropical fruit and caramaelized toast flavors. Feels a little heavy-handed, but lots of Chard lovers will like it."
Chardonnay,"Light and fruity, this is an attractive, rounded wine. With its bright acidity, touch of minerality and orange-peel flavor, it is open and ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"Sharp and green, with a minty, chlorophyll taste. High acidity makes the finish searing."
Chardonnay,"From vines planted in the 1960s, and given time in 100% French oak, this dry, unctuous wine is tropical in character. A mix of pineapple and nutmeg teases its way into notes of canned corn."
Chardonnay,"Exuding style and power, this Chardonnay shows complexity with great depth—and breadth—of aromas and flavors. Tropical fruit, citrus, butterscotch, toasted oak and spice are beautifully melded together to achieve a harmonious whole. Near-perfect fruit/acid balance, a supple mouthfeel, and a superlong finish displaying orange and toast notes wrap it up."
Chardonnay,"A clean, brisk Chardonnay made from this small, cool part of Monterey County's Salinas Valley. Shows its region's bright acidity, and also its long hangtime flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples, limes and minerals. Nothing fancy or showy, just a really nice Chard at a fair price."
Chardonnay,"Made in a bone dry, acidic style, what this Chardonnay lacks in richness it makes up for in elegance. Fans of sweet, buttery Chards won't like it, but true aficionados will appreciate the austere citrus and mineral flavors."
Chardonnay,"This wine begins with intense oak and a voluptuous texture before settling into the crisp delicacy of bittersweet lemon and honeyed apple. Full bodied and nicely complex, it's a balanced expression of a cool vineyard site."
Chardonnay,"This Chardonnay has a prominent scent of dusty chalkboard, with background tones of toasted butterscotch, sweat and pear. The flavor intensity is subdued on this light- to medium-bodied wine, with a discreet note of hydrogen peroxide that surfaces late."
Chardonnay,"Aged in 25% new French oak, the rest of it neutral, this age-worthy Chardonnay shows refreshing restraint, though it retains plenty of fruit. The aromas tend toward faint caramel and a complex web of acidity and brightness accompanies notes of apple and pear, a long finish capping things off."
Chardonnay,"Fresh and bright, dominated by its citrus and almond flavors. It has a soft, creamy texture, with highlights of orange zest, green plums and a great burst of acidity."
Chardonnay,Light aromas of apple and pear lead to broad dry flavors. It delivers easy-drinking appeal.
Chardonnay,"It's always a treat to discover a good, well-made but not overpowering wine. This one has nothing in excess, just moderate and crisp fruit flavors with light spicy accents. An appetizing texture backed by good acidity leads to a clean, dry finish. This unoaked wine from northern California should be a crowd pleaser."
Chardonnay,"This is a buttery style of Chardonnay, but done deliciously. Aromas of clotted cream, browned butter, vanilla custard, sea-salt caramel, roasted almonds and cashews meet with fresh lemon and apple-blossom touches on the chalky nose. The palate is very grippy with Meyer lemon and lime pith, but then reveals creamy flavors of clarified butter on toast."
Chardonnay,"A buttery style, this bottling offers popcorn, sea salt caramel and vanilla cookies on the nose alongside tropical coconut, ripe peach and banana fruit, all judiciously presented. There's an immediate sizzle of acidity to cut through the butter on the palate, where pan-fried apples, squeezed lemons and almonds make for an excellent California Chardonnay."
Chardonnay,"Big, and powerful, this has generous flavors of yellow fruit, pear and integrated spice. It has weight to go with its more fruity character. With wood influence, refreshing acidity and a suggestion of tannin, it will age over the next 2–3 years."
Chardonnay,"A wine made in memory of Catherine (Caterina) of Bragança, a Portuguese princess who married Charles II of England in the 17th century. It is a superripe wine, full of tropical fruit flavors and only the lightest of acidity. Wood aging gives the wine a plush character and suggests it could age for another year. Drink from 2016."
Chardonnay,A directly appealing wine with little obvious new oak influence to get in the way of the clean pear and pineapple flavors that are stitched together by just a touch of sweetness.
Chardonnay,"Light aromas of stone fruit, prickly pear and spice lead to a medium-bodied palate that tapers toward the finish."
Chardonnay,"Big, bold and oaky, this wine smells like buttered toast and wood smoke, tastes rich but dry, and brings out pear, marzipan and pineapple flavors. It's full bodied and has a thick mouthfeel and lingering, smoky finish."
Chardonnay,"Freshly buttered toast with a thin coating of marmalade comes to mind when sniffing this wine that also shows a touch of cinnamon and Meyer-lemon juice on the nose. The riper, rounded palate offers yellow apples dipped in caramel, sea salt and cinnamon, which pops again on the back end."
Chardonnay,"Fine acidity and a bracing minerality, like a lick of cold steel on a winter day, mark this Chardonnay. It has oak notes, but they're wisely kept in the background, allowing the citrus, green apple and peach flavors to star. This beautiful wine continues the winery's string of great reserve Chardonnays, and is their best since the 2006 vintage."
Chardonnay,"An interesting Chard that offers quite sweet notes of stewed peaches, orange marmalade and overripe honeydew. Big and a bit clumsy in the mouth, more vibrancy and freshness is needed to keep things in better balance. However, if you like 'em sweeter, this one's for you."
Chardonnay,"This brings a boatload of flavor for the price. It's packed with fruit;  citrus, pineapple, apple, and peach, round and succulent, with just the right amount of sharp acidity to give it some verve."
Chardonnay,"This wine is full bodied and rich on the palate, with a woody reminder of oak. Spicy apple notes are lifted by spritzy acidity."
Chardonnay,"Somewhat closed and tight at first, this eventually opens up to reveal scents of firm stone fruit, fynbos, Asian pear, orange blossom and white melon rind. There's a roundness to the palate, supported by dense flavors of melon flesh and roasted nuts. Enjoy now."
Chardonnay,"This Chardonnay has all the bells and whistles the winemaker can bestow on it. It's soft and creamy, with flavors of sweetly-sour pineapple and lemon-drop candy, buttered toast and savory cinnamon spices. Fine acidity gives a sheen to the richness."
Chardonnay,"Pineapple and apple aromas are fairly attractive and fresh, as is the light, wet and zippy palate, which shows mostly citrus and apple flavors. The finish is mild and clean, and overall the wine delivers clarity and a dominant citrus profile."
Chardonnay,"Not a good result from MontGras. This is a pulpy, sweet, flat-lining Chardonnay that may not even make it as far as your table. So soft it barely registers."
Chardonnay,"On the ripe, tropical side of Pouilly, this is a full wine, laden with attractive notes of wood, juicy yellow fruit and bitter orange zest. It is warm, rich and ready to drink later this year."
Chardonnay,"Tart with acidity but lush with fruit, this is a lovely Chardonnay to drink with shellfish dishes. Honeyed notes accompany flavors of tropical fruit, Meyer lemon and lime. Oak lends touches of vanilla and a creaminess that finishes clean."
Chardonnay,"A flamboyant Chard, packed with tropical fruit flavors and with a lavish overlay of smoky oak. Drinks crisp and clean in the mouth, with a creamy texture and a long, spicy finish. Could use a bit more finesse and subtlety, but glamorous and enticing."
Chardonnay,"This wine is a bit reductive out of the gate, opening to reveal aromas of pear, peach, melon, lees and spice. The palate is creamy and textured in feel. If the aromas come together, it could move up a notch."
Chardonnay,"From granite soil, this rounded wine has a firm core of structure. Pineapple and peach fruit flavors surround this center, making it full in the mouth, rich and charming. Acidity at the end and the firm texture promise some aging. Drink from 2015."
Chardonnay,"A ripe, open style of wine, giving white fruits, even some peach flavors, with toast and sweetness. There is weight, and a dense texture as well, the acidity lifting the finish."
Chardonnay,"Dusty apple and papaya aromas lack fortitude. Ditto the palate, which barely stays afloat. Briny citrus flavors and a pickled finish do nothing to elevate this bottom-feeding Chardonnay."
Chardonnay,"Winemaker: Andries Burger. Aromas of honeyed apple, Bartlett pear, buttered toast and popcorn all waft aggressively from the glass. The palate is similarly intense, with a full body and lush flavors of ripe peach, honeydew and sweet spice that carry through to the long finish. The midpalate is a bit flat, but ample acidity keeps the finish shining bright. Drink now–2020."
Chardonnay,"With a large dose of Russian River Valley grapes, this delirious and delicious white is dark gold in color, medium to almost full bodied, with a richness overridden by bright floral notes of apple blossom and pear. It finishes in a flurry of oak and vanilla, and was aged in new and used French and American oak."
Chardonnay,"Spicy and salty, it's a bit like an Albariño, with little to indicate its Chardonnay varietal character. Though technically correct, it's just rather plain; in a blind tasting it could pass for almost any simple white wine."
Chardonnay,"This wine is full bodied and rich on the palate, with a woody reminder of oak. Spicy apple notes are lifted by spritzy acidity."
Chardonnay,"The wine is light but it also has very fine fruitiness and great balanced acidity. With a creamy texture and touches of yellow fruit as well as citrus, the wine is refreshingly fruity with great final acidity in a ripe rounded context. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"A creamy texture and apple pie flavors make this so rich it's almost a dessert. It is not actually sweet but has a full body and lush viscosity, presumably from barrel fermentation. It shows the shaping influence that barrels can have on heft and mouthfeel without adding heavy oak flavors per se. Delicious!"
Chardonnay,"An almost overpowering fragrance greets the nose on this bottling, with scents of lime and pear blossoms, honeysuckle, jasmine and peach sorbet. The palate is very citrus-driven, with oranges and tangerine skin, proving quite sour and tart for such a ripe introduction."
Chardonnay,"Bright gold in color, this is fragrant of sweet spice, smoke and orange rind. Medium-bodied in style, the palate is a tad tart, with notes of sour apple, lemon and underripe tangerine. Finishes on a sour wood note."
Chardonnay,"Made from old vines, this ripe and concentrated wine is smooth and creamy. Good acidity balances the rich fruits, giving flavors of apples, pears and apricots cut by a line of citrus. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017."
Chardonnay,"A wonderfully concentrated nose of hazelnut and fresh apple draws you in. The palate comes in with bundled freshness of lemon and bright precision. This is taut now, but will open up in good time. Lovers of unusual interpretations of Chardonnay are in for a treat. The lemony purity just lasts and lasts. Drink 2028–2025."
Chardonnay,"This simple Chardonnay is tropical fruit driven, with a floral aroma and a twang of resiny oak. The palate seems slightly disjointed in feel, briny in flavor and citric on the finish."
Chardonnay,"New winemaking and a sizable replanting effort at the producer's Spring Mountain estate are starting to show dividends in this new release, a full-bodied style true to its heritage. Bright acidity pops around a taste of pomelo and yuzu, giving the wine a zest of lemon before a caramelized finish."
Chardonnay,"This Chardonnay's acidity and minerally structure are finely balanced, and its palate already shows richness. Full, fruity and textured, the wine's touch of toast creeps into notice. This is worth aging for 2–3 years."
Chardonnay,"Dark honey gold in color, this is reminiscent of cider. It's an interesting use of ripe Chardonnay, but finishes overly sour, almost bitter."
Chardonnay,This wine offers an aged quality to its accompanying freshness. A taste of honey and dried apple surround soft layers of citrus and a toasted oak finish.
Chardonnay,"This is a lovely and well-balanced display of unoaked Chardonnay, with all of the flowery frills yet none of the treacly, overly tropical touches. Light in the glass, it shows guava, jasmine water and a lime-skin tartness. The palate is amazingly fresh, with guava, papaya, peach and ripe pear flavors that persist deep into the finish."
Chardonnay,"This wine has a deep-gold color, attractive baking-spice and buttered popcorn aromas, appealing apple and pear flavors and medium body. The texture is soft and easy and the acidity tastes low."
Chardonnay,"Hard to say just why this Chard isn't better. It's nicely dry, with decent acidity, good oak and a mineral background to the citrus and peach flavors. There's just a heaviness that keeps the wine from getting airborne."
Chardonnay,"Stony minerality surrounds sublime texture in this full-bodied, balanced expression of the appellation's Middle Reach neighborhood, an area known for producing wines of great beauty and subtle power. Apple, pear and richer characteristics of stone fruit are succulent on the palate, while a racy spiciness intrigues."
Chardonnay,"Clean, simple pear, melon and apple aromas are friendly. Reasonably full and fresh on the palate, this value-priced wine tastes of tropical fruits including banana and papaya as well as honey. A slightly oily finish gives weight to closing citrus flavors."
Chardonnay,"A fragrant apple-skin aroma sets the scene for this wine that is warm and ripe. A touch of nutmeg adds an extra dimension to its yellow fruits. It's rich while still remaining true to its minerally, terroir-based origins. Age for two years."
Chardonnay,"Perfumed spice aromas give this wine its toasty character. The wood aging dominates the fruit. The fruit, though, is ripe and will develop. Give this wine until 2024."
Chardonnay,"Creamy and lush, with pure peach and pear aromas along with nice vanilla accents. The palate is fairly rich and layered, but it's also properly acidic and, therefore, well balanced. The flavors of pear and butter seem on the money, and the finish is solid and of moderate length. All in all, this is a very good Chardonnay with no overt faults."
Chardonnay,"This is a powerhouse of a wine—structured and dense yet still developing and closed at this young stage. There's already a sense of both fruit richness and mineral texture, underpinned by oak spice, yet it will grow more powerful with time. Drink from 2023."
Chardonnay,"There are masses of pineapple, apricot, orange and green apple fruit in this Chardonnay, accented with strong Carneros acidity. Quite a good wine, but once you get past the flavors, it falls off in interest. Could be a rare Chardonnay sleeper. Try giving it 2–3 years in the cellar."
Chardonnay,"This delicious Chardonnay offers creamy opulence and rich notes of vanilla, honey and peach. It has dense, slightly sweet, fruit flavors lavished over good structure and ends with spicy crispness. Pair it with white meat or pasta salad."
Chardonnay,"A warm, earthy, rustic style, richly fruity with peaches and sweet juiced fruits. There is good balance of wood, toast, nutmeg and sweet spice. The finale draws a fine line in elegance."
Chardonnay,"Barrel fermented and put through full malolactic with regular batonnage, this superbly balanced, graceful Chardonnay is orchestrated around a complex mix of pear, tropical fruit, biscuit, cream soda and light baking spices. The acidity carries a hint of mineral, and the palate impression is lively and smooth."
Chardonnay,"Focused in the mouth with just a touch of creaminess, the Logan offers pear and nutmeg flavors, and a hint of green apple on the finish. It's not a mouthfilling, overly flashy wine, but this could be a good thing if you're pouring it with dinner. Try it with your first-course seafood dish."
Chardonnay,"Apple aromas come with a mild but noticeable burn. This feels dense and thick, with creaminess to the palate. Flavors of pear, melon and banana slow down and thicken up on the finish, which is round and not at all complex."
Chardonnay,"Brown sugar and buttered toast flavors dominate this wine, but it's not cloying, because it has lots of acidity. The mango, tangerine and peach flavors testify to exceptional ripeness."
Chardonnay,"This is beautifully rich and powerful, with tropical fruit flavors and a hint of wood. It has enormous concentration of sweet, ripe white and yellow fruits, balanced by the sharp cut of acidity."
Chardonnay,"From vineyards on the cooler south bank of the Serein, this wine is crisp and tightly coiled despite the warmth of the 2015 vintage. It's built on a backbone of sturdy minerality, fleshed out with crisp, citrus fruit, and will be ready to drink from late 2017."
Chardonnay,"Ripe, creamy wine with a good toast element. It is smooth, elegant, the flavors showing almonds, vanilla, baked apple and pear enlivened by fresh acidity. Attractive, ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"Walnut and almond aromas share the bouquet with melon and apple scents. This feels fleshy and resiny, with a generic mix of white-fruit flavors and oak. A bulky, woody, creamy finish with tropical fruit flavors is kept afloat by firm acidity."
Chardonnay,"Made entirely from Chardonnay, this opens with yellow apple, Williams pear and white peach aromas that follow through to the palate. It's elegant and steeped in vanilla and hazelnut flavors, with fresh acidity that lifts its creamy texture."
Chardonnay,"From blocks of old Wente vines planted in the 1970s, this producer and site continue to find beautiful synergy together. This wine shows high-toned floral notes around full-bodied richness and flavors of crème brûlée and anise. A salty accent begs for attention as a kick of citrus finishes with grace and freshness."
Chardonnay,"This wine shows exceptional freshness on the nose with newly mown grass, hay and lemon fruit. Yarraman is Aboriginal for “wild horse” and the palate has an appropriate kick to it, with crisp acidity suppporting complex lanolin, citrus and pineapple flavors. The finish is surprisingly long. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Hailing from Conner Lee Vineyard, this barrel-fermented wine was aged in two-thirds new French oak. It has aromas of toast, char, nut oil and lemon. The flavors seem faint by comparison, with the concentration not all there."
Chardonnay,"This conveys a heady mix of luscious French oak, butter and toast, plus roasted nuts, a dash of Cognac, orange oil, apple sauce and baked pear. This thrilling wine is the first Chardonnay from Trisaetum. It reflects the growing partnership between winemaker James Frey and Jacques Lardière formerly from Jadot."
Chardonnay,"This is a rare venture by Olivier Leflaive outside his home territory around Puligny, Chassagne and Meursault. The wine is classic Corton-Charlemagne, big and bold, a broad-shouldered wine that brings together toastiness, ripe pineapple and mango and balancing, lively acidity. It is already giving great pleasure, but should last well over the next decade."
Chardonnay,"This wine offers impressive quality for the price, combining hints of toasted hazelnuts with white peaches and pineapple. It's medium-bodied and crisp, with refreshing, citrusy acids on the finish. Drink now–2020."
Chardonnay,"Well made in large quantity, this wine offers fleshy tropical papaya around a structure of toasty oak and vanilla. Medium in body and length, it's balanced with a crisp finish."
Chardonnay,"A more than solid wine cut from the tropical, South American blueprint. It's open and full of banana, pear and apple aromas, and while it runs hot and fast on the palate, it's got lots of woody, ripe flavors of apple and pithy citrus. Round, lively and packed with flavor even if it shows almost nothing in common with cool-climate Chardonnay."
Chardonnay,"Intriguing notes of honey, poached pear, apple with drizzled caramel and a light touch of marzipan show on the nose on this bottling that leans somewhat sweet in aromas. But the sip is dry, with Asian pear, jasmine and honeysuckle elements, quite crisp and engaging for the palate on multiple levels."
Chardonnay,"This gorgeous wine is floral and doughy, made entirely from Chardonnay and given time to mellow and mature over many years. The patience is rewarded in intensely complex layers of apple, pear and lemon—a caramelized backdrop providing appropriate richness and accents of gingerbread and doughy brioche."
Chardonnay,"A sweet, simple Chardonnay, with pineapple and orange jam flavors and oak-like vanilla and caramel influences."
Chardonnay,"The winery mentions neutral oak barrels, though the immediate aromatic impression is still on the toasty/oaky side. The fruit comes up more slowly, along with residual CO2 that gives a spritzy mouthfeel. Yeasty, light and tart, with green apples the strongest fruit flavor."
Chardonnay,"Soft and buttery, this medium-bodied Chardonnay smells like lemon meringue and tastes lightly sweet like marshmallows and bananas."
Chardonnay,"Following an unfortunate Chanson white wine style, this wine is totally dominated by new, high toast wood. It shows freshness, but the acidity comes from the wood, leaving the structured fruit way behind."
Chardonnay,"While the initial impression is fruity, the wine then shows almond and spice characters. The texture, is thin and light, like apple juice with taut acidity."
Chardonnay,"A brilliant Chardonnay. It's powerful and ripe in fruit, offering a blast of pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie and Meyer lemon tart flavors, accented with the buttered toast of oak. As intense as the fruit is, it's balanced by keen acidity and a stony minerality. Defines the elegant, opulent Russian River style."
Chardonnay,"A personal wine project of winemaker Ric Forman and his wife, Cheryl Emmolo, this gorgeously rendered, elegant, minerality-driven white offers subtle waves of apple skin, lemon and tangerine. Bright from start to finish, it's well worth seeking out."
Chardonnay,"Fresh, superripe as well as candied pineapple combine to give utter opulence to this rich and viscous wine. The longer you taste, the more intense—almost heady—these tropical flavors become. What is more, as an ice wine untainted by any botrytis, this shines with purity and drive, and has astonishing acidity that keeps this just on the right side of paradise."
Chardonnay,"This wine is sourced from a handful of stellar vineyards, including Pratt, Dutton, Sullivan and Chenoweth. It was given 18 months in French oak, all of it twice-used or older, which contributes to an integrated, understated wood presence that's refreshing in its restraint. Creamy acidity and a taste of baked bread cradles lemon zest and almond before a crisp, lengthy finish."
Chardonnay,"Caramelized oak and honey give this estate wine an undeniable richness offset by a streak of rocky minerality. Smooth in texture, it's plush, lush and robustly full bodied, accented by green apple and melon. It celebrates a warm site, warm vintage and meticulous winemaking."
Chardonnay,"Like so many producers and négociants, Bouchard Père has a slice of the action in this famed Grand Cru. Its interpretation is generous, going for the inherent richness from the terroir. This is a magnificently ripe wine, definitely opulent, with the generous wood enhancing the very ripe fruit. In all this splendor, it is good to find a delicious edge of acidity."
Chardonnay,"With a clarity of fruit and minerality, this wine is brightly floral and noticeably stony, with highlights of melon, lemon and green apple."
Chardonnay,"Yellow in color, blowsy on the nose, and chunky to the max in the mouth. This wine is big, forced and heavy, with orange, banana and melon flavors. Finishes soft and with no discernible oak or elegance."
Chardonnay,"This ripe, full-bodied wine is made from biodynamically grown grapes. Although rich, it has enough acidity to keeps it crisp and fruity. The wine is balanced and delicious, ready to drink now."
Chardonnay,"Basic apple and citrus aromas are dusty and straightforward. This feels citrusy and fresh, with little to no oak. Flavors of nectarine, white grapefruit and orange finish firm and fresh."
Chardonnay,"A delicious Chardonnay made in the California style of ripeness. It's fortunately balanced with acidity, which balances the sweet pineapple and honey flavors, but needs to be a bit drier."
Chardonnay,"From the Mâcon appellation that is dominated by the formidable rock of Solutré, this is a ripe, full-bodied wine. It offers juicy acidity, fresh sliced apple flavors and a touch of spice. The wine is ready, although it will be better from late 2016."
Chardonnay,"Smooth and generous, this wine is soft and missing any bite. It is round and unfocused, but ready to drink now."
Chardonnay,"This Chardonnay is rich and decadent with plenty of ripe fruit and oak. It's a crowd pleaser with flavors of mangoes, pineapples, limes, buttered toast and vanilla, all brightened by acidity."
Chardonnay,"Made in the popular style, this Chardonnay shows simple oak, pineapple, mango and peach flavors. It finishes with notes of vanilla and honey."
Chardonnay,"For those who love a big, oaky Chardonnay, this is for you. It's raw, blocky and rough, but there is plenty of fresh oak flavor, and time should integrate the wood into the clean and straightforward green apple flavor."
Chardonnay,"This négociant-style wine offers immediate appeal. Aromas of lemon, candle wax, mineral, lees and toast are followed by lively, sleek citrus flavors. This was a banner vintage for Washington whites and this wine is batting cleanup."
Chardonnay,Hints of salted caramel accent flavors of apple and pear concentrate in this bold-bodied Chardonnay. Yielding acidity accentuates its ripe weighty mouthfeel. The finish is brisk.
Chardonnay,"Rich and creamy, with fruit-forward flavors of pineapple jam, oranges, ripe peaches, vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity gives balance and clean liveliness."
Chardonnay,"The debut vintage for this cuvée, this is made from 100% Wente clone vines planted in 1977. It's richly concented on the palate, layered with dried apricot, grapefruit and pineapple flavors. A lush, buttery note enwraps its long, satisfying, full-bodied finish."
Chardonnay,"This standard Chardonnay opens with blowsy melon and papaya aromas. The palate holds onto that melony feel while dealing honeydew, papaya and fleshy apple flavors. The finish tastes sweet and kind of flat."
Chardonnay,"Light apple aromas lead to a sweet, mildly candied palate of monotone apple flavors. Acidity is up there, so there isn't any overt thickness or chunkiness to the wine. Rudimentary and quaffable."
Chardonnay,"Simple and sweet, with jammy pineapple, orange and apricot flavors leading to a soft, honeyed finish."
Chardonnay,"This is a soft, flavorful wine full of creamy yellow fruit. Hints of wood aging and a delicate mineral texture add depth to the palate, but this wine will age quickly, so drink now–2020."
Chardonnay,"Citrus and orange zest flavors and bright acids characterize this wine. It's a refreshing selection, and it has a tight texture and pear juice flavor. Age it for 1–2 years."
Chardonnay,"Oaky and bone dry, with ripe pineapple, green apple and buttered toast flavors, brightened by zesty, mouthwatering acidity. Ready now, but don't chill too much to enjoy the nuances."
Chardonnay,"Sophisticated aromas of Golden Pearmain apples, cream and pastry take the part of the first violin—chalky, resonant earth that of the sonorous cello. Their harmony and elegance together is astonishing. The crisp acidity is so well-integrated and illuminates the fruit and soil. The long finish again emphasizes absolute, uncompromising elegance of this wine."
Chardonnay,"Light on the nose, this shows delicate aromas of Asian pear, honeysuckle, squeezed lemon wedge, fresh coconut flesh and a tiny bit of butter. The palate is also demure yet delicious, with lightly poached apples, squeezed lime and a chalky textural grip."
Chardonnay,"The wine is quite tight in character, but shows some richer potential. It is generous, full-bodied and packed with apricot and apple skin flavors. Give it until 2015."
Chardonnay,"Made in the modern style of oaky creaminess and very flashy fruit, this Chardonnay erupts in a burst of oranges and rum punch, buttered toast and honey. It's rich and layered, if a little soft."
Chardonnay,"The aromas are almost completely shut down, with light notes of corn on the cob and peach. The flavors are lightly concentrated, making it a strain to hear what they have to say."
Chardonnay,"This ripe, spicy wine offers apple, pear and apricot flavors, giving ripeness and warm juicy acidity. The wine is smooth and rounded, with a crisp aftertaste. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"One of the closest things there is to a can't-miss wine, Leeuwin's Chardonnay is always on form. The 2011 Art Series is flamboyantly oaked, with smoky, toasty, nutty notes layered over hints of white peach and grilled pineapple. It's less rich than some vintages have been, but still appealingly mealy in texture. Drink now–2020."
Chardonnay,"This normally rich Meursault has gone into overdrive in 2009, producing a superopulent wine. It does, however, balance that with fine acidity and a mineral edge. It opens slowly to give its apple and peach fruits."
Chardonnay,"This marches in a completely opposite direction from the oaky, fruity, buttery style of modern Chardonnay. It's bone dry and minerally, with mouthwatering acidity and traces of oranges and limes. The minerality is like a lick of cold steel. What a great food wine at a great price, although production was a paltry 230 cases."
Chardonnay,"In 2012, my favorite of the Kumeu River Chardonnays is the medium- to full-bodied, creamy-textured offering from Hunting Hill. Think streusel-topped citrus, but dry, with a long, harmonious finish."
Chardonnay,"Towards the southern end of Chassagne, Morgeot is a large premier cru that once belonged to an abbey. This wine is full of fruit, spiced with the wood aging and with a strongly mineral texture. It has the potential to be rich, round and smooth. Wait until 2018."
Chardonnay,Full barrel fermentation in French oak yields a delicious Chardonnay with fruit tasting of grapefruit and peaches. The buttery mouthfeel and streak of vanilla cookie match up well with the expected acidity from Okanagan grapes.
Chardonnay,"Packs more flavor than any other two wines put together. This fruit bomb explodes on the palate with limes, tangerines,  peaches and the sweetest green apples and papayas, and it's all creamy and spicy. It feels dryish until you swallow, when a peacock's tail of sugar fans out on the way down. —S.H."
Chardonnay,"Marked by strong acidity and minerality, this is an austere Chardonnay for drinking now. With a citrus flavor and a dry, honeyed richness, this sits on the elegant side of the Chardonnay spectrum."
Chardonnay,"Textured vanilla-cream and green apple appear initially in this wine, which offers plenty of weight and structure around a core of balanced acidity and fresh lemon zest. Cardamom and vanilla play at the edges alongside elements of savory brine and white flowers. The oak presence is subtle."
Chardonnay,"A gold color and flat nose are indicators that this doesn't have a lot of life to it. Creamy, baked, sweet aromas lead to a round, mellow palate with applesauce and creamy, lactic flavors. A sugary finish is low on acidic cut and is slightly cloying."
Chardonnay,"The most serious of the Chablis Grand Crus has produced here a wine that combines that firmer nature with generous yellow fruits, toast and tender acidity. A strong sense of structure partners with a steely core and mineral texture that firms up the fruit and promises aging. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,"Another deliciously drinkable Chardonnay from this fine estate. Shows the ripe tropical fruit and peach flavors the vineyard is famous for. Oak brings extra richness of buttered toast, but the whole is balanced with crisp acidity. Drink up."
Chardonnay,"Very dry and quite acidic, this racy Chardonnay has a Chablis-like minerality that suggests chalk and steel. That may come from the grapes that were grown in the far southerly part of the valley. An equal percentage hails from warmer St. Helena, and they seem to have contributed the pears and peaches."
Chardonnay,"A little burnt and rubbery on the nose, but with enough lemon and apple to balance things out. The palate is fleshy and soft, with banana and lemon as the lead flavors. Shows a bit of pithy bitterness late, but overall it's good if you like sweet, warm Chardonnays."
Chardonnay,"This Chard did not go through malolactic fermentation, allowing the acidity to stand up to what otherwise would be an overripe wine. It's strong in tropical fruits, peaches, brown sugar, vanilla bean and buttered toast flavors that are soft, direct and one-dimensional."
Chardonnay,"Another fine Chardonnay from this producer. It's typical of the vineyard, showing intensely concentrated tropical and citrus fruit and green apple flavors, enhanced with mouthwatering acidity. Vertical tastings of this bottling show its ability to slowly evolve in the bottle over as much as eight years."
Chardonnay,"An absolutely first-class Chardonnay, although with production at only 100 cases, it may be somewhat difficult to find. It shows near-perfect balance of acidity, oak, minerality and lees, with a touch of sour-lemon candy drop."
Chardonnay,"Tastes manipulated, with oak, honey and buttercream flavors dominating the underlying apples and peaches."
Chardonnay,"Reserved aromas of lemon zest, shaved butter and wet stone greet the nose on this ready-to-drink bottling from West Paso. The palate shows poached apple and cooked pear tones, with a slightly sour tang keeping it lively."
Chardonnay,"This is a beautiful wine, full of ripe yellow fruits, steely acidity and a juicy character that comes from the apple and apricot fruit flavors. While there is a firm layer of toast from the wood aging, the wine is rich, tight and full of acidity. This structured wine needs many years, so drink from 2020."
Chardonnay,"The wine is ripe and firm with great concentration. It comes from old vines in this southeast-facing vineyard. Rich and full of white stone fruits that are cut with citrus, it is a wine to age. The aftertaste has spice and strong minerality. Drink this wine from 2019."
Chardonnay,"From a selection of vineyard-designated sites, including Durell, Campbell Ranch and several Sangiacomo sites, this well-crafted blend is buzzing in minerality, a wet-stone character that overlays a depth of silky richness. Approachable now and yet structured for aging, its medium-level weight is awash in ripe apple and pear, finishing lean."
Chardonnay,"This marquee estate site supplies yet another gorgeous vintage of this powerful white, which opens with a crisp aroma of orange blossom. It follows in to the full-bodied palate, alongside layers of pear, pineapple and melon, all kept fresh by juicy acidity amid bites of oak and baking spice."
Chardonnay,"Bone dry and tart in citrusy acidity, this is a Chablis-style Chardonnay. It has a firm minerality grounding clean flavors of sour pineapple candy, with richer notes of vanilla and smoky oak. Elegant and food-friendly."
Chardonnay,"Soft, sugary-sweet and simple, like a fruit juice made from apricots, peaches and pineapples."
Chardonnay,"Lots to like in this dry, fruity Chardonnay. It has flavors of tropical fruits, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into a rich, creamy mouthfeel. But it's pretty acidic, if you're sensitive to prickliness in your wines."
Chardonnay,"Light and frothy in the glass, this beautifully perfumed dry sparkling is redolent of orange blossoms, apples and pears. A blend of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay, there's a delicious hint of buttery cashew nut and bitter almond amidst the floral, fresh apple and lemon flavors."
Chardonnay,"Given time to ferment and age in a majority of neutral oak, this wine still offers thickness and viscosity. It's rich and lush in tropical pineapple, mango and sliced peach, buoyed by acidity and a focused approach."
Chardonnay,"Floral and aromatic, this is a ripe wine with delicious, intense acidity as well as a touch of honey. Rich peach and pear come through strongly. It's a refreshing, juicy wine that is developing quickly. Drink from 2016."
Chardonnay,"Toasty oak kicks off the nose of this bottling, and then come touches of vanilla, lemon cookie, flint, buttered toast and almost marshmallow. Flavors are quite smoky, with roasted almond and sea salt, but the grippy texture is the most intriguing part."
Chardonnay,"Honey, butter, yellow pear, pineapple and vanilla cream show on the supple and soft palate of this bottling—one of the new appellation blends branded under the Nielson name. Sea salt and caramel apple show on the palate, which is underlied and bound by a rain-on-slate minerality, and finishes on an apple custard note."
Chardonnay,"Light in body, with pineapple and mint aromas and tart, citrusy and green flavors. Metallic on the finish."
Chardonnay,"This medium-weight Chard is fresh and mildly dusty smelling, with aromas of pear and apple. The palate is lifted, fresh in feel and offers punchy acidity in front of lime, gooseberry and herb flavors. For under $20, this is nicely made and hints at elegance."
Chardonnay,"Tastes like it's getting old, showing tired orange and apricot flavors that are dry and acidic."
Chardonnay,"A fine, useful Chardonnay, made in the modern ripe style. Bursts with juicy pineapple, Key lime pie, Meyer lemon, buttered toast and vanilla flavors, accented with crisp coastal acidity."
Chardonnay,"There is a fine mineral-driven backbone to this ripe, concentrated and fruity wine, which gives its dense apricot and pineapple flavors great structure. It needs to age for at least four years."
Chardonnay,"Made entirely from one vineyard source and one variety, this was barrel-fermented in half new French oak. Nonetheless it is marked most by its lightness and crisp, clean flavor of lemon, apple and passionfruit, the oak providing structure in the background only."
Chardonnay,"A rare disappointment from Saint Clair—and it's still a good wine, just not up the standards set by the winery's other reserve wines. Ripe, peachy fruit is not so much framed by oak as covered by it, starting and finishing with layers of buttered toast and vanilla."
Chardonnay,"This wine is tight, textured and still young. With crisp, mineral acidity and bright citrus and white stone fruits, it needs to age to show its full, rich potential. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,"The to-the-point bouquet includes lightly toasted apple aromas and white-fruit scents. A chiseled, tight palate with crisp acidity supports stone-fruit and citrus flavors. Dry, crisp orange and tangerine flavors characterize the finish."
Chardonnay,Simple peach and melon aromas shine in this unoaked Chardonnay. A light-bodied palate holds apple and stone-fruit flavors before fading in to the short yet clean finish.
Chardonnay,"Made in the rich, buttery style, this decadent Chardonnay oozes honey, butterscotch, tropical fruit, vanilla and toast flavors. It also has a much-needed minerality that adds depth and firmness. The grapes come from Carneros, Oakville and St. Helena. Drink through 2016."
Chardonnay,"This earthy Chardonnay from a limestone plot has more to do with texture and tight acidity than fruit. It presents a sharp, too-crisp edge."
Chardonnay,"This is a nutty, toasty rendering of Chardonnay. Roasted cashew and cashew-butter notes frame subtle fruit elements reminiscent of white peach or pear. Despite a modest alcohol level, it's reasonably rich in feel and flavor, finishing with flavors of fresh pineapple."
Chardonnay,"Warm touches of lemon-laced chamomile tea, soft butter and a dollop of orange sherbert show on the nose of this intriguing and unique wine from the Sierra Madre Vineyard. There's a strong sense of baking soda-like alkalinity to the palate, laced through juicy lemon and tangerine flavors, pithy grip, slate minerality and a mouth-watering combo of acidity and salt."
Chardonnay,"Divio, notes winemaker Bruno Corneaux, is the ancient Roman name for Dijon, hence, a sly reference to the clones in this outstanding Chardonnay. It's lush and flavorful, with a juicy mix of pear, peach and papaya fruit. Aged 15 months in 50% new French oak, the fruit sets up against a palate-popping wash of toasted hazelnuts, filling out the extended finish. An all-around splendid bottle."
Chardonnay,"Oak dominates this wine, with buttered toast and caramel flavors overwhelming the underlying orange, lemon and peach flavors."
Chardonnay,"This creamy sparkler has a floral fragrance of white flower and pear. The palate delivers tropical fruit, citrus, bitter almond and sage notes. This is a classic apéritif and perfect for making toasts."
Chardonnay,"Very mineral in style, this is a structured, textured wine with good aging potential. It's acidity, still pronounced and up front, reveals itself with crisp citrus flavors that accent warm yellow fruits. The wine needs a year or two before drinking, so wait until 2015."
Chardonnay,"Intoxicating in vanilla and peach, the aromas telegraphing honeysuckle and anise, this balanced, dry vintage Brut from 100% Chardonnay grapes is soft, food-friendly and easy to drink."
Chardonnay,"A block selection off the estate vineyard. Shows a lovely, firm minerality and leesy note, with rich citron, Asian pear, pineapple, baked apple, peach pie and spice flavors. An elaborate wine, amazingly rich and layered, yet so light and silky in the mouth."
Chardonnay,"This Chardonnay-based Satèn sparkling wine opens with creamy aromas of vanilla, lemon custard, apricot and dried sage. The wine has a smooth, rich and persistent character thanks to the delicate quality of its perlage."
Chardonnay,"The fruitiness in this tight wine is still developing, hiding for now behind a bitter, toasty character. That should soften as the wine fills out—from 2018."
Chardonnay,"Here's a wine with a limited repertoire, but the one tune it's beating is a good one: pineapple on the nose, pineapple in the mouth and pineapple on the short finish. Intensity and length are in short supply but this is a fine, refreshing choice for unthinking summer sipping. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Up there in the Chalone hills they have a lot of limestone, and you can taste the flint and chalk in this wine even through the lavish tropical fruit and spice. It's a really interesting Chardonnay that's quite fancy and elegantly structured, and it will hold for a good six years."
Chardonnay,"This Chardonnay hits all the right marks, as toasty oak influence is coupled seamlessly with ripe fruit tones and balancing acidity. Gorgeous scents of yellow apple, melon and honeysuckle transition through to the medium-weight palate, where they are met by attractive oak spice tones, a subtle tannic texture and refreshing acidic lift. The finish is long and evolving, and this should drink well through 2020."
Chardonnay,"An easy, flashy Chardonnay to drink now. Shows tropical fruit, green apple, honey and sweet oak flavors, with a savory edge of acidity."
Chardonnay,"A real fruit bomb, with explosive flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes and peaches, accented with sweet smoky oak. Malolactic fermentation adds softer flavors of buttered popcorn."
Chardonnay,"Intense and high in acidity, this wine skirts the edge of ripeness in its salty, briny take on the variety, a nod to an historic clone. Floral, it persists in apple blossom and tart Meyer lemon, finishing crisp and fresh."
Chardonnay,"A good Chardonnay that offers plenty of tropical fruit, pear and sweet, smoky oak flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. But Ridge hasn't been known as a source of great Chardonnay for years, and this '08 doesn't change that. It's seriously overpriced."
Chardonnay,"Unabashedly buttery and oaky in aroma and flavor, this first-class, full-bodied wine has a mouth-filling, creamy texture that lingers long into the finish. It starts with buttered toast and almond aromas and opens into a rich pear-and-hazelnut palate, its flavors unfolding in nuanced layers."
Chardonnay,"The merest hint of ripe stone fruit presents itself on the nose. The palate has the same clean stone-fruited charm, reminiscent of freshly harvested yellow plums. The unoaked palate is balanced and has a pleasant, plump weight, leavened by natural freshness and verve. A lighter style of Chardonnay with great charm and lingering freshness."
Chardonnay,"This wine takes time to unravel and reveal itself, rewarding the patient with a wealth of high-toned citrus and elegantly wound, medium-bodied honeyed pear and caramel. Lengthy and complex, it's one to consider aging and allowing to further mellow over time. Drink now through 2021."
Chardonnay,"This is an excellent Riserva metodo classico sparkling wine from northern Italy with a full, creamy consistency. Made with 100% Chardonnay, the wine boasts deep layers of stone fruit, yeast, honey and almond nut."
Chardonnay,"Balanced, delicious wine, bringing in very fresh fruit, ripe apple flavors, a mineral streak of acidity and finely textured wood. Could keep for another 1–2 years."
Chardonnay,"This rich wine is full and has a good balance of acidity and fruit. The lightly mineral texture gives bite and crispness. It is still a young, tight wine needing another few months. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,"This is very structured and full, with a powerful minerality, citrus and spice flavors, and a tight, nervy character. It has the weight to age for 3–4 years."
Chardonnay,"Made entirely with Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of toast and whiffs of banana and mango. The aromas carry on to the palate along with a creamy hint of butter."
Chardonnay,"This wine is crisp, with a mineral texture that is tight and allows for considerable citric acidity. A riper background conveys rich apple flavors and a taut, nervy, steely character. Drink this concentrated wine from 2017."
Chardonnay,"This Chard has lots going for it, crisp acidity balanced with intense flavors of tropical fruits, orange, buttercream and baking spices. It's easy to drink now with classic California fare like Dungeness crab and buttered sourdough bread."
Chardonnay,"It's been a while since Torres Chile has made a Chardonnay this good. Minerally and toasty is the best way to describe this structured white. Good acidity keeps it upright, while plenty of barrel, cinnamon, apple and lemon character give it a Burgundian leaning. This is woody, racy and very lively now. Drink in 2014–15."
Chardonnay,"Lime, sea shell, rainy cement and orange-rind aromas make for a brisk entry to the nose of this bottling, rounded out by a touch of pineapple. The palate is framed by a chalky grip, and shows flavors of tangy lemon and slightly sour apple."
Chardonnay,"This shows a hint of mineral along with tropical fruit. This is a seductive combination that shows richness and a taut, nervy character. Age for at least six years."
Chardonnay,"On the lean, citrusy side, but the flavors of pineapple and lemon are married to hints of vanilla and smoke for added complexity. Could use a touch more flesh, but some will enjoy the crispness."
Chardonnay,"Light but inviting wood aromas from oak to acacia show on the nose of this bottling, along with red-pear skins, yellow-grapefruit pith and the slightest touch of marshmallow. The sip is more about chalky grip and the tightly woven texture than blunt flavors, with enough sour Key-lime and pink-grapefruit touches to entertain the palate."
Chardonnay,"Dark gold in color, this wine is marked by floral jasmine aromas before toasty oak and weightiness take over on the palate. Green apple and tropical flourishes provide additional richness."
Chardonnay,"This is what vineyard selection and winemaker intervention can do to enrich a wine.  Everything here is on steroids.  The fruit is deep and rich, the oak is smoky and spicy and the finish long and deep.  Pretty fancy stuff that might even improve with a few years in the cellar."
Chardonnay,"A pleasant aromatic mix of sweet buttercream with salted caramel join with pineapple and guava on this wine from the hills above Silicon Valley. It is nicely rounded on the palate, with pear, apple and more guava leading to a yeasty, acidic finish."
Chardonnay,"The cold and fog actually helped this Chardonnay, which achieves a remarkable delicacy and tartness despite the power of its fruit. Really remarkable for the flood of golden mango, Asian pear and Key lime pie richness, which is grounded by a firm minerality. Oak influence and aging on the lees lend the perfect touches of smoky, buttered toast and zesty creaminess to this dry, polished wine. A mere 587 cases were produced."
Chardonnay,"This is a crisp, clean and nicely-structured Chardonnay, fermented in a mix of new and neutral oak, along with some stainless steel. A bit beer-like and yeasty at first, it opens into pleasing flavors of grapefruit and pineapple, with just the right amount of acidity."
Chardonnay,"Lots of oak on this fresh, young Chard. It's a bit too heavy on the char, toast, vanilla, and woodsap, and not enough about the peaches, pears and pineapples."
Chardonnay,"This well-structured wine offers flavors of preserved lemon and grilled pineapple, while floral nuttiness and a cheese-like impression give it a hint of funk. It shows some barrel reduction, which blows off as it opens up."
Chardonnay,"A warm, rich wine, with cream and butter flavors lying over the more textured acidity. The wood is just noticeable, adding its smoky character to the yellow fruits and citrus."
Chardonnay,"Remarkably consistent in quality year after year, Peg Bay's 2007 Chardonnay opens with some slightly funky aromas that moderate with aeration to reveal a toasty, smoky wine with a core of melon fruit. It starts off seeming a touch narrow, but broadens and deepens on the palate, ending with impressive length."
Chardonnay,"Mild, melony aromas are tropical in nature and show an oily note of lanolin. This feels heavy, while pithy flavors of melon are full of skin-based pyrazines. Green, bitter flavors taste more of grape skins than fruit."
Chardonnay,"Entirely stainless-steel fermented, this wine offers lemon and lime in abundance, along with kiwi and sour apple. A tad disjointed, it tastes big and fuller bodied even without the oak."
Chardonnay,"Coming from one of the state's top Chardonnay sites, this wine offers pleasing aromas of crushed stone along with peach, cardamom and other spices. It's sleek in style, with a tart lick of acidity. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best."
Chardonnay,"From an estate site, this wine offers power and concentration. Creamy in texture, the generosity of fruit is balanced by notes of stone, toasted oak and French butter, making for a wonderfully complete experience on the palate."
Chardonnay,"This is a familiar and tasty take on the grape, with aromas of caramel, buttercream, vanilla smoke, brown spices and squeezed lemons. There's sea salt and lemon-lime on the palate, which is straightforward but quite clean and crisp."
Chardonnay,"Brassy in color and woody in aroma, this Chardonnay is a pleasant enough drink, offering ample weight and modest pear and citrus flavors. Drink it through 2017."
Chardonnay,"This vintage of Planeta's celebrated Chardonnay is full-bodied and lush, with notes of peach, yellow rose, vanilla and honey, framed by toasted hazelnuts. The wine delivers a creamy, almost chewy mouthfeel with power and intensity, and continues with a long, soft finish."
Chardonnay,"Squeezed lemon rinds and pith, wound up wet concrete notes, a touch of toasted almond and a slight show of nectarine flesh comprise the nose of this bottling. Classic Cali Chard buttery notes lead the sip, with ripe stonefruit, sea salt, caramel and jasmine, uplited by a decent acidity."
Chardonnay,"This medium-bodied Chardonnay has big aromas and flavors. It smells like toasted oak and pineapple, and tastes buttery and appley, with extra baking spice flavors and a smooth texture."
Chardonnay,"Notes of apple, yellow peach and pear are savory in tone in this unoaked Chardonnay. Dry in style, it's delicately concentrated with soft tangerine acidity. The finish is brisk but clean."
Chardonnay,"This lovely Chardonnay has just the right blend of juicy peaches and subtle herbs and flowers to make it easy to drink, yet interesting enough to hold your attention. Finishes long and mouthwatering."
Chardonnay,"Smooth, rich and beautifully textured, this opulent Chardonnay from cool-climate Alto Adige offers plush aromas of yellow fruit, rose, vanilla and toasted almond. You could pair Löwengang with shellfish or creamy risotto with wild mushrooms."
Chardonnay,"This wine is aromatically arresting, with notes of honeycomb, candle wax, corn husk, chamomile, almond and stone fruit. The palate has an outrageously textured, detailed, layered feel leading to an extended finish that displays both elegance and richness."
Chardonnay,"A big and friendly wine, with plenty of forward fruit mingling flavors of citrus, apples and pears. There is a nice blast of vanilla too, the only obvious sign of new oak aging, but the impression overall is of crisp, clean elegance. Best Buy."
Chardonnay,"Quite light, in both mouthfeel and flavor, this has simple, rather generic fruit and a bit of butter."
Chardonnay,"Lightly tropical and entirely mineral-driven, racing in acidity, this tightly wound wine is cradled in toasty, integrated oak that's still trying to let go. It shows hints of the goodness within, from crisp green apple to caramel and lemon meringue. Drink now through 2023."
Chardonnay,Light aromas of tropical fruits and white flowers are basic and open. An average feeling palate carries sweet flavors of tropical fruits like pineapple and mango accented by vanilla. Throw in a sprinkle of powdered sugar and you get the picture.
Chardonnay,"Fresh and straightforward on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas. The palate is pulpy but good, with flavors of fruit punch and melon. Turns a little sweet and pithy on the finish, but holds it together. Perfectly good for the price."
Chardonnay,"Ripe and fruit-forward, this round Chard boasts intense aromas and flavors of tropical fruit, pear and orange oil along with a hint of yellow florals. Subtle toast and clove spice accents remains on the finish. Drink now."
Chardonnay,A beautiful wine that has plenty of weight and also a firm structure of minerality to go with the yellow fruits that are now evolving into more mature flavors. It is by no means at its peak yet. Give it 2–3 years.
Chardonnay,"A soft, dilute wine, this is gently fruity. Acidity gives a lift at the end. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Judiciously balanced notes of toast, spice and vanilla augment crisp red apple and lemon tones in this brisk Chardonnay. Cutting minerality on the midpalate lends an invigorating freshness through the finish. Drink now through 2019."
Chardonnay,"Brilliant acidity and a firm minerality give this wine structural integrity despite massively ripe tropical fruit and honey flavors. It has a lush, rich opulence to pair with buttery lobster, shrimp, scallop and similarly rich dishes."
Chardonnay,"This faint, elusive wine takes lightness and low alcohol to pronounced levels, offering intense lemon and Asian pear around a tight core of acidity. From the Pratt Vineyard, it spent time aging in both new air-dried Vosges oak barrels and small stainless steel."
Chardonnay,"This smooth wine with a creamy texture also features a light shot of acidity as well as apple fruits. It is lively, crisp with acidity at the end and ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"The former race car driver hired Doug Margerum to make his wine. Though quite pale in color, this offers fragrant aromas of sea salt, rounded nectarine fruit, wisps of white flowers and the slightest show of almond macarons. Stone fruit pops out on the salty palate, but the bright acidity and chalky minerality slice deeply, ending on a dollop of vanilla cream."
Chardonnay,"This is an attractive light and fruity wine. It has fresh fruit flavors, with notes of crisp citrus and green apple. A touch of vanilla and a smooth texture surface as it opens up."
Chardonnay,"Aromas of this wine show considerable wood. On the palate, the wood is very present, giving acidity as well as layers of toast and spice. Hints of yellow fruit show through, suggesting the possibility of a ripe, rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,"A generous, smooth texture and nicely bright flavors of lemon, lime and apple make this a satisfying wine. It is medium to full bodied, soft in acidity, but fresh in flavor. It should be a winner for large groups."
Chardonnay,"Hints of smoke and toast add warmth to the fresh pear and blossom aromas. An easy-drinking blend of stainless-steel- and barrel-fermented wine, it's bright with fresh fruit, but it's lusciously textured on the palate."
Chardonnay,"Plenty of toastiness in this ripe wine gives an extra element of acidity that needs to be tamed. At the same time, it has good white- and citrus-fruit flavors. Drink this attractive wine from 2017."
Chardonnay,"Insanely rich, this explodes in the mouth with orange, pineapple, apricot, tropical fruit and sweet new-oak flavors. The richness is tempered with crisp acidity and a minerality that tastes like a lick of cold steel. This is a good price for a Santa Lucia Chardonnay this rich and appealing."
Chardonnay,"Caramel aromas lead to a wine that is rich and full bodied. It has weight and concentration, along with fresh acidity that cuts through at the end. A good sense of minerality gives this wine extra texture. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,"Located on the right bank of the Serein, this vineyard produces rich warm wines. This is a ripe full wine with great white fruits that are balanced by spice and fine acidity. The texture is dense and full—a generous wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,"Tastes like orange juice with an extra hit of white sugar, sprinkled with cinnamon, vanilla and an oaky sweetness."
Chardonnay,"This is a ripe, fruity, creamy Chardonnay-based sparkler. It has a tropical fruit flavor, with some sweetness from both the fruit and the high dosage. It's in a full-bodied, attractive apéritif style."
Chardonnay,"This is pure and intense with layers of limes, kiwis, apricots, oranges, pineapples and golden mangoes. Only neutral oak was used, providing background hints of buttered toast. The winemaker did not put the wine through malolactic fermentation, resulting in wonderfully bright acidity."
Chardonnay,"This is a delicious, soft, tropical fruit-flavored wine. The texture is ripe, full, the mango fruits melting in the mouth, just touched by spice. If it misses the more mineral character of Chablis, the pleasure is sufficient compensation. Screwcap."
Chardonnay,"A taut, steely, very mineral wine, showing a tense, textured character. Fruit flavors run from grapefruit to peach, with a delicious tang of zest along the way. With its acidity and structure, this is a wine for long-term aging."
Chardonnay,"Very intense, very nervy wine, living on a thin wire of grapefruit and other citrus flavors but much more about pure structure. The aftertaste shows great concentration."
Chardonnay,"Rich and ripe, this intense wine is verging into tropical land with pineapple and mango, plus an overreaching expression of oak and vanilla. It offers medium- to full-bodied weight and a big finish."
Chardonnay,"A simple wine, with sugary pineapple jam and buttered popcorn flavors, overwhelmed by sweet oak."
Chardonnay,"A wine that is destined for good aging, with its mineral structure and toast flavors. It has weight and richness but equally it has intense pear and citrus fruits layered with acidity. Age for at least four years."
Chardonnay,"This Chard bowls it right down the middle of today's popular taste, offering ripe tangerine, apricot and mango flavors, enriched with plenty of caramelized oak. It's not particularly complex. Drink up."
Chardonnay,"There is an important element of wood here, along with a ripe, creamy texture. By contrast, the structure is mineral, lifted with grapefruit flavors. The wood supports this fruit, giving a complete, mouth filling wine."
Chardonnay,"Light, clean and citrusy aromas of lemon, lime and grapefruit skin meet with a dollop of white peach and dusting of crushed slate on the nose of this wine. A fine-pointed acidity carries nectarine, pluot and Asian pear flavors across the palate, which trends racy, bright and slightly sour, with a chalky structure."
Chardonnay,"Lovely white-flower aromas of lily, tuberose and plumeria are elegant and engaging without being overpowering. These pair nicely with the light mango, crushed sea shell and petrol touch of the nose. Coconut, both dried flakes and milk, shows strongly on the creamy sip, along with honeysuckle, pineapple and fragrant white fruit."
Chardonnay,"The flint and chalk nature of the soil shows in this wine. From old vines well situated in the Premier Cru of Montmains, it has concentration and a tight, young texture that will need to develop. It is fresh and full of citrus now, although a riper, creamy character will be coming through as it matures. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,"An oaky, ripe style of California Chardonnay, this tastes like a dessert pastry of citrus and tropical fruits, vanilla wafer and sugar. Brisk acidity goes a long way toward providing balance."
Chardonnay,"The buttered toast and vanilla bean flavors of oak barrels dominate this Chardonnay. Underneath that is a good wine, crisp in acidity and ripe in lime, mango and apricot fruit flavors. It's ready to drink now."
Chardonnay,"This Chardonnay has depth, starting with its unfolding nose of ripe Chardonnay fruit, minerals, hazelnut and citrus. The palate offers flavors of pear, citrus and grapefruit, its character refreshing and fruity but somewhat complex. An impressive white that can handle richer dishes."
Chardonnay,"Not all that expressive on the nose; about all you get is basic yellow fruit and lettuce. The palate shows more intensity, but the flavors of lemon and tropical fruits are basic at best. Chunky, sweet and common on the finish. Good for Argentina but still it leaves you asking for more."
Chardonnay,"Solidly built, almost chunky, the accent flavors suggest time spent in a percentage of new wood. Citrus and apple are cloaked in oaky spices and barrel flavors of toast, vanilla and butter."
Chardonnay,"Really toasty, honey and lemon style of Chardonnay, tight and crisp. There are plenty of green plum and grapefruit flavors. Deliciously crisp, while also ripe."
Chardonnay,"Strong butterscotch aromas and rich, seemingly sweet caramel and melted-butter flavors give this full-bodied wine a syrupy character. The balance is quite soft and oaky components overwhelm the fruity ones."
Chardonnay,"Broad and generous, this has ample white fruits and attractive, balancing acids. It already has richness and a pure fruit character, with a firm, pear-skin-like structure and acidity on the finish. Age the for 3–4 years."
Chardonnay,"Full-bodied and ripe, this offers fruitiness that has been filled out with wood aging. It's a good expression of Chardonnay from southern Burgundy, with ripe yellow fruits and citrus and a juicy-toasty aftertaste. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Oily citrus and barrel-based smoke aromas set up a palate that's deep and powerful. Flavors of spiced apple, citrus and butterscotch are solid and don't fade over the course of a long, slightly pithy tasting finish."
Chardonnay,"A vitamin pill scent greets you immediately, somewhat masking the fruit. In the mouth it's rather light, watery and showing green apple fruit with plenty of acid. The finish softens up but doesn't add any depth or flavor."
Chardonnay,"Oak sticks out, giving a caramelized richness that dominates the underlying fruit. While it's dry and moderate in alcohol, it tastes and feels overly-manipulated."
Chardonnay,"A bit rough and scoury in texture, but otherwise this dry sparkling wine has rich, complex flavors of citrus fruits, strawberries, brioche and vanilla. Shows fine Mendocino acidity that makes it finish brisk and clean."
Chardonnay,"This Chardonnay is extremely close in style and complexity to Gary Farrell's best single-vineyard bottlings, for a lower price. The wine is mouthwatering in acidity, with rich tropical fruit, peach and lime flavors."
Chardonnay,"Lush and aromatic, with ripe pear and melon fruit, sweet spices and a streak of vanilla. The 20% new oak seems just right, and the flavors persist through a seductively long finish."
Chardonnay,"Yering Station makes a regular Chardonnay and a Reserve Chardonnay as well; this is its entry-level Chard, and quite a good one. Bright pineapple notes and a hint of grilled fruit are clean and fresh if somewhat straightforward in this medium-bodied wine. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Bright, forward fruit and spice characterize this very rich, complex wine. The aromas veer toward banana and ripe peach and pear, with oriental spices, vanilla, and toast. In the mouth, the flavors are fruity, with a leesy streak. High acidity makes it a little sharp, while the texture is creamy. All in all, it's very balanced, except for that sharpness, which a year or two of aging should mellow."
Chardonnay,"Not afraid to wear high alcohol and toasty oak on its sleeve, it kicks off with a marshmallow, whipped cream and macadamia-nut nose, making it perfect for those who love the California cocktail style but are seeking nuance as well. On the palate, the wine is soft and buttery, with a long buttercream finish. Pair with oven-roasted chicken."
Chardonnay,"This Chardonnay is one of the family-owned winery's workhorse bottlings, and it pulls its weight with finesse, showing light aromas of Pink Lady apple, grapefruit peel and almond on the nose. Lemon-lime acidity frames each sip, while grapefruit flavors meld with lemongrass and kaffir lime, finishing on riper stone fruit notes."
Chardonnay,"This shows the streamlined acidity and minerality of a fine coastal Chardonnay, as well as the dryness. But the ripeness is impressive, suggesting notes of Key lime pie, lemon meringue and ripe, sweet kiwi, with subtle oak influence. An impressive wine from start to finish."
Chardonnay,"Made in an appealing popular style, this Chard has ripe flavors of pineapples, pears, peaches and figs, with oak barrel notes of creamy vanilla and smoke."
Chardonnay,"A very fine Chardonnay notable for its concentration, power and elegance. Framed in well-oaked flavors of smoky vanilla and honey, the underlying fruit is very ripe in peaches, pears and figs, balanced with racy acidity. Delicious now, and should hold for five years or so."
Chardonnay,"From a dependable producer and a fine vintage comes a problematic wine. The fruit is nicely ripe and suggestive of apples and peaches, and it's balanced and dry. Acidity is adequate. The only jarring note is a strongly toasted character, almost like charcoal, which you can both smell it and taste. Even the finish is marred by this burnt flavor."
Chardonnay,"A beautiful wine, crisp and elegant, filled with varietal complexity. Oak-inspired butterscotch and vanilla custard accent ripe fruit flavors of grilled pineapples and ripe kiwi, with a long, spicy finish. Beautiful now and for a year or two."
Chardonnay,"There's a cotton candy aroma on the nose of this bottling that builds toward tropical fruit scents, such as guava, papaya and cherimoya. Apple pie, mango and coconut cream notes cling to a steely line of structure, feeling clean and crisp on the palate. A pop of bubblegum shows on the finish."
Chardonnay,"This is a beautiful Chardonnay—dry, sleek and refined. Beyond the subtle tropical fruit, citrus and green apple flavors is a steely minerality and lemony acidity that get the mouth watering. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Very concentrated and closed up, like a coil. The intense green fruit is followed by plum skins. Crispness, dry but fresh, comes alongside a powerful explosion of flavors."
Chardonnay,"Medium bodied and restrained on the palate, this wine offers a mix of caramelized lemon and Gravenstein apple. It ends lengthy with tastes of ginger and lemongrass that leave a refreshing finish."
Chardonnay,"This is nice and hints at greater things, but ultimately it's more modest and fluffy than substantive. Aromas of oak resin, baked apple and vanilla introduce a palate with mild acidity and not much structure. Vanilla, caramel, banana and honey- dew flavors finish soft."
Chardonnay,"Showing the richness of the vineyard, this delivers huge, flamboyant flavors of apricot and tangerine jam. While it's technically dry, there's a honeyed sweetness that suggests a touch of botrytis. It's a strong wine, unafraid to command a boldness that may not be for everyone. This is distinctly Californian in style, and as it loses fruit with age, it will develop nut and earthy notes."
Chardonnay,"This is the Hearst family's run at a luxury-level Chardonnay, and it's a promising start, with creamy aromas of honeysuckle, light butter and citrus rinds. There's a touch of vanilla bean on the palate, which also shows apple ice cream, flashes of cinnamon and a firmly wound texture. It's delicate, clean, light and quaffable."
Chardonnay,"Opens with mellow peach and melon aromas and some oak. The palate is round, creamy and full, but hollow in the center. Tastes of spiced, dried apple with a stalky, pithy accent. Easy and basic on the finish, and overall it's pricey for what's in the bottle."
Chardonnay,"For Spanish Chardonnay, this is perfectly good and clean. The nose brings your basic set of white-fruit, mineral and fresh herb flavors, while the palate is lively despite some dry, resiny oak flavor. Even with banana, vanilla and creamy flavors, the wine is decidedly not cloying."
Chardonnay,"Aged in neutral French oak with partial malolactic fermentation, this vineyard-designated wine offers aromas of almond, mineral, green apple and spice. It's lighter in style, texture-driven with a good sense of balance throughout."
Chardonnay,"This is a floral, zesty and vibrant white wine, given six months in French oak, half of it new. With a complex hit of briny salt and citrus, it flirts between layers of savory and sweet, finding just the right balance of structure and acidity."
Chardonnay,"This is a gentle and attractively fruity wine. Ripe and full, it also has a sense of tangy structure and citrus juice. The wine is developing well and will be ready to drink from summer 2017."
Chardonnay,"Hailing from the winery's Los Alamos Valley Vineyard that lines Highway 101, this wine is quite light in color and shows delicate, clean honeydew, honey dust and apple-blossom candy aromas. It's light yet playful in the glass, with limestone, lime rind and green apple flavors. It's straightforward but well assembled."
Chardonnay,"A nice Chardonnay that feels pedigreed and well-made, with crisp acidity and a creamy texture framing very ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors. The oak dominates, however, making the wine heavy in sweet, caramelized toast."
Chardonnay,"A simple, straightforward wine, this has an attractive mineral, tangy texture to go with the bright citrus fruit. Crisp and refreshing, it is ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"A touch of salted caramel appears before the flesh of ripe yellow apples takes over on the nose. The palate sings with freshness and presents a mousse of tiny pin-prick bubbles. The spicy but rich notion of salted caramel tantalizes again on a bone-dry palate. This wine is both weightless and profound, with lovely length and a lip-smacking finish."
Chardonnay,"Subtly nutty on the nose with a hint of lemony perfume, this Chardonnay sparkler is pleasantly brisk but a little dilute on the palate. Small bubbles are soft and gently mouthfilling."
Chardonnay,"A fine Chardonnay, showing cool weather influence in the brisk acidity and ripe flavors, which veer toward tart green apples, peaches and tangerines. The oak has been tastefully applied."
Chardonnay,"Slightly funk kiwi, dried apples and dried white-flower aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend. Flavors are flat and muted, with a flash of sweet apples."
Chardonnay,"A touch of blossom honey enriches the tart but ripe apple notes of the nose. On the palate that honeyed touch turns into lemony, golden shortbread while the tart apple notes are joined by fresh, ripe lemon. Thousands of tiny, pin-prick bubbles make for a creamy, elegant mousse. The contrast between honeyed, autolytic richness and bright, pure citrus is a joy. This wine is exciting and elegant, drawing you to its mellower, richer core. The purity on the finish is luminous and long."
Chardonnay,"This is a good, dry Chardonnay, marked by brisk acidity and a steely minerality. The fruit veers toward pineapples and apricots, while oak adds notes of buttered toast and caramel. Feels like it wants to be richer than it is, but it's elegant."
Chardonnay,"This is a soft and creamy wine, ripe with baked apple and crisp pear flavors. Balanced and full in the mouth, it attractive and ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"A mix of fruity notes immediately hit: white currant, gooseberry, apple and citrus. The palate is slender and fizzes with those primary fruit flavors that have overtones of meadow flowers. This is frothy, refreshing and fun on the surface, but there is serious backbone and intent."
Chardonnay,"This primarily barrel-fermented and barrel-aged Chardonnay offers toasty oak on the nose and a palate rounded out by expressive fruit. Soft and friendly, it has a lingering finish but is not overly complex. Pair wth game birds and seafood."
Chardonnay,"Concentrated white fruits, layering melon, pear and red apples with the balancing acidity. For a Chablis, it is ripe and opulent, a delicious already approachable product of the warm year. It does have texture to age well."
Chardonnay,"Produced from old, low-yielding vines, this delicious wine balances crisp acidity with intense white fruit. It's poised and stylish, with a cool character expressed in its acidity and lemon zest-like aftertaste. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Grapes come from both the Knights Valley and Napa County for this wine, named by former model and Real Housewife Brandi Glanville. Bold as Brandi, it shows a hit of oak around thick waves of anise, vanilla and melon, ready for anything."
Chardonnay,"A fine vintage of this always delicious Chablis. The wine has weight, a sense of warmth from its yellow fruits and depth of flavor. Full and ripe in the mouth, it will age for a year, although it is drinkable already."
Chardonnay,"From vines that sit at 1,000 feet overlooking Monterey and the Carmel Valley, this wine only went through partial malolactic fermentation. It shows a tight nose of lemon-laced sour cream and grapefruit blossoms. Lime peels, more sour cream and stronger grapefruit-pith flavors mark the tight, tart palate that has firmness that will mellow with age."
Chardonnay,"Ripe and full, this is an apricot-and melon-flavored wine. With this ripeness comes a soft texture that offers some warm acidity and a perfumed aftertaste. From 50+-year-old vines, the wine is attractive now and ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"The pear, apple, toast and cinnamon aromas are light and elusive. The flavors are elegant, with the concentration trailing toward the finish."
Chardonnay,"From Pierre André's Château Corton-André, they can look up at the hill of Corton and the Corton-Charlemagne vineyard. That gives them a neighborly interest. This is reflected in this rich, powerful, muscular wine, full of yellow fruit, ripe wood and tense acidity. It should age for 4–5 years."
Chardonnay,"This ripe, smoothly textured wine is rich with apricot and white-peach fruits. Light wood flavors add spice and fill out the texture. With its generous weight, the wine is going to be full and ripe from 2018."
Chardonnay,"Big, rich and oaky, this is marked by buttered toast, orange cream and pineapple custard flavors."
Chardonnay,"This is a great example of what most would consider a straight-ahead and delicious California Chardonnay. The nose offers aromas of seared pineapple cake, vanilla soda and Meyer lemon, and the palate blends all of the typical elements: lemon juice acidity down the middle, minerality driven by slate and white rocks, apple and a bit of brown spice on the edges."
Chardonnay,"Lush in winemaker Brian Loring's preferred style, this wine shows roasted cashews, seared lemons and baked apples on the nose. There's a walnut-oil quality to the palate, which is chewy and fat but not overreaching, with touches of tonic, cinnamon and caramel."
Chardonnay,"Lemon meringue and custard provide decadence to this vineyard-designated wine, the site planted to decades-old vines. It becomes sublime as it opens, spicy and soft in quince and Asian pear. The finish returns to the opening theme, delivering a punch of caramel."
Chardonnay,"The aromas are restrained and mellow in this bottling from winemaker Tyler Thomas, showing mostly yellow apple and citrus peel notes. The palate is racy, high-toned and steely in structure, framed by a razor-sharp edge of zippy acidity, with only faint background notes of ripe stonefruit."
Chardonnay,"Lemondrop, buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors mark this soft, opulent Chardonnay. It becomes a little cloying on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Winemaker: Miles Mossop. There's beautiful concentration yet ample freshness to the ripe wood-grilled apple, pineapple, melon and lemon-curd aromas and flavors in this wine. A hint of toasted brioche adds depth, while accents of fresh herbs and pressed yellow flower add an earthy elegance. The palate is full and round, yet not overly so, with ample acidity to lift the mouthfeel while lingering flavors of apple pie and spiced orange dance seductively on the finish. Drink now–2022."
Chardonnay,"This is a fine example of a sun-drenched Chardonnay from central Italy that boasts a saturated, golden color and savory exotic fruit, vanilla, butter and natural rubber. It's viscous with streaks of glycerin that slowly make their way down the side of the glass and offers a creamy, sweet, sensation in the mouth."
Chardonnay,"With subtle wood aging, this is a smooth wine that has hints of toast over its delicious white and apricot fruits. Orange zest tang gives a delicious bite and texture, suggesting how well the wine will age. Drink this fruity wine from 2017."
Chardonnay,"Pink grapefruit, a linear chalky component and the aromas of apricot jam on brie cheese rind show on the nose of this bottling from one of the region's oldest vineyards. There is tight focus to the palate, where green pear skins, pomelo pith, lemon zest and lime juice weave into an acidity that's strong yet expertly integrated."
Chardonnay,"This has a warm, rounded character, with pressing minerality. Notes of apple, pear and a touch of vanilla all add richness and an open character. It has warm, rich fruit on the finish."
Chardonnay,"This tangy wine has attractive acidity and a tightly coiled mineral texture. Apple and lemon flavors shoot right through the bright, crisp texture. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,"Crisp and structured, this is an intensely mineral wine. It has great acidity and a strongly zesty, tangy character that still needs time to soften. It's bright, fruity and full of dancing freshness. It's good to go now, but keep until 2017 and it will be that much more complex."
Chardonnay,"Shows the crisp acidity and delicately silky mouthfeel of Carneros Chard, with ripe flavors of pineapples, guavas, kiwis and minerals. Could be a tad drier, but it's a pretty nice wine."
Chardonnay,"This bottling always strives to avoid a heavy hand and express more of a terroir-driven Chardonnay. This is bone dry, tart in mouthwatering acidity and complex in citrus, tropical fruit and herb flavors. It's not an opulent attention getter, but instead prefers to seduce through subtlety and nuance."
Chardonnay,"Spice, lees and custard aromas are followed by creamy-feeling fruit flavors that taper slightly toward the finish."
Chardonnay,"Fermented and aged in Burgundian oak, this is intended to evoke a traditional Meursault style. It isn't far from the mark; soft and oaky, it's a bit like biting into a ripe banana squished between two graham crackers. Other tropical fruit flavors are in evidence: mango, pineapple and papaya. It's an easy-drinking style that will have a lot of consumer appeal."
Chardonnay,"This bright and well-balanced sparkler leads with attractive aromas of fresh lemon and orange slices, lightly toasted brioche and subtle fynbos herbs. The palate is creamy and smooth, with crisp acidity and medium carbonation that lifts and refreshes the finish. Delicious now, or hold through 2017 for a more mature character and additional depth."
Chardonnay,"The Adelaide Hills is one of Australia's best sources of high-quality Chardonnay. This is a fine example, marrying toasted grain aromas with peach and citrus flavors and a touch of vanilla. It's soft, lush and promises easy drinking over the next year or two."
Chardonnay,"Golden in color, this wine has a light presence on the palate, offering both floral and herbal highlights of jasmine and cinnamon. A faint squeeze of citrus is perceptible throughout, before the wine finishes in a flash."
Chardonnay,A sugary Chardonnay whose main attraction is its honey flavor. That gives a dessert wine sweetness to the pineapple and lemon fruit. Ready now.

Chardonnay,"This well-made wine in a rich style smells like ripe pears and melted butter, and tastes soft and almost sweet, resembling pear and peach juice. The texture is smooth and soft and the body is medium, so it's easy to enjoy."
Chardonnay,"True to the Pride style, this Chardonnay is massively constructed, with an enormous blast of pineapple, orange and golden mango fruit, elaborated with sweet, smoky, caramelized oak. It's saved from being a mere fruit bomb by crisp acidity and a bracing minerality. Drink now for sheer hedonistic freshness."

Chardonnay,"This bottling shows its 88% stainless steel aging with bountiful tropicality, including guava and tuberose on the nose as well as toasted nuts and honeydew. Crisp lime peels start the sip, and then come more guava touches as well as mango. It's quite fruity."
Chardonnay,"This Chard is rich yet crisply acidic and complex. Shows plenty of new French oak, but wears it well, with the pineapple, mango, honeysuckle and mineral flavors standing up. Delicious now, and will hold in the bottle for 4–5 years."

Chardonnay,"This delicious wine balances acidity and citrus fruits with riper melon and pear flavors. It offers an attractive, refreshing crisp edge. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"With fruit drawn from all over Burgundy, this is a light, bright and refreshing wine. It has light acidity, spice and apple flavors and a bright, tight aftertaste. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Testarossa's single-vineyard expertise shines on this wine from Rosella's, which is fresh and alive on the nose with ripe nectarine and grapefruit peel. The acidity carries prominently on the palate, but the ruby-red grapefruit elements are not sharp, possessing both sweet and savory sides and finishing with some bitterness. Serve with honey-glazed seared scallops."
Chardonnay,"Made from Chardonnay, this pretty sparkling wine from northern Italy opens with a delicate fragrance of white fleshy fruit and walnut. The crisp, refreshing palate offers green apple and a hint of almond."
Chardonnay,"There's lots of acidity in this young wine, which gives it a slightly minty, prickly feeling that actually adds to its food-friendliness. With pineapple, green apple, spice and smoky oak flavors, it finishes thoroughly dry. Easy to find, with 30,000 case production."
Chardonnay,"High acidity marks this vibrant wine, which is from one of Kendall-Jackson's coolest coastal vineyards. The crispness lends a vibrant tension to the intense flavors of Meyer lemons, orange blossom and minerals, while oak adds softer, spicy notes. Feels racy and nervy all through, in a delicious way."
Chardonnay,"Concentrated, delicious fruit flavors and subtle spiciness make a great combination in this harmonious and full-bodied wine. There is no obvious oak character, but it tastes like a gently barrel-fermented wine that developed hints of cream, nutmeg and honey along with a river of ripe pear and peach."
Chardonnay,"Smooth and creamy, with mineral-infused pineapple crème brûlée, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors. Rich, if a little direct. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"A sharp brine character gets warmer boosts from underlying pear, nectarine and buttered sourdough aromas. Flavors are light and bright at first, with sandy clay, vanilla cookie and custard strudel emerging on the midpalate and a line of acidity down through the finish."
Chardonnay,"Creamy and well-integrated, this offers personality and style. The crisp bite of green apple and lemon curd are textured and long-lasting. With its overall balance, it is a fantastically versatile pairing option."

Chardonnay,"The aromas are bright, with notes of melon, pear and herb. It drinks dry, with tart lemony flavors. The concentration doesn't seem all there."
Chardonnay,"Light cinnamon and sugar aromas, and fresh, fruity and lightly sweet flavors make this wine easy on the palate. The texture is soft."
Chardonnay,"This unique old vine Chardonnay vineyard makes cool-climate grape flavors as interesting and complex as any fruit bomb. Spring herb, light floral, citrus and grapefruit combine in a delicate, elegant wine. It's Chablis without the chalk; plenty of acid."
Chardonnay,"This is full-bodied, offering subtle cashew and melon shadings alongside bold pineapple fruit. The oak stands a little apart on the palate, imparting a touch of dryness to the bright fruit. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Toasty, mealy aromas combine with peach and smoke in a beguiling, complex nose that resembles a fine Chassagne-Montrachet. Flavors of peach and citrus coat the palate without ever seeming overly rich, heavy or oily, extending through the long ripe-citrus finish."
Chardonnay,"Thick, rich and ripe in vanilla, the American oak in this wine is pronounced and intense, wrapping itself around notes of candied apple and toffee-caramel."
Chardonnay,"Voluptuously succulent and welcoming, this coastal wine seduces with its caramel apple, pear and preserved lemon flavors, edged with high-toned acidity and an exotic touch of seaspray. That sense of the sea plays out on the palate in texture, too, with a stony note that lingers in nutty spice."
Chardonnay,"Subtle hints of vanilla, lavender and spice lend depth to pristine peach and pear flavors in this judiciously balanced Chardonnay. It's fleshy and plump in mouthfeel but zesty lime notes keep the finish vibrant. Drink now through 2020."
Chardonnay,"The latest release of the legendary Comtes de Champagne comes from a great vintage. It has full, toasty bottle-age notes that give the wine depth of flavor, with a ripe, rounded mouthfeel and taut acidity. An almond note combines with the citrus-driven acidity on the finish."
Chardonnay,"With its mineral character, freshness and tight, taut structure, this is a promising wine, flavors of green fruits giving some richness but more crispness."
Chardonnay,"Tropical and a bit briney on the nose. The palate is healthy in feel, with sweet white fruit flavors, a pinch of lemon and creamy oak. Finishes quick, with a nice feel and adequate acidity; will do best if well chilled."
Chardonnay,"Waxy, floral white-fruit aromas are tropical in style. This feels citrusy, with some pulpiness to the texture. Tangerine, orange and nectarine flavors finish tangy and citric, with one-dimensional juiciness."
Chardonnay,"Oak stars in this wine, to its detriment. Underneath all that wood is a crisply elegant Chardonnay with ripe pear, peach and papaya flavors. But the oak plasters it with a ton of caramel and butterscotch that tastes excessive."
Chardonnay,"Made in the Ojai style of modest alcohol, dryness and delicacy, this offers subtle citrus, tropical fruit and mineral flavors. It's not terribly complex, but it is streamlined and elegant. Drink up."
Chardonnay,"This smells both dry and oily, with apple and melon notes. The palate is round and healthy in feel, while flavors of honeyed apple and white peach turn more briny and pyrazinic as this breathes and finishes."
Chardonnay,"The fruit flavors of apples and dried apricots are enhanced with notes of toasted walnuts and sweet grain. Made from estate-grown Chardonnay, this is lush and fruity, with complex detailing from having fermented in Hungarian oak puncheons."
Chardonnay,"This wine offers a bouquet of baking bread with a touch of lemon curd. It presents a sophisticated palate of lemon, lime, orange blossom, piecrust, and eucalyptus. It has pleasing acidity that overcomes cooling herb flavors on the finish, and while it is light in the mouth, soft tannins persist on the gum line for a short while after swallowing."
Chardonnay,"This resplendent white offers a wealth of wet stone minerality and crisp, lemony acidity, with just a subtle hint of oak. From old vines, it boasts tangerine and anise flavors on the palate, with tropical notes of guava and mango and a jolt of nuttiness."
Chardonnay,"This dry, acidic, minerally Chardonnay brings Burgundy to mind. It has a lot going for it, but is rather tight and angular despite a rich vein of pineapple and lemon drop. Distinguished in its way, it's a fine wine, at a great price."
Chardonnay,"Using grapes sourced from the greatest white-wine vineyard in Burgundy, this is huge, dense, very rich and complex. The balance already shows in the wine's acidity, ripe yellow fruit and round texture. Wood aging brings notes of spice and toast. This will age for many years."
Chardonnay,"High, brisk acidity is the star in this Central Coast Chard. It gives a good kick to the ripe guava, nectarine, mineral and vanilla flavors. Good value, and very versatile with food."
Chardonnay,"Here is an oak-aged Chardonnay with overtones of toast, vanilla and roasted almond that sit squarely besides well-integrated notes of exotic fruit, honey and apricot. The oak element is strong, however, and transfers to the mouth in the form of intensity and length."
Chardonnay,"As delicious as its 2012 counterpart, yet needing more time, this vineyard-designate shines in high acidity and swirls of lemon and tangerine, remaining balanced in weight and volume in body and structure. With suggestions of ginger throughout, it finishes briny."
Chardonnay,"This beautifully balanced wine shows toast that counterpoints the generous yellow fruits and acidity. It's a ripe wine, touched by honey, spice and peach flavors. The aftertaste, with its total freshness, is crisp, lively, mouthfilling and refreshing. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,"Almost as buttery as a croissant, this full-bodied and extremely flavorful wine has an aroma like butterscotch, flavor like melted butter and vanilla, and a lingering pastry-like accent on the finish. The texture is buttery, too, coating the palate and revealing layers of richness."
Chardonnay,"Fresh floral and stone-fruit aromas take a swirl into butter and crème brûlée on the nose of this elegant Chardonnay. It's a straightforward wine, yet delectably composed with rich, silky texture and a zippy, fresh finish."
Chardonnay,"Bold flavors and plenty of creamy texture make this full-bodied wine seem big and mouth-filling. It offers nice lemon and butter aromas, ripe pear and spicy nutmeg flavors along with a smoky overtone that lasts from the aroma to the finish."
Chardonnay,"Salted peanuts in the aroma and buttered popcorn in the flavor make this an especially vivid wine that shows the dramatic effect of oak aging and malolactic fermentation. It is medium to full bodied, and has a soft, almost sweet sensation on the palate."
Chardonnay,"The fantastic nose pitches French toast together with Meyer lemon pith, crushed rock, struck match and a slight sour-cream element. This wine is immediately lively on the tongue, with lots of but not overdone acidity. Yeasty toast flavors are cut by lemon and poached pear on a racy and focused palate."
Chardonnay,"With old vines from a single vineyard, this wine has some good weight and concentration. Ripe peach and pineapple flavors are supported by a touch of spice as well as a warm finish. Screwcap."
Chardonnay,"Initial aromas of corn chips and banana mix in toast and vanilla. The palate is more direct and fruity, with baked apple and lemony flavors sharing time with sweet, resiny oak. Vanilla and later bitterness carry the finish. A wine that shows better in the mouth than on the nose."
Chardonnay,"Made in stainless-steel tanks and a mix of French and American oak barrels, this new, low-priced, low-in-alcohol white is straightforward in its rich layers of butterscotch and tropical vanilla, with a roundness that many will find attractive."
Chardonnay,"Very buttery aromas lead to a wine that is ripe, rounded and full in the mouth. The acidity is masked by the richness, leaving apricot rather than citrus as the dominant character."
Chardonnay,"Ripe, rich apricot and peach flavors are accented by touches of bramble and earth in this slightly rustic yet elegant Chardonnay. Tangerine acidity jolts the midpalate, leading a fresh, crisp finish."
Chardonnay,"Rich flavors of peaches, pears, buttercream and toast appear in this dry Chardonnay, which shows no signs of tiredness, although many 2007s do. The chief problem is excessive softness. It lacks balancing acidity and brightness."
Chardonnay,"Fruity and oaky, if a bit direct. It offers vanilla, buttered popcorn, pineapple crème brûlée and Asian spice flavors. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Citrus and apricot aromas are basic. This feels dilute but fresh. Peppery, slightly bitter and stalky white-fruit flavors finish similarly."
Chardonnay,"Estate grown, this is the only white from the Wayfarer Vineyard out on the Fort Ross-Seaview coast, and it's stunning. Culled from several distinct blocks planted to a handful of clones, including Mt. Eden and Old Wente, the aromas are pretty in orange blossom and peach, the body expansive and flinty. Succulent, the wine offers a lot of layered complexity, making it enjoyable now and through 2020–2022."
Chardonnay,"Fermented with 30% new American oak, it's direct and appealing with notes of melted caramel, vanilla, and toast. The flavors are rich and medium bodied, finishing a bit short."
Chardonnay,"Named after the matriarch of the De Martino family, this is a tropical-influenced wine with full banana, papaya and melon flavors atop lighter-weight aromas. The finish is equally tropical in style, with creamy oak mixing with ripe banana to create a sundae-like whole. The palate is chewy and satisfying as the wine tips the scale toward full bodied. Best Buy."
Chardonnay,"This blanc de blancs, fermented and aged in wood, is a fine Champagne. Its mineral texture and light oxidative character from the use of wood is contrasted with the tight citrus fruitiness and nervy steely texture. The wine is just mature although still with plenty of fruit. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Marked by zesty acidity and dryness, this Chard shows long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, lemons and sweet green apples. Minerality grounds the fruit, making the wine savory and clean. Gets better as it warms in the glass, a very good sign."
Chardonnay,"Crisp and luscious, this coastal Chardonnay shows off its cool-climate origins and fine vintage. Displays ripe pineapple tart, green apple butter and flamboyant lime flavors, enriched with sweet smoky oak, and balanced with clean, citrusy acidity."
Chardonnay,"Honey butter, vanilla bean and dried banana aromas emerge on the nose of this Chard. The palate shows seared apple slices cut with lemon juice, boosted by minerally tension and a peppery energy."
Chardonnay,"Without any new oak or lees stirring, this wine's sole focus is on the fruit. Pineapple, melon and peach notes are pure and striking, supported by just hints of vanilla and cream. This medium-bodied Chardonnay finishes in a flurry of tangerine and lime."
Chardonnay,"Soft and buttery, this wine is smooth and creamy with hints of citrus and a tangy backdrop. With a lightly toasty edge, the wine finishes more tightly than it starts. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"Just below the main street of Chassagne-Montrachet village, this vineyard has produced a beautiful wine. Apples and crisp citrus are allied with the lightest touch of wood to give a dancing, juicy wine with serious depths of flavor. Bright and young to drink now, it will age gently into a riper future. Drink now, but the wine will be much better from 2018."
Chardonnay,"This is pure, focused Russian River Valley at its most exuberant, full bodied and dark in color. Textured layers of pear, honey and melon dance around good, tight acidity, allowing for a balance of decadent pleasure."
Chardonnay,Well structured wine with plenty of ripe fruit. The freshness of fruit is replaced by spice and peach flavors.
Chardonnay,"The 2006 Chardonnay is another excellent bottle from this Oregon négociant, offering ripe and luscious fruit flavors of pear, apple, quince and kiwi. As the wine broadens out across the palate, streaks of spice, nutmeg, honey and graham cracker appear. It retains its acidic underpinnings through a generous, creamy finish."
Chardonnay,"Shy on the nose, this 100% Chardonnay from the winery's Vineburg and Firetree vineyards is entirely barrel-fermented and the oak shows mostly on the finish. On the palate, expect ripe pear, Good & Plenty licorice and a slight zippiness."
Chardonnay,"Initially soft, this wine then reveals a firmer structure, and a salty and mineral texture. There is an element of toastiness, rounding out the crisp apple and citrus fruit flavors. A cool, elegant wine."
Chardonnay,"Warm butter and light toasted oak scents meld with smoked lemon and walnut hints on the nose of this reserve bottling. The palate is soft and almost sweet upon entry, its cashew and roasted apple flavors buttressed by a grippy tannic texture."
Chardonnay,"Full in the mouth, this rich wine is dominated by yellow fruits and ripe apricots lifted by a touch of toast. Great acidity conveys a fresh and tangy character. The wine is still developing as the full fruitiness comes forward. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,"Sweetly fruity and brisk in acidity, this Chardonnay shows savory pineapple, orange and mango flavors that taste like an upscale fruit-juice drink. Oak gives it a toasty, buttery note, while the alcohol brings warmth and full-bodiedness."
Chardonnay,"Soft, rounded, broadened by a touch of toast, this is a ripe and honeyed wine, the acidity very present, balanced by intense pear and grapefruit flavors."
Chardonnay,This wine sports a green-apple and pear nose with some extra weight from barrel fermentation. Well-balanced and right on the border between stainless- steel and barrel-fermented styles: steel meets butter on the palate. Best Buy.
Chardonnay,"This is a moderately rich Chardonnay, loaded with hints of pineapples, white peaches and roasted cashews. It's round in the mouth, delivering ample weight and complexity, yet finishes long, with fresh, citrusy acids. Drink now–2016."
Chardonnay,"There's a reason this is one of the pricier white wines from the region. Aromas of yogurt and brie cheese are leveled by struck match, smoked grapefruit skins and sourdough. Vibrant lime pith and singed lemons fuel the palate, which further benefits from crushed oyster shell rockiness and goat cheese-like pungency. The mouth sings with remarkable acidity that will evolve. Drink 2018–2024."
Chardonnay,"Notes of poached pear, peach and spice lead to elegant, lightly creamy fruit flavors and a lemony finish. The concentration is light but what's there possesses a good sense of balance."
Chardonnay,"This is a soft style of Champagne, just hinting at the minerality often found in Chardonnays from the Côte des Blancs. It is ripe, with red apple and pear flavors, shot through with lime acidity. The aftertaste adds a more textured character."
Chardonnay,"Considered warm by Central Coast standards, Paso Robles is not always ideal for Chardonnay, but the veteran squad at Castoro did well on this nicely tight bottling. Key-lime pith and crisp Gala apple show on the nose, while solid acidity delivers flavors of rainy slate and squeezed citrus. There's good grippy tension to the sip as well."
Chardonnay,"This wine is aromatically expressive, with notes of apple juice and lees, seeming to show some oxygen exposure. It's full in feel, with sweet apple flavors on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Bright and refreshing acidity is the star of this lovely, windswept wine, powerful yet integrated in tannin and oak. The racy, feral notes of anise, apple blossom and nutmeg are complemented by a teasingly voluptuous spirit that never overwhelms."
Chardonnay,"This wine by winemaker Fintan du Fresne shows sea salt, apple blossom, cherimoya and tangerine rinds on the nose. Flavors are clean and pure, with dried apple, more sea salt, a bit of nectarine and orange spritz, offering a profile that could comfortably rest on the tongue all day long."
Chardonnay,"Offering none of the oaky, fruity richness of popular Chardonnays, this bottle needs to be figured out in a different way. It's super-dry, acidic and minerally, with citrus fruit flavors that seem barely touched by oak. It's a wine of structural integrity, made in the style of a great Chablis. One of the rare Chardonnays that should age."
Chardonnay,"Luscious, rich, balanced and intensely fruity, this stunning effort may well be the best Chardonnay ever produced in Washington. Two-thirds old- vine Celilo vineyard grapes are blended with estate-grown fruit from even older vines that were planted in 1976. Candied citrus, especially Meyer lemon, lemon verbena and other fruity herbs, stone fruits and subtle layers of caramel and toast burst from the glass. But the most amazing thing is that this wine stays fresh after being opened for literally days, much like a grand cru Burgundy."
Chardonnay,"They packed a lot of flavor into this rich Chardonnay for the price. It's toasty buttery and popcorny from winemaker treatment, with ripe fruit notes of pineapples and exotic tropical fruits. A brisk streak of minerals and acidity provides clean balance."
Chardonnay,"Crisp and light, this is tangy, chalky textured and with bright acidity. Citrus and green plum flavors proliferate in this attractive, ready-to-drink wine."
Chardonnay,"This is a basic, no-fuss Chardonnay with aromas of citrus and exotic fruit and a vibrant mouthfeel that is tangy and zesty throughout. There's a touch of spice on the close that helps keep the palate clean."
Chardonnay,"A rich nose of vanilla-bean ice cream, Marcona almond, buttered cornbread and pan-seared pear makes for a very inviting entry to this bottling. The vanilla and caramel flavors extend to the palate, but in a judiciously light way, with candied pecans, baked fruit and honeysuckle flavors, altogether quite delicious."
Chardonnay,"Hints of freshly pressed apples and pears in a darkly toasted oak barrel come through. Deft use of new French oak results in a full-bodied wine with a lush, buttered toast richness that highlights sweet apple and lemon flavors. The finish is clean and lemony with a slight saline touch."
Chardonnay,"Structured and minerally, this has citrus fruits that sit prominently over the tight acidity. A vanilla note is there to round the wine out. The crisp fruits and steely acids are intense and impressively balanced. Age for at least 5 years. Screwcap."
Chardonnay,"This medium-bodied white features balanced oak that manages to play off flavors of baked apple and butterscotch with compelling swathes of saltiness. This wine will work well with seafood as a result, and make for a decent match with midweek meals."
Chardonnay,"Crisp starfruit and citrus notes shine brightly throughout this refreshingly spry white. It's delicate in concentration but irresistibly quaffable, marked by a spray of salinity on the finish."
Chardonnay,"This is a very attractive, fruity and smooth wine in a plush style. Aromas of pear and pineapple turn to full flavors lightly spiced with vanilla. The texture is easy-going, mouthfilling and helps the flavors linger on the finish."
Chardonnay,"A dense vanilla-bean character coats a nose of seared white peach and toasted nuts. The palate features thick, ripe fruits, preserved lemon, a touch of walnut and a rocky grip."
Chardonnay,"Very strong and concentrated, with intense Key lime pie flavors, brightened with a squeeze of lemony acidity. Oak adds complex notes of buttered toast and vanilla. This powerful young Chardonnay will hold in the bottle for up to six years."
Chardonnay,"This wine is sourced from a handful of sites in the appellation, combining tropical, fleshy pineapple and vanilla with a lush texture and body. As it develops in the glass, its concentration is further accented in a taste of baked pear."
Chardonnay,"Another very nice Chardonnay from Durell. It's almost too oaky, with charred, buttered toast aromas and flavors dominating. But the underlying tropical fruit, orange cream and mineral flavors are fine, and so is the zesty acidity. The winemaker might want to lower the amount of new oak, or the level of toast, because the wine really doesn't need that much."
Chardonnay,"Firm and dry, with tart acids and minerals, this Chardonnay's fruit veers toward golden apricots and herbs. Not showing much richness now. Drink up."
Chardonnay,"A solid, all-purpose wine, this has some toast and vanilla components, along with straightforward fruit that hints at green apple. There's a little spice and butter in the aromas also."
Chardonnay,"Fleshy, melony scents kick it off. That set of aromas is followed by an acidic, lively palate with generic, slightly mealy flavors of peach, citrus and light oak. Long but a little bitter on the finish, but with good acid-driven zest."
Chardonnay,"The texture could be smoother on this Chardonnay, as it's all sharp knees and elbows. But it shows proper ripeness, with orange, green apple and tropical fruit flavors, as well as plenty of sweet vanilla, cream and buttered toast."
Chardonnay,"Aged in wood for 15 months, this wine shows ripe flavors more from fruit than toast. Apricot and Williams pear flavors are richly integrated with the light spice and the lemon crispness. The wine is ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"The aromas draw you in with complex notes of chamomile, almond butter, herb and citrus. The palate shows depth and vibrant texture, exhibiting poise and exquisite balance. It delivers."
Chardonnay,"Decadently rich in caramel and vanilla on the nose, this vineyard-designate evolves into more delicate floral elements, with a depth of spicy oak and baked apple and pear. Throughout the medium body and medium acidity is a freshness of lemon and lime, with a slight twist of tangerine."
Chardonnay,"This wine shows the hand of the winemaker in the buttered toast, vanilla, crème brulée, honey and creamy lees that dominate the palate. The underlying fruit is a little thin, suggesting tangerines and papayas. The price-quality ratio is fair."
Chardonnay,"Banana custard and charred marshmallow scents show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is similar, with charred brioche and cream pie flavors."
Chardonnay,"A full-bodied yet crisp Chardonnay, balanced with just a tiny hint of lingering ripeness. Fine for mid-week meals."
Chardonnay,"Star fruit and citrus notes build into riper peach and tree fruit flavors. A hint of powdered sugar colors the finish, as does a burst of buttered toast. Still integrating, this will reward further cellaring. Drink 2019–2030."
Chardonnay,"Sure it's oaky, but it's good oak, contributing complex aromas of burnt sugar, smoke and bacon fat to an otherwise straightforward peach-and-pear-flavored Chardonnay. The disparate elements converge in a harmonious finish that invites you back for another sip."
Chardonnay,"This wine is ripe, packed with tropical fruit and rich acidity. A hint of vanilla has rounded the wine out, giving a full body to the delicious fruitiness. Opulent and generous, it is kept in order by final, aromatic acidity. Drink from 2016."
Chardonnay,"This lightly aromatic wine conveys ripe red apple, pear, and star fruit. The fruit flavors are centered in a ball in the middle, offering plenty of appeal if not much complexity."
Chardonnay,"A good, dry Chardonnay that gets the job done at a fair price. Shows peaches and cream flavors with a bit of sharpness and green herbs on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Bright green apple and herb flavors and light to medium body make this non-oaky wine refreshing and lean in profile. It has appetizing acidity, a great sense of freshness and a lingering finish."
Chardonnay,"This Chardonnay hits all the right marks, as toasty oak influence is coupled seamlessly with ripe fruit tones and balancing acidity. Gorgeous scents of yellow apple, melon and honeysuckle transition through to the medium-weight palate, where they are met by attractive oak spice tones, a subtle tannic texture and refreshing acidic lift. The finish is long and evolving, and this should drink well through 2020."
Chardonnay,"An oxidative style of Chardonnay seems to match the old-vine character in this bottling that is a nutty yellow in color and shows crushed hazelnuts, dried lemon, sourdough and croissant on the nose. Lemon rinds, tangerine and walnut flavors appear on the sip, which is rich and nutty but not unctuous."
Chardonnay,"While most of this wine was fermented in French oak, a small percentage was held back in stainless steel. It finds a happy middle ground between creamy oak, even a touch of reduction, and a brightness of green apple and Jolly Rancher. It offers medium-bodied richness."
Chardonnay,"This stony, mineral wine is still way behind in its development. It is crisp and tight in texture, with refreshing acidity that lifts the white fruits with lime highlights. It's a full wine that will develop well. Drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,"Aromas of pear, citrus and almond should be familiar to anyone who knows Chilean Chardonnay, but to call this wine elevated or beyond regular would be a stretch. The palate is slightly lemony and green, and the finish has a persistent tang. Seems like basic Casablanca Chard to us."
Chardonnay,"A beautiful Chardonnay, solidly in the Gainey style of balance and integrity, but also showing the cool climate terroir of its origins as well as the excellence of the vintage. The result is this crisp, richly oaked but balanced young wine. It brims with tropical fruits and spices."
Chardonnay,"So soft, the wine is gently fruity, a hint of its chalk soil through a mineral edge. Fresh and tasting of lime and apple fruits, it is ready to drink now."
Chardonnay,"A ripe and creamy wine that has also managed to retain a strongly mineral character. It's a rich wine from the heart of Champagne's Côte des Blancs Chardonnay vineyards. Apples, spice and tight lime and lemon flavors give a crisp aftertaste. It is ready to drink."
Chardonnay,"This is crystal clear, fleshy and ripe, yet still graceful and refined. Mixed stone fruits are cut with yellow apple, the acids are natural and perfectly integrated. The wine was barrel fermented in a 50/50 mix of new and neutral, and there is just a hint of caramel in the extended finish."
Chardonnay,"Tart apple and lemon provide a zesty brightness and elegance in this straightforward wine, a celebration of minerality on the palate. Midway through, a taste of more developed stone fruit adds complexity and creaminess, with the wine finishing lean."
Chardonnay,"This wine is ripe with yellow fruits and apple acidity. The richness of the year is balanced by crispness, minerality and delicious fruitiness. It will age well, so drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,"You won't miss the presence of oak in this Chardonnay. It's brilliantly forward, ripe and savory, with orange, mango and lime flavors. Natural acidity and a creamy, leesy richness bring extra layers of appeal, and the finish is thoroughly dry."
Chardonnay,"Very dry, with mouth-watering acidity, but the palate also searches for a little more fruit than the wine offers. Still, the pineapples, peaches and apricots are pleasant enough."
Chardonnay,"This is a floral, mineral wine, both tight and exuberant in its perfumed character. Green apple and spices combine with the textured character of this balanced wine—lively, fruity and with fine acidity. It comes in a bottle that was common in the Victorian era, slightly narrower at the base."
Chardonnay,"Crisp and edgy, this is a ripe while crisp and cool wine. With bright acidity and tangy lemon zest, it's a still young and full of citrus fruits. The mineral, taut texture promises some good aging. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,"Light aromas of lime, apple peel and honeysuckle show on the nose of this bottling. The style leans toward the racy end of the spectrum, with lime-zest energy, chalky tension and a touch of red apple fruit."
Chardonnay,"Made in the sweet, simple way, with pineapple and orange jam fruit, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors. However, the price isn't bad, and it will appeal to a lot of your friends at parties for its California richness."
Chardonnay,"Carmel is the key player on the nose; it persists on the palate, where a hearty helping of zingy citrus flavors nicely balance the carmelly sweetness. Finishes with pear, citrus and toast."
Chardonnay,"Green, vegetal flavors mar this wine. While it's nicely dry and crisp in acidity, and offers modest green apple and mango flavors, the unripeness is hard to like."
Chardonnay,"There's no bones about the use of oak in this wine, which spent nine months enjoying the cradling effects of a good barrel, the majority French and 25% American. Ample fragrances of lemon and lime infuse the well-balanced wine that is also marked by crisp minerality, cinnamon toast and pear."
Chardonnay,"Made in the popular style, this Chardonnay has flavors of buttered toast, pineapple jam, vanilla and cinnamon spice. At the age of three-plus years, it's soft and mellow. Not likely to improve, so drink up."
Chardonnay,"As sweet and fruity as Gatorade, with a blast of caramelized oak. It's a Chard made in the popular style to appeal to the broad mass of consumers."
Chardonnay,"Hints of nuts add a savory tone to subtle apple flavors on this dry Chardonnay. Tart, crisp lemon and lime acidity on the midpalate makes it effortlessly refreshing, leading to a pleasant honey and floral note on the finish."
Chardonnay,"This is a soft wine, ripe with apricot and melon flavors. It shows the warmth of the vintage, round and gently fruity. Almonds and a tangy aftertaste give a crisp finish."
Chardonnay,"Toasty and oaky, with wood-grilled peach and roasted apple-skin aromas unfolding on the nose. Melon and pear flavors flesh out the medium-weight mouth, and linger alongside hints of sweet spice and charred wood on the close."
Chardonnay,"This is a best-of-barrels blend from different vineyard sites. It's a very good wine that grabs your attention with sheer Chardonnay dazzle. The tropical fruits are incredibly ripe and intense, with sweet, smoky oak adding supportive richness, brought into focus by crisp acidity. There's a core, like the nucleus of an atom, that holds everything together. Might even age for half a dozen years."
Chardonnay,"There's a measured richness on the nose of this impressive white, grown in the heart of the appellation's Westside Road neighborhood. Lemony salt and a touch of stone complement the integrated, present oak, rewarded by a complex texture and finish."
Chardonnay,"The winery's first release of the variety, this wine is sourced from several vineyards, including Sangiacomo Roberts Road in the Petaluma Gap and Sangiacomo Green Acres in Carneros. Orange-blossom aromas wrap around crisp apple and mango while the wine maintains medium weight and bright acidity, the toasted oak subtle."
Chardonnay,"All stainless-fermented, this clean and fruity wine has pleasant flavors of light peach and pear. It's round and forward, with balancing acidity."
Chardonnay,"Warm and ripe, this has fine honey and yellow fruit flavors. It has well-integrated acidity, with a touch of apple that lends a crisp finish."
Chardonnay,"This mature wine shows its toasty side. A mineral texture is now integrated with the almond, yeast and bread flavors to give a wine that's crisp while no longer bringing out its fruit. This wine is elegant with poise and great style. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"This vineyard is far better known for Pinot Noir, although Failla has excelled with its Chardonnay. Novy's 2010 isn't particularly like Chardonnay. Too floral. Could almost be Viognier. Yet it's a fine wine, crisp and rich in orange, lime and honeysuckle flavors."
Chardonnay,"Fairly mute on the nose, with an oily note and peachy aromas. Basic in the mouth, with good weight and balance along with oily flavors of peach and melon. Sweet and waxy on the finish, with the flavor of green banana."
Chardonnay,"Blended from eight different vineyards across the Columbia Valley, this wine displays aromatic nuances of toast and spice along with pear and peach. The restrained, medium-bodied flavors offer a mixture of citrus and stone fruit, with citrus winning out on the warm finish."
Chardonnay,"Alta Maria's appellation bottling is a bit leaner than the winery's single-vineyard bottlings, but quite elegant, with flint, pink grapefruit, mango and spearmint flavors, enhanced by a touch of oak."
Chardonnay,"Rich and ripe in tropical fruit, apricot and peach flavors, this oaky Chardonnay is brightened by crisp acidity. The oakiness returns in the finish, which suggests buttered toast. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"This refreshing wine comes from one of the Premier Cru sites on the north-facing bank of the Serein river. It's structured, tight and full of fine acidity and grapefruit and crisp apple flavors. Its texture and mineral character will allow it to age. Drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,"This Chardonnay has vanilla, lemon blossom and peach aromas. Lemon curd and green apple flavors come through on the palate before a pleasantly acidic finish."
Chardonnay,"Aromas of lychee, wet slate and just-cut kiwi combine for a tightly wound nose on this wine from one of the region's pioneering properties. The palate clings close to the lime, lemon and pink grapefruit pith flavors that open a little toward apple flesh and a pinch of herbs."
Chardonnay,"A tan color and dusty, tired aromas put this Chardonnay on short notice. Its plump palate delivers a mix of stone fruit and bitter, skin-based flavors, with a static finish."
Chardonnay,"There's a touch of sweetness around fruit flavors of apple, pear and melon. This has a forward, easy-drinking style, and that hint of honey finishes out with a streak of caramel."
Chardonnay,"Buttered toast, brown sugar, honey and orange jam mark this Chard's flavors. It has good acidity for balance. Drink up with umami-rich, salty foods, like ham and sausages."
Chardonnay,"Briny, sea foam aromas sit on top of papaya and corn on this oaky, resiny Chardonnay. Woody flavors are up front and immediate, with secondary flavors of clove and peach that end with sawdust."
Chardonnay,"This is not a showy wine, but the sense of reserve, good acidity, fresh flavors and good balance form an enjoyable picture that will be versatile with food."
Chardonnay,"Rounded and ripe, this has yellow fruits along with a fresher, sliced apple character. The wine is fruity, perfumed and just touched by a more mineral texture, with crisp acidity that gives a ripe fruitiness. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,"This reserve bottling takes the winery's basic 2011 Chardonnay and elevantes it with rich fruit and oak flavors. It's flamboyant in style with buttered toast, lemon custard, papaya and vanilla bean flavors, but balanced with good acidity."
Chardonnay,"Ripe apricot, mango and peach flavors mark this flashy Chardonnay. It's dry and oaky, with brisk acidity and a creamy mouthfeel. Don't drink it too cold."
Chardonnay,"Dry and crisp, with peach and citrus flavors and a touch of oak, this wine benefitted from a cool growing season in usually hot Paso Robles. It has the acidity of a true coastal white wine."
Chardonnay,This is a yeasty wine that shows a bitter almond character. It has an unattractive hard edge.
Chardonnay,"Always a joy to drink, the latest vintage of DDO's Arthur combines richness and elegance in a seamless and fascinating whole. Cucumber and melon, apple and pear fruit is the base, which expands into wet stone and mineral, then butter cookie. It's a one-wine seminar in how to make great Chardonnay, expressing the acid-driven elegance of Burgundy with some of the lushness of New World grapes. Tasted even better on the second day."
Chardonnay,"The acidity, dryness and minerality are all about the Sonoma Coast, but the wine is watery thin. Its orange, apricot, mango and oak flavors disappear into a quick finish."
Chardonnay,"Of medium build and seasoned in oak, this wine has a classic complement of baked apple and baking spice, providing a layered, ripe experience on the palate that finishes cleanly and simply."
Chardonnay,"Sultry pear and baked apple are the stars. Lemony and creamy on the palate, this offers slight hints of honey and tropical fruit. It boasts a long finish and robust yet restrained oak that should relax in time."
Chardonnay,"Fresh in mouthwatering minerality, this is positively bright, balanced and layered in lingering notes of lemon curd, green apple and just-picked vanilla bean. It is a gloriously delicate wine that's named for one of Marimar's beloved Springer Spaniels, made from one block planted to a selection of the See clone."
Chardonnay,"Sweet pea blossoms and fresh apples make this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay quite floral on the nose, but the palate is decidedly savory with a pleasantly creamy palate marked by brisk apple flavors, bright acidity and a smoked nut finish."
Chardonnay,"Light and bright, this fruity wine has a more bitter element that gives a sharper character that will hopefully round out. At the back, plenty of acidity leaves a crisp aftertaste."
Chardonnay,"Tangy and mineral, this is a crisp apple- and citrus-driven wine, full of fruitiness while also having a tight texture. Its acidity just adds to the generally ripe character of the wine. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"This wine is textured, with a firm backdrop to the ripe white fruits. Acidity cuts through everything, giving a fragrant character. Drink this developing wine from 2018."
Chardonnay,"The name of the top brand from the massive KWV winery refers to the cathedral-like roof of its main winery. This is a rich, generous wine, with spice, ripe fruit and a good layer of toasty wood flavors. There is complexity also, introduced by the crisp acidity that complements the opulent fruit. Best Buy."
Chardonnay,"Fermented entirely in stainless steel, Ocel is doughy and dark-golden in color, and despite its lack of barrel influence, the nose is ripe. On the palate, it finds its balance, showing off an abundance of apple and pear along with juicy acidity."
Chardonnay,"The statewide appellation reflects the fact that the grapes were sourced from Napa Carneros, Sonoma, Monterey and Santa Barbara. That makes it a master of the art of blending. Meanwhile, the great 2012 vintage, which was successful throughout the state, is responsible for the wine's balance. It's rich in tropical fruit, green apple, peach and nectarine flavors, with oak bringing richer elements of buttered toast and vanilla bean. With brisk acidity, it's a gorgeous, versatile Chardonnay to drink now, and the alcohol is a refreshingly low."
Chardonnay,"Very soft and dull, it offers white fruits and some acidity. Drink now."
Chardonnay,"A slightly darker shade of yellow, this wine from a historic vineyard offers preserved lemon, toasted almond and a doughy character on the nose. It's very tactile on the palate, clinging to the tongue strongly, showing flavors of stone fruit, mandarin pith and underripe tangerine juice."
Chardonnay,This wine comes from 35-year-old vines at French Creek Vineyard. Light aromas of spice and cream lead to a creamy palate marked with lighter-styled apple and stone-fruit flavors. It's a very pretty expression of the variety.
Chardonnay,"Vanilla toast and a compelling yeasty character on the nose entice. It's a little brighter on the palate, offering a balanced combination of minerality, acid and cream that lingers."
Chardonnay,"Abeja's Chardonnays are as certain to hit their target as a Kobe Bryant slam dunk, and the style remains consistent vintage after vintage. Spicy, nutty, based around stone fruits and melon, they do not shy away from the toasty flavors that derive from barrel fermentation in 40% new French oak. The underlying minerality and well-balanced acidity mark this as Washington fruit, most of it from the outstanding Conner Lee vineyard."
Chardonnay,"What a nice wine for this price. It's so dry and crisp and minerally and easy to drink, with enough sophistication to satisfy even fussy wine snobs. The subtle flavors include lemons, limes and smoky oak."
Chardonnay,"A delicious, ripe Chardonnay, fermented in stainless steel, and keeping all the freshness of the fruit. White currant flavors, flowers and subtle aromas give this wine elegance and great drinking pleasure."
Chardonnay,"A beautiful wine to pair with desserts based on white fruits or simple but delicious vanilla sponge cake. Made from late-harvested Chardonnay, it's very sweet in apricots, lemons, vanilla and buttered toast, with a brisk edge of acidity for balance."
Chardonnay,"This fresh but spicy Chardonnay starts with tropical fruit, citrus and floral aromas leading into a great fruit and acid balance. The minerality keeps the wine fresh and lifted, giving it a food-friendly edge. A great go-to white."
Chardonnay,"This wine shows the acidity of its cool Central Coast appellation, with ripe, long hang-time flavors of tropical fruit, apricot and peach, along with plenty of toasty oak notes. You'll want to drink this wine with rich fare, like complex scallop and shrimp dishes."
Chardonnay,"There is an oaky toastiness to the nose of this bottling, which shows light browned butter, honeysuckle and struck match aromas. Its barrel ageing shows prominently on the palate, brightened by lemon peel-like acidity and a finish that combines butter with tang. Toasted croissant notes fill out the midpalate."
Chardonnay,An aroma like canned fruit and rather lean flavors make this a basic wine with a narrow profile.
Chardonnay,"Made in an easy-going style, this Chardonnay has ripe, forward flavors of orange jam, buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Fine acidity provides balance."
Chardonnay,"Peach pit, matchstick and almond skin aromas come across a bit harsh. This is chunky on the palate, with pulpy, pithy melon and lees flavors that take on a briny characteristic on the finish."
Chardonnay,"Round, melony and driven by aromas of pears and apples, this internationally styled wine should strike a chord among casual Chardonnay quaffers. It's kind of sweet, a little bit fat, and it finishes smooth. True to the blueprint in many ways; think California and this will complete the picture. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits."
Chardonnay,Aromas of cream and corn on the cob are followed by lively full-bodied fruit flavors with plenty of toasty accents. It offers an appealing sense of texture along with a lovely sense of balance.
Chardonnay,"Medium bodied and restrained on the palate, this wine offers a mix of caramelized lemon and Gravenstein apple. It ends lengthy with tastes of ginger and lemongrass that leave a refreshing finish."
Chardonnay,"Golden orange in color, this wine shows honey, apple and pineapple, veering into a lushness of tropical proportion. Pronounced oak provides additional heft and the perception of sweetness."
Chardonnay,"There is a lot of fruit in the aroma and flavor of this wine. That, along with a touch of floral influence, make this medium-bodied wine fresh and alluring. Notes like Anjou pear, jasmine, ripe peach and a hint of vanilla swirl softly around the palate."
Chardonnay,"The softness of the 1999 vintage is very apparent in this approachable wine. It is full, round, only just touched by minerality, white fruits and some almonds giving weight and character."
Chardonnay,"Dark gold in color and intensely cradled in oak, this wine maintains a balance of complex, well-defined flavors of honey and apple, with lurking minerality that keeps it fresh and lively. It's lush and yet layered, a complete package. Drink now through 2020."
Chardonnay,"This wine is soft, indistinct at this stage. It needs to develop more of the fruitiness that is behind the bland exterior. The aftertaste has good freshness."
Chardonnay,"Maldonado is set in a fairly cool area of the Napa Valley, almost as far south as one can go. This resulting wine reflects that tension of minerality and crisp mouthfeel while providing a decadence of spiced apple and lime. Light and sublimely textured, it's subtle and sophisticated."
Chardonnay,"On the lean side of the flavor spectrum, this nonetheless has an appetizing lemon and butter character. It smells like green apples and mandarin oranges with an earthy edge, tastes like a light lemon-custard and has texture just rich enough to stay interesting."
Chardonnay,"Pleasant melon and pear aromas show sea-spray notes as the wine breathes. The palate is fresh and coastal in feel, with green melon and tropical fruit flavors that finish a touch salty."
Chardonnay,"Aged in a mixture of French oak (32% new) and stainless steel, it shows the best of both with fresh peach notes and barrel spices intermingling with crème fraîche. It's creamy in feel with the concentration winnowing slightly toward the finish."
Chardonnay,"This starts off a bit funky, with struck match aromas partially obscuring apple and citrus fruit. Yet it's full and custardy in feel, with hints of fruit showing through and a long, harmonious finish, so there's optimism for its future development. Drink now–2020."
Chardonnay,"As a Corton-Charlemagne should be, this is big and opulent. The minerality is quite present, a fresh addition to a wine that has more to do with ripe, racy tropical and yellow fruits that fill the mouth. It is not a wine for aging, maybe 2–3 years, but is certainly delicious now."
Merlot,"With its deep garnet color and aromas of blackberry, black cherry and coffee, this wine signals early on that you are in for something special. Flavors of black cherry, blueberry, anise and caramel play across the palate amidst fine tannins, right through the bright orange-peel finish."
Merlot,"Sanguine in cranberry while offering a velvety smooth, rounded approachability, this well-made, robust wine will appeal to a wide range of palates, expressing a big, leathery backbone of tannin and toasted oak."
Merlot,"This impressive, pure Merlot offers plenty of grip and concentration. Black-cherry fruit and dark chocolate, espresso and fine-grained tannins are all in play. The structure, length and polish make this a standout, especially at this price."
Merlot,Minty oaky aromas of baking spices share space on the nose with earthy black plum and berry notes. This feels tannic and resiny while the oaky spicy berry flavors finish with force and drying tannins.
Merlot,"Deep in color, with raisiny, fully ripe and heavy aromas. Feels tannic, extracted and rubbery, but amid the weight and bite there's black plum, pepper and coffee flavors. Finishes with drawing tannins and a dark wave of toasty flavor. A big wine with mouthfeel issues."
Merlot,"Boysenberry, cracked peppercorn and caramel frame the nose of this rich red. Although not particularly complex, lush flavors of berry juice and espresso on the palate prove rather tasty and enjoyable."
Merlot,"Tastes like the wine equivalent of blackberry and cherry jam. It's extracted, ripe and fruity, with a hit of citrusy acidity. Oak adds the usual notes of sweet buttered toast. Lots of people will like it at this price."
Merlot,"Leafy, slightly damp aromas include notes of spiced plum and herbs. On the palate, this is fairly stocky and chewy. A mixture of berry, spice and peppery flavors finishes with perceptible spicy oak."
Merlot,"Baked, raisiny aromas indicate a very ripe wine. This feels full and heavy on the tongue, with dark, toasty flavors that turn bitter, oaky and peppery on the finish."
Merlot,"Semi-sweet and tasting like cherry-flavored cough medicine, this Merlot leaves a lot to be desired. But it's serviceable."
Merlot,"Plum and cola aromas set up a spunky, rubbery Merlot that features a mix of roasted berry and chocolaty oak flavors. It is mild on the finish."
Merlot,"Here's a Merlot that presents simple but slightly muddled aromas of spice and fruit. The distinction between its various aromatic elements is not that clear, and the wine delivers a one-dimensional feel on the close."
Merlot,"This wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with green herbs along with plum and reductive notes. It's full bodied in feel with scratchy tannins."
Merlot,"The black-cherry fruit on the nose of this wine is a little sour, lifted by coffee grinds and incense. The tip of the sip is ripe with blueberry, then hardens around stiff tannins and zingy acidity, finishing on smoke and crushed herbs."
Merlot,"With its sugary, baked blackberry fruit, this Merlot is simply too soft and sweet, especially at this price."
Merlot,"There's lots of rich, jammy blackberry, cherry and oak flavor in this Merlot, with a gentle scour of firm tannins. It's not an ager, but offers plenty of upfront pleasure for drinking now."
Merlot,"Aromas of vanilla, clove, coffee and dark raspberry lead to a mouthful of rich layered fruit flavors. It shows impressive concentration, with fruit flavors lingering on the long finish."
Merlot,"A common, rustic Merlot. While it shows plenty of jammy cherry and blackberry fruit, it's tannins are jagged, and finishes soft."
Merlot,"Tomato, chili pepper, saucy notes and roasted berry and plum aromas give this a traditional nose. The body is rich and round, with an extra layer or two of structure and tannins. Flavors of baked, stewed berry fruits and herbs provide a salsa-like component, while dryness and herbal flavors drive the finish."
Merlot,"This wine is overwhelmingly smoky in char and bacon flavor, with a side note of herbal mint. Extracted, the oak is intrusive."
Merlot,"This 100% Merlot opens with delicate aromas of black currant, tilled earth and a whiff of vanilla. The ripe palate offers black-skinned berries, pipe tobacco and hints of toast alongside assertive tannins. Drink through 2020."
Merlot,"This 100% varietal wine is brawny and blustery in style: big boned with a lot of heat. Sturdy tannins surround extracted black fruit and shards of cinnamon, with fresh tobacco taking root on the finish."
Merlot,"A strong contender for the best $22 Merlot in the country. Sculpted, dense and deeply layered, it's loaded with mixed blue and black fruits, fresh herb and sweet toast. The use of new oak is restrained and appropriate, extending the finish with nicely applied streaks of coffee around ripe, tight, dry tannins."
Merlot,"Dark, fresh and somewhat sour red-fruit aromas meet with cedar on the nose of this bottling. The palate is juicy with red plums and strawberries at first, then shows more of a pine-needle edge. The tannins are a bit chunky and chewy, though, but may smooth out with time."
Merlot,"In the blend of this intensely fragrant young wine is 14% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot. I like the complexity, the way the primary fruits mix in unusual notes of pineapple along with the black cherry. It's resonant and tangy, with good, long flavors and lots of new oak. This was a year of winemaker transition, and may be the last of the real chocolaty wines from Northstar. Give this plenty of airing, or cellar it for another 3–4 years."
Merlot,"Heaps of blueberry, blackberry and mocha flavors make up the palate of this dry, soft Merlot. A few drops of Petite Sirah, Malbec and Petit Verdot add layers of flavor and texture."
Merlot,"This Merlot includes 13% Syrah, along with smaller amounts of Petit Verdot and Cabernet. Vanilla and tobacco scents open the door to a sharp, peppery wine, with flavors cloaked in bark and scorched earth. It's rustic, big and flavorful, with a fat, meaty finish. This is the wine to go with your tri-tip."
Merlot,"This expression of Merlot is soft and plush, and it offers layers of cherry, raspberry and soft spice. Oak-derived aromas of toasted almond and clove are delicate and well integrated."
Merlot,"Though labeled Columbia Valley, this is in fact 100% Merlot from the estate vineyards on Red Mountain. It's chewy and tannic, as is often the case with Red Mountain reds, with black cherry and cassis fruit wrapped by astringent tannins hinting at dark chocolate. In short, a fine steak wine, that needs some fat to cut the tannins."
Merlot,"This wine combines green, herbal overtones with puckering, bitter tannins, a unsavory mix that doesn't please the palate."
Merlot,"A 100% varietal wine, grown in an area called the Lower Mountaintop, this offers a compelling candied cherry and raspberry element, supported by complex accents of vanilla and cured meat. With plenty of body to stay fresh and vibrant on the palate, it never gets bogged down, finishing in richer components of dark chocolate and oak."
Merlot,"Dry, tough in tannins and acidic, this Merlot isn't offering much now. Despite a rich, concentrated vein of cherries, it's a hard, almost old-fashioned wine. Your best bet is to age it, but no guarantees. Try after 2012."
Merlot,"The legend behind Pàtrimo is that the folks at Feudi di San Gregorio had misidentified the grape variety planted in their historic vineyard until it was finally confirmed to be Merlot. Very few vineyards with international varieties exist in this part of the world. This is a beautifully elegant but large expression with precise aromas of blackberry, spice, chocolate and maraschino cherry. The gorgeous 2007 vintage shows tannins that could still age in the cellar and a slightly sweet or chewy finish."
Merlot,"Dry, spicy red-fruit aromas are solid and standard, while the palate is lean but comfortable, with dry, simple cherry flavors accented by a spot of oak-driven vanilla. Good but as regular as they come. Easy to drink."
Merlot,"This is made in a delicate, acidic and bone dry style. Some will say it lacks richness—and it does, by Napa standards. But it's quite an elegant wine, silky and light, with a hint of blackberry and tobacco flavor."
Merlot,"Rich and structured, this shows the plushness of today's Bordeaux Merlot. Ripe berry fruits, dark plums and a touch of vanilla give spice and round off the texture. It's juicy, still developing and best from 2016."
Merlot,"This has aromas of prunes and burnt rubber, but it tastes better than that. It's a pretty raw effort."
Merlot,"Fruit was picked later than normal and the Masseto Merlot does indeed show mature aromas of black cherry, ripe blackberry, earthy iron and polished stone. The intensity and purity are amazing and the wine is sophisticated, soft and very rich on the finish. It is already showing beautiful evolution in the glass."
Merlot,"Dry, with smooth tannins and plenty of elegance, this has interesting black-cherry, cola and cedar flavors. It's not likely to improve with age, so drink up."
Merlot,"Made in a relatively light-bodied, soft style, this wine has a weedy, herbal element at its heart, and could use more fruit to balance out. It ends in a taste of bittersweet chocolate and espresso."
Merlot,"A simple Merlot that's priced fairly and is a little tannic at first, the fruit acting shy, but that opens into a fine Merlot that would go well with rich red meat. ."
Merlot,"Black cherry fruits sink even deeper into blackberry jam on this nose, which is leveled by vanilla and black licorice. It's chunky and sticky once sipped, with blueberry juice and chocolate-chip elements that are cut with anise-like herbs. Espresso shows on the finish, which is slightly sour and bitter."
Merlot,"Soft and sweet in Porty cherry, chocolate and raisin flavors, with a burn from high alcohol."
Merlot,"Surprising scents of clover and mint rise up from the glass, leading into a round, fruity, substantial wine with good cherry fruit and some earthy tannins from the 5% Cabernet Franc in the blend. The wine has not completely knit together, but a good steak could fix that."
Merlot,"Strong cinnamon and mocha scents illuminate this wine, and the fruit shows some pretty cherry qualities. A bit of dill creeps in too, showing the effect of this cooler vintage on a cooler site. —P.G."
Merlot,"Jean Lissague, one of Bordeaux wine's “new generation,” produced the 100% Merlot with spice and firm tannins. It also has weight and richness from the generous fruitiness. Drink this structured wine starting from 2019."
Merlot,"This budget wine has sweet fruit and soft tannins, along with surprising concentration and length. Offsetting a hint of stemminess are generous, varietally true flavors, and a rich, meaty nose that suggests beef and coffee. Best Buy. —P.G."
Merlot,"Draws you in with its brilliant ruby color and assertive bouquet of dark plum, black cherry and berry nuanced with menthol and dirt. A full, round mouthfeel and soft, fleeting tannins showcase the wine's solid balance, and the strong finish is not sweet or overdone."
Merlot,"Although it's just a guess, it seems clear that Snoqualmie was the loser in 2004, when so many small wineries were helped out by Chateau Ste. Michelle, which provided them grapes during a bad freeze year. Snoqualmie probably should not have made a reserve under the circumstances, as this falls well short of recent efforts. It's a light and simple wine, with thin candy cherry flavors and herbal streaks."
Merlot,"Crushed peppercorn, black plum, leather, dried violet, game and cedar touches show on the nose of this bottling from Ryan Roark. Sandalwood and pine notes emerge on the palate, accenting its black pepper-laced cranberry fruit. A vibrant and chillable red wine for summer."
Merlot,"Black in color, with sweet, full-force aromas of cola and black fruits. There's staunch acidity on the palate, something that will barely be noticed if drunk with food. Meanwhile, the flavors are flashy but smooth, with a play toward coffee, blackberry, chocolate and herbs. Dense and deep; very nice Merlot."
Merlot,"Aromas of sweet red berries, dried fruits and herbs open this light, accessible wine from Israel. The tone of the fruit seems to shift between a tart rhubarb and a slightly candied quality. Cherry notes show on the lean and dry back end."
Merlot,"On the big and bold side, this has abundant fruit flavors surrounded by equally abundant lip-smacking tannins, great acidity and a long finish. Not very oaky, it has a vibrancy and fruit focus that is mouthwatering and compelling. It's tasty now, but will also improve through 2017."
Merlot,"Rich and appealing, this feels classy, with smooth tannins framing cherry and licorice flavors."
Merlot,"Credit this Merlot for sheer enjoyability. It defines Merlot as the soft, drink-me-now Bordeaux red wine, full-bodied yet instantly likeable. Made from 100% Merlot, it's extraordinairly rich in cherry fruit, while 100% new French oak adds a deft touch of buttered toast. The tannins are gentle, sweet and complex. This flashy, fleshy wine is great now, and will hold and evolve in the bottle for at least six years."
Merlot,"The browning rim, light tannins and fair acidity make this a wine for drinking now. The notes of earth, spiced plum, toast and sweet, stewed rhubarb are complimented throughout with vanilla and cinnamon."
Merlot,"Rapidly maturing, with some brick coloring and secondary fruit flavors of prune and raisin. Drinking nicely, and quite delicious. Along with the smooth fruit you get smoke, dust, cocoa and a hint of caramelized sugar."
Merlot,"This soft, supple and seductive Merlot (with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend) is both earthy and sensuous. The mouthfeel is like smooth felt. Black cherry, blackberry and a dash of cola fill the mouth, with lush tannins and a long finish. There's just a hint of brown sugar as it wraps up."
Merlot,"A hearty addition of 19% Malbec and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon contribute to this wine's complexity and soft, round profile of hearty tannin and oak. It offers well-defined flavors of salty leather, plum and dark chocolate."
Merlot,"A really nice Merlot, and look at that price. It's dry, elegant and entirely balanced, with a rich earthy texture. Shows classic flavors of black cherries, black currants, violets, anise and sweet sandalwood. Terrific value."
Merlot,"The variety is hard to find on this wine with aromas of tire rubber, barrel spice, green pepper and herb in the lead. It's medium bodied in feel, with soft tannins."
Merlot,"Penetrating aromatically, spicy and complex, this brings in sharp berry scents, baking chocolate and a streak of herb. It's tight and vertically structured, and once in the mouth it turns a bit hard and unyielding. But it lingers and resonates, improves after being open for several hours, and can be cellared for up to a decade."
Merlot,"Drink this charming Merlot now for its soft, sweet richness of fruit. With a touch of smoky oak, it shows cherry, red currant and mocha flavors that are wrapped into polished tannins."
Merlot,"Made with organically grown grapes, Pizzolato's ruby-colored Merlot starts off easily enough with focused aromas of wild berries, wet earth and spice. The wine's appearance is thin and simple, and so is the mouthfeel."
Merlot,"Very young, this is a fine follow-up to the winery's outstanding 2009. Dark and rich, the estate-grown fruit offers far more flavor than almost any domestic Merlot in this price range. Blackberries, black cherry, smoke and espresso lead into a grainy, chocolaty, tannic finish."
Merlot,"Made at an attractive price point, this wine delivers value and plenty of flavor, from blackberry jam to oak and black pepper. It's sturdy and structured, ready for the table or larger gathering."
Merlot,"This French-Australian collaboration has turned out a soft, easy-to-drink Merlot with notable complexity. Cassis and black cherry fruit is backed by shadings of cedar and vanilla and eased along by a creamy texture and supple tannins. Without any track record, it's probably prudent to drink this over the next few years."
Merlot,"Still rather harsh, this is a rustic wine with cherry, cola and prune flavors. It's not for aging."
Merlot,"A tight Merlot, dry and tart, with cherry, tobacco and red currant flavors. A little coarse in texture, but the richness is just fine."
Merlot,"Made in a balanced and graceful style, this light-bodied red comes from vineyards in both Oak Knoll and Oakville. Tart cherry, plum and coconut shavings are supported by light oak and firm tannins. The finish is complex and spicy."
Merlot,"There's lots of flavor going on here for a modest price. It starts with sharp, well-defined red fruit, tight and acidic, but interesting and nuanced. There's a pretty fair streak of vanilla, which suggests some sort of oak chip treatment, but it fills out the middle and delivers the sort of flavors that many consumers will love."
Merlot,"This excellent Merlot speaks to many of Reininger's proven strengths. It's quite smooth and supple, loaded with ripe plum and cherry fruit, seamless and chocolaty. The balance is right on, the length and texture captivating."
Merlot,"Lots of sweet-smelling new-oak flavor permeates this dry, medium-bodied and moderately tannic wine. Aromas suggest toasted French bread and the flavors blend chocolate and cherries."
Merlot,"The aromas of coffee, red currant and red plum are bright and effusive, with tar and cough medicine notes in the background. The cherry flavors are plush and full, with coffee notes lingering on the finish."
Merlot,"Merlot has never been Bell's strong point, and while this is a pretty good one, it's a little rough and sandpapery in the mouth. It has currant, blackberry, tobacco and green tea flavors, and is fully dry. Blended with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, it wants to be opened soon."
Merlot,"Although this is currently aggressively oaky, this full, fleshy Merlot is on the path to excellence. Bright berry and plum flavors are kissed with notes of vanilla, cinnamon and toast, plus a hint of herb."
Merlot,"Minty berry aromas settle well and hold up to airing. This everyday Merlot is more than competent on the palate. Berry and spice flavors finish chewy, with standard ripeness and follow through."
Merlot,"The fruit here is certainly more ripe and powerful than in the winery's regular bottlings. But it is offset by rugged tannins, and an earthiness that borders on rusticity. —P.G."
Merlot,"A very rich, almost Port-like ripeness and dense black fruits give this wine powerful presence. It has weight and sweet fruitiness that is happily cut with acidity. Tannins provide a light reminder of the chance to age this wine. Drink now and until 2019."
Merlot,Barrel aromas of vanilla and coconut are followed by fruit-forward cranberry and raspberry flavors and a vanilla-filled finish. The oak plays prominently.
Merlot,"Soupy tomato, plum and green tobacco aromas feed into a pinched biting rubbery palate. This Merlot tastes roasted and oaky, with baked plum and berry flavors matched by clove and chocolate notes. A drawing tannic finish tastes stewy and woody."
Merlot,"Cocoa, toast, vanilla, cigar box, coconut and raspberry aromas lead the way on this 100% varietal wine. The palate is full of dark fruit flavors with slightly gritty tannins and tart acids. Give it some time to come together."
Merlot,"This is an almost picture-perfect example of an excellent Washington Merlot, loaded with rich fruit flavors of plum and black cherry. The mouthfeel is satiny, the tannins round and ripe, with a smooth and supple finish."
Merlot,Aromas of black berry and black cherry lead to flavors of cherry vanilla and red plum before a soft tannic finish.
Merlot,"This wine is in keeping with the producer's goals of making restrained, balanced wines. It is both those things, characterized by firm, tight tannins and muted sage, the texture narrowly defined."
Merlot,"Named for the producer's French grandfather, who loved Merlot, this 100% varietal wine from a high-elevation site is leathery, meaty and quite debonair. With a scent of bacon grease giving a sense of rustic deliciousness, it's also soft and unctuous on the palate, medium to full bodied."
Merlot,"Chandler Reach grew the grapes for this big, chewy, rather blocky Merlot. It offers pleasant red fruits and light chocolaty barrel notes."
Merlot,"Strawberry fruit is set against some pretty stiff tannins; it seems to have over-reached in color and extract, given the rather lean fruit. Leafy, herbal and a bit off-kilter."
Merlot,"Fleshy, sun-kissed black plums and cherries abound in this supple, velvet-textured Merlot. It's mouthfilling and rich, but brisk cranberry acidity lends firm structure. The palate is subtly nuanced, marked by soft tannins and layers of brambly wood, cedar and baking spice. Aged 19 months with a large proportion of new French oak, it drinks well now but should meld beautifully from 2020–2028."
Merlot,"Rubbery, tarry, herbal berry aromas lead to a fresh, lean, somewhat acidic palate. Flavors of plum, red currant and green herbs finish with zest and juicy acidity."
Merlot,"Fruit comes from three places for this wine, Bennett Valley, Alexander Valley and Knights Valley, exhibiting some good blending skill in the cellar. Red currant, clove, cedar and pencil all appear around a full-bodied, leathery texture and dots of black pepper and sage."
Merlot,"This 100% varietal wine offers predominant aromas of wood spice along with herb and dark fruit. The palate is medium bodied, showing a mixture of fruit and barrel."
Merlot,"Chalky tannin surrounds succulent baked plum and dark cherry, with chocolate and black licorice riding along in the back seat. This is a full-bodied, ripe wine."
Merlot,"Rich in plum, black cherry and blackberry, this wine is subtle in cinnamon and dried herb, with additional embellishments of leather and earth. Soft and subdued, it's approachable and versatile."
Merlot,"The aromas are bright, with raspberry, licorice, green pepper and medicinal notes. The flavors are lighter in style and show a distinct green tinge that provides some distraction."
Merlot,The aromas of herbs and jammy fruit are light while the palate offers plush-feeling cocoa and berry flavors. This offers a lot of enjoyment for the price.
Merlot,"Fresh and colorful, with black cherry, cassis, sweet oak and coffee aromas. Feels big and grabby, with big tannins supporting blackberry and olive flavors. Sort of a rough ride but generous with the baked flavors and fruit content."
Merlot,"You get plenty of rich, ripe cherry, red currant, cappuccino and peppery spice flavors in this briskly tannic, dry young Merlot. The mouthfeel is a little rugged, though. Drink up."
Merlot,"The immediate impression you get is of strong menthol aromas, followed long after by supporting fruit flavors of blackberry and cherry. The minty sensation also carries through to the mouth, but a touch of fruitcake spice adds something different to the finish. Smooth and approachable now."
Merlot,"The toast, freshly ground coffee, dark chocolate and cherry aromas pop. Plum and chocolate flavors are smooth in feel and linger on the finish."
Merlot,"Aromas of brick dust, sweet spice, rubber and leather are good if you're not seeking saturated berry fruit, while the palate is starchy and grabby, with flavors of stewed berry, tomato, leather and earth. Raspberry is detectable on the thin finish, but so is a soupy flavor. Decent wine with some faults."
Merlot,"Brambly blackberry and leathery tar make for a full-bodied atmosphere around what is actually a fairly light, integrated and smooth wine. Clove and black currant give the finish a spicy edge."
Merlot,"Dark, sappy and reductive, it shows skillful winemaking and sensitivity to vineyard management. The color is there, the aromas are pure and the flavors are balanced, without being overripe. It captures a pleasing mix of berries and currants. Tannins are quite dry and lightly peppery."
Merlot,"The winery's first varietal Merlot is a blend of fruit from the Canoe Ridge, Stone Tree and Cold Creek vineyards. The aromas are locked up at present with notes of dark fruit, crushed flowers and spice that lead to ripe, plush fruit flavors backed by a firm spine of tannins that need time to unwind. It's the most unabashedly forward wine this winery has made to date. Give it plenty of time to open up; it delivers."
Merlot,"Le Redini is predominantly Merlot, with a small component of Alicante. It opens with notes of bright cherry, leather, tobacco and spice. It shows bold roundness and soft berry nuances on the finish. It's a well-made and elegant wine with an easygoing personality."
Merlot,"Black berry and plum aromas keep greener notes from dominating the bouquet, along with accents of stale burnt coffee that lingers in the back. The medium-weight mouth is juicy and driven by more dark fruit flavors with a hints of olive. Soft, round and easy to drink."
Merlot,"There's a slightly sour, forest-floor funkiness to the nose of this wine from an historic appellation near Hollister. Not boasting much ripe fruit on the palate, the flavors lean toward leather and earth, with fine tannins, nice acidity and hints of licorice."
Merlot,"One of the producer's signature wines, in a region becoming well-known for the variety, this elegant, herbal-tinged wine does not part with the Napa Valley's imprint of boldness in its length and breadth of rich red fruit, clove, vanilla and toasted oak."
Merlot,"Rusty in color for a young wine, with mulchy, faded berry fruit aromas. It has life on the palate, which tastes earthy, peppery and a little bit burnt. A dry, spicy wine with cherry flavors interspersed."
Merlot,"The winemaker really squeezed out the cherries and boysenberries in this Merlot, making it super fruity. It's not especially complex, but it will appeal to fans of jammy wines."
Merlot,"This leafy, Bordeaux-style Merlot is applealing for its moderate approach and emphasis on herbs and spice over oak and extraction. The wine is smooth and and round, with berry, cassis and herbal offsets. Classic Merlot from Chile, with just enough oak and fruit to rank as modern."
Merlot,"This bright Riserva Merlot offers chewy cherry flavors followed by elegant notes of spice, tar and cola. The mouthfeel is rich and velvety. Pair this ruby-colored wine with duck confit seasoned with ginger and orange."
Merlot,"What a pretty wine. Made for drinking soon, it shows impeccable balance in the finely ground tannins, moderate alcohol and deft touch of oak. Feels soft and complex in the mouth, carrying flavors of berries, herbs, mocha and sandalwood. Easy to find, with 16,056 cases produced."
Merlot,"A good honest Merlot, with vanilla, spice cake and woodsy scents followed by cherry pie flavors and a medium finish of ash and green pepper. This is a subtle and restrained wine that should appeal to fans of Bordeaux. Drink now."
Merlot,"This Merlot is soft, simple and seemingly sweet in fruit and oak. With ripe cherry, mocha and spice flavors, it will partner well with a cheeseburger."
Merlot,"This delicious wine is as soft, silky and supple as can be. The fruit is slathered in spicy, chocolaty oak, which lends some sharpness to the edges. Red berries and red licorice lead into finishing flavors of baking chocolate. But as tasty as it is when first opened, it fades quickly, suggesting that this is one to drink up rather than lay down."
Merlot,"This is a limited production wine—a rich and firmly tannic. It has weight and density, backed plum skin and blackberry notes. It's all wrapped in a concentrated, structured package. Age for at least 4 years."
Merlot,"Montes tosses quite a few qualifiers at the name of this wine; i.e. “special cuvée” and “reserve,” but at the end of the day it's a basic Merlot with earthy notes and some obvious oak. The fruit flavors veer toward plum and blackberry, while below that there's a shot of woodiness."
Merlot,"Pretty blueberry fruit highlights this clean, fresh, forward wine with genuine fruit character. Any rough edges have been softened by aging in neutral oak."
Merlot,"This acidity-driven wine has a sheer veneer of tannins over thinned red fruit, earth and cocoa powder. With such a light, simple touch, this wine is a good choice for those who usually order white wine."
Merlot,"The aromas are a bit unsettled, bringing a wilted-flower note that is off-putting. The ripe cherry, blackberry and smoky flavors seem disconnected. It doesn't all come together, and the variety seems impossible to find."
Merlot,"Aromas of this medium-bodied wine are smoky and herbal. The flavors combine black pepper, spicy oak notes and and almost-sweet fruits like plum and watermelon."
Merlot,"Summers has struggled with Merlot, but may be getting a handle on this difficult variety. The '06 is dry and soft, with fully ripe tannins framing appealing currant, cherry, licorice and spice flavors."
Merlot,"Merlot from Chile is coming up fast and this shows why. The aroma and flavor package is on target with plums, coffee and chocolate predominating. The bell pepper note on the nose is not overbearing. The superb balance and long finish wrap it up nicely."
Merlot,"Charming and straightforward, barnyard, charred meat and manure notes on the nose lead to a palate perfumed with mixed berry compote. Shows the faintest grip on the shortish finish. Try with baby lamb chops."
Merlot,"High-toned aromas of raspberries, mint, nori and green herbs are followed by black-tea flavors and slightly gritty-feeling tannins. It brings appeal but the variety seems hard to find."
Merlot,"Blended with 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this mountain-grown wine offers bold black plum and berry around a compacted, extracted fullness of tannin and French oak. Dried herb, clove and vanilla accent the fruit, while the finish lingers gingerly."
Merlot,"This high-end wine has a tenacious hold of earthiness, that exhibits as tomato leaf and dried herb. Full-bodied and densely concentrated, its tannins are smooth and fine, while the texture leans gravelly. Black pepper and leather characteristics are hard to ignore."
Merlot,"Fleshy and unctuous in flavor yet tautly structured, this neatly balanced Merlot offers loads of bright cherry and raspberry flavors layered into wisps of toast, spice and cedar. Its brisk puckery style makes it an ideal dinner wine. Fine-grained but persistent tannins on the finish suggest ageability well into the 2020s."
Merlot,"A structured wine from the Chadronnier family, it is full of tannins and also full of sweeping black-fruit flavors. It is perfumed, rich and concentrated. Don't drink until at least 2020 to get the full generosity of the wine."
Merlot,"A polished, elegant Merlot, with good structure framing deep flavors of currants, carob, violets and anise. The thick tannins suggest a good steak. Now through 2009."
Merlot,"Supple in juicy blackberry and plum, this light- to medium-bodied Merlot contains 10% Cabernet Franc and offers a mouthful of dry, dusty tannins before finishing in a punch of black peppery spice."
Merlot,"Incorporating a small amount of Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a floral Merlot, with notes of violet counterpointed by barbecue smokiness and earth. Big, rich tannins are dry and robust, veering on full bodied, before the acidity in the wine pulls things back into balance."
Merlot,"Quite tannic and oaky, this rough and chewy Merlot is constructed around a thin layer of cassis fruit. But the big flavors are the dark, earthy ones—raw wood and thick tannin."
Merlot,"This is a good bottle, single vineyard-sourced, toasty and still tightly-wound with tart red fruits. It's pretty and forward, perhaps best enjoyed in the next year or two."
Merlot,"Soft in texture and semi-sweet, this simple Merlot has sugary cherry and blackberry flavors."
Merlot,"Made in a restrained, elegant style, with modulated blackberry, currant and herb flavors balanced with oak. Dry, supple and polished, this young wine needs a year or two in the cellar to gain complexity."
Merlot,"Smooth and fruity, yet complex and complete, this excellent wine offers ample acid and polished tannins around pretty red fruits. Notes of citrus and spice, tobacco and toast linger through a satisfying finish."
Merlot,"This wine is slightly austere at the start, despite its fuller body and style. Leathery and dusty in tannin, the black and blue fruit remain elusive, teasing in between bouts of coffee and chocolate."
Merlot,"The entry is oaky and the fruit light; it seems a bit unbalanced. The fruit suggests pomegranate and very tart raspberry, with plenty of acid; the oak layers in thick flavors of espresso and chocolate. Tannins are stiff but not too rough; and the finish suggests that some American oak mayhave been used."
Merlot,"Raw, earthy plum aromas are spicy and lightly herbal. This feels saucy yet monotone. Tomato, red-plum and herbal flavors end with a hint of brown sugar and a continuation of the wine's herbal plum character."
Merlot,"A lovely Merlot and, at this price, a compelling buy. Hard to find a better inexpensive all-around full-bodied red than this one. Fully dry, it has polished flavors of cherries, currants, anise and pepper, wrapped in a gentle, silky texture."
Merlot,"A rustic Merlot. The cherry, cassis and chocolate fruit flavors are so powerful, they swamp the wine, leaving elegance behind and making it indelicate."
Merlot,"Exceptionally rich and sensual, this single-vineyard beauty has finely ground, dusty tannins. The fruit veers toward sour cherry candy, with a jacket of sweet, toasty oak. Drink now–2016."
Merlot,"A perfect wine from a classic vintage, the 2007 Masseto (100% Merlot from a 17-acre vineyard of the same name) opens with an unabashedly opulent bouquet of delicious blackberry, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, exotic spice and cinnamon. Masseto excels both in terms of quality of fruit and winemaking and delivers plush, velvety tannins and an extra long, supple finish. It will make a special and valuable collection to your cellar."
Merlot,"Gritty and rustic, with blackberry, prune and spice flavors. It's a dry, tannic wine, for drinking with simple foods, like burritos."
Merlot,"Sweet oak aromas, ripe fruit flavors and a firm texture make a complete and enjoyable package in this full-bodied wine. It has a toasted oak flavor, tasty plum and cinnamon nuances, good acidity and supportive tannins."
Merlot,"This bold wine has a very dark color and fresh, concentrated blackberry aromas. Generous berry and black pepper flavors seem to saturate the taste buds, leading to a lingering fruit and spice finish. The texture is almost viscous, as lots of fine tannins add grip. It's the rare wine with no added sulfites."
Merlot,"This wine from the Geneseo district offers aromas of sour plums and just enough cigar box to tempt the nose. The flavors are a bit flat at first, then the acidity and tension of sour cherries emerges in the midpalate, bolstered by some black licorice."
Merlot,"More floral and blueberry driven than Bousquet's regular Merlot from '07 but not discernibly better or worse. The palate is round and the balance and feel are good. Flavors of floral blueberry follow the bouquet, and the finish shows a dash of sweet berry syrup and chocolate."
Merlot,"Thick and chocolatey, this brawny wine is full bodied and richly concentrated. It is a mighty force of blackberry, blueberry and toasted oak."
Merlot,"Herbaceous and brambly on the nose and palate, Wölffer's Estate Merlot is concentrated in red plum and cherry fruit but lean in structure, with lively acidity and a softly tannic finish. It drinks well now, but it could benefit from decanting."
Merlot,"Rubbery and rhubarby on the nose, then confected and frankly sweet-tasting on the palate, with a short finish."
Merlot,"Blended with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Syrah, this medium-bodied, soft and juicy red offers notions of berry pie and dusty leather, as backbeats of chocolate and blackberry play on the palate. With an intensely lengthy finish marked by clove this wine is memorably inviting."
Merlot,"Candied but also peppery and herbal, and without much depth or complexity. The palate is tight, acidic, sheering and tastes of snappy, edgy cherry and raspberry fruit. Then an oaky, vanilla dryness sets in. Solid and fresh, but hardly a head-turner."
Merlot,"This wine seems overtaken with scents and flavors of tree tar and resin. The impression of pine resin cuts out the fruit, leaving some woody flavors in the finish."
Merlot,"Pronounced aromas of char, smoke and bramble lift with time and aeration, revealing prettier notes of fresh herb and red cherry. Plump cherry and berry flavors are supple and concentrated, but have a distinctly green, herbal tone on the midpalate. The finish is marked by a bite of fine-grained but delicately bitter tannins."
Merlot,"Aromas of savory herbs, mineral, exotic spice and red fruit are followed by fruit flavors that are surprisingly restrained considering the warmth of the vintage. Tart acidity livens it up. It's green for the variety but still brings enjoyment."
Merlot,"Soft and simple, with slightly sweet pie-filling flavors of cherries and mocha. A decent, everyday wine for picnics, barbecue and such."
Merlot,"Redolent of dried cherries and violets, granite and slate, this late-release Merlot is already dropping elegant hints of its maturity. Concentrated with crisp black cherry flavor, it balances lavish texture alongside brisk acidity and minerality. The finish is long and meandering. It's delicious now, but sure to improve further from 2020 on."
Merlot,"Spicy and still showing some youthful sharpness, this pure Merlot is loaded with penetrating raspberry fruit, juicy and tart. The mouth-cleaning acidity both sharpens the palate and intensifies the flavors, and leads into a finish dotted with super dark chocolate."
Merlot,"Light in color and style, this wine seems more similar to a Pinot Noir than a Merlot. There's no apparent oak influence to interfere with the notes of ash, red currant, saline and bell pepper that are supported by a light grip of tannins."
Merlot,"There's too much raisin flavor, and the wine is deficient in acidity, giving the cherry and blackberry flavors a syrupy feel."
Merlot,"Deeply saturated with blackberry and plum flavors, this powerful, boldly structured Merlot balances rich fruit with complex shades of earth and mineral. Umami-rich whiffs of soy sauce and hay linger from nose to finish, hinting towards its development. It's pleasant now, but should meld considerably through 2019."
Merlot,"This is a full-bodied big-shouldered wine blended with Malbec and Syrah, that's inky and dark. Grippy tenacious oak surrounds a mouthful of black olive, black plum and tobacco."
Merlot,"Doesn't have quite the concentration of many more expensive Merlots, but fills a nice niche in an affordable red wine that's full-bodied, dry and elegant. Offers pleasant flavors of cherries, red currants, cola and oak."
Merlot,"Sure, cedar and chocolate are the dominant aromas and flavors, but there's enough blueberry fruit to stand up to the oak rather nicely. It doesn't hurt that the oak is high-quality stuff either, as the elements blend together in a harmonious whole. A little oaky, but shows a degree of finesse not often found in Chilean wines at this level."
Merlot,"Toasty oak, oodles of sweet fruit, and supple tannins are hallmarks of superconsultant Michel Rolland, and he has managed to bring them to the masses in this gently constructed Merlot. Bing cherries and toast, with mocha and herb shadings, are brought together with a deft touch."
Merlot,"Dry, lean and sawdusted on the nose, with vanilla aromas blending with simple plum and berry notes. Whole on the palate, with a creamy, mildly tacky feel, while the flavors of red fruits are regular at best and smothered with butter and wood resin. Solid enough but probably too woody given the wine's weight and overall quality."
Merlot,"After an early blast of mint and menthol, the nose works its way toward solid berry, spice and vanilla flavors. The finish is round and moderately long, with no sharp angles or jagged edges. Good yet standard Merlot at a welcome price point."
Merlot,"The aromas bring notes of dried herb, vanilla bean, wood spice and black cherry. The flavors are rich and luscious, supported by plump ripe tannins. The finish lingers."
Merlot,"A simple Merlot, thin and dry, whose cherry and red plum flavors are compromised by green, unripe notes."
Merlot,"Tempting oaky aromas and flavors in this full-bodied and tannic wine run the gamut from clove to nutmeg to cinnamon and wood smoke, backed by low-key dark-fruit flavors. It's a nicely built, complex and satisfying wine."
Merlot,"There are drying tannins and an earthy underpinning to this bottling of the Gravity Merlot. The cherry and cassis flavors have good grip, leading into a coffee-coated finish."
Merlot,"While this smells a bit rough and herbal, it's more generous than the winery's varietal Tannat. This Merlot has some of the same scratchy qualities of the Tannat, but it shows more body and richness as well as riper black-fruit flavors."
Merlot,"The nose features some plum and faint cedar aromas, but not a lot of intensity; the light black-cherry and cedar flavors incorporate some earthy nuances on the finish. Light and correct, but where's the beef?"
Merlot,"This is 100% varietal. It has muscle and mass, with tart purple and black fruits wrapped into layers of earth and slightly metallic tannins. There is a green streak but it adds complexity and is not off-putting. This would be an excellent wine with a simple hanger steak."
Merlot,"Much like the other 2011 red wine releases from Cave B, this offers thin, tart red fruit, and strong herb and stem flavors in the finishing tannins."
Merlot,"Likably round and approachable, this medium-bodied red is mellow and fruity, showing red cherry fruit spiked with vanilla bean. It finishes on charred oak."
Merlot,"ound, lush and a bit warm, this is a velvety-textured Merlot with fruit characters that border on dried black cherry and plum rather than fresh fruit. Mocha and tobacco notes chime in, adding welcome complexity. Drink now–2012."
Merlot,"Paumanok's standard-label 2013 Merlot shares much of the same ripe ruddy fruit intensity of the Grand Vintage bottling. Lighter in body and a touch crisper on the palate, it's an elegant and nuanced yet more approachable wine. Taut with tannins and still tightly wound, it will still benefit from cellaring through 2022."
Merlot,"This is a rich, inviting wine with characteristics of dried cranberry and red currant, replete with dusty, spicy tannins and spicy, spiked vanilla. Lush, the tannins are soft and supple, a tad smoky, and the secondary elements darker in smoke, black licorice and espresso. Burly, it's balanced and refined."
Merlot,"With easy raspberry, cherry and sandalwood flavors, this has the softness you want in Merlot, although it lacks some complexity."
Merlot,"Nicely styled, showing lots of licorice in the nose and in the flavors. Blackberry and plum, cedar and spice are gently introduced, and the balance of fruit, acid and tannin is taut and proportionate."
Merlot,"Roasted, burnt, savory aromas of black fruits, char and campfire announce that this Merlot spent time in toasty oak. In the mouth, this is fresh but full bodied, with staunch tannins. Flavors of foresty blackberry, plum, vanilla and fall leaves finish dry and tannic."
Merlot,"While initially quite smoky and nutty on the nose, this light-bodied wine does release prettier notes of cherry and raspberry with some aeration. Soft acidity lends heaviness to the plate. The finish is brisk and clean."
Merlot,"A bit lean in fruit, in keeping with this problem vintage. Aromas of damp earth, cigar and thyme have just a hint of blackberry. The tannins are very finely ground, and soft acidity makes for a pleasant mouthfeel, but it's thin stuff."
Merlot,"This is an intriguing wine, with the extraction and the alcohol seemingly dialed back. Somewhat light in color, it brings aromas of fresh herb, sweet spice, cedar and cherry. The flavors are elegant and cranberry tart. It doesn't come off as entirely varietal but there's plenty of enjoyment to be had, especially if paired with food."
Merlot,"This release of Luca Sanjust's monumental Merlot is more subdued than the previous vintage, but what it lacks in intensity it makes up for in elegance. Instead of bursting red fruit and thick density, this feminine wine offers bite-size bursts of soft cherry, forest floor and toasted almond. It's smooth and supple in the mouth."
Merlot,"A little harsh and irregular in tannins, with strong, ripe flavors of cherry and raspberry jam that finish sweet. It's a rustic wine for drinking with easy fare."
Merlot,"The mouthfeel on this wine is rustic, with a jagged edge that hints of green tannins. But it does have some good red cherry, currant, spice and oak flavors, and a certain elegance."
Merlot,"This concentrated red opens with aromas of mature black fruit, toasted oak and a whiff of Mediterranean herbs. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, red currant, powdered sage and espresso alongside bracing, tightly packed tannins that leave an astringent finish."
Merlot,"Meaty, condensed and full of understated plum and berry fruit. This is a nice bargain Merlot with currant, plum and pepper for flavors, and then a dash of mellow coffee on the finish. With solid core flavors and an integrated mouthfeel, it ranks as a positive wine for the money."
Merlot,"Rich and dry, this has pleasant cherry, red currant, licorice and spice flavors, with a touch of smoky oak."
Merlot,"This is a good yet basic Merlot with baked berry aromas. The mouthfeel is more lively and raw in feel, with modest berry and spice flavors that hit quick and hollow at just as quickly. A standard finish is fine but doesn't evolve."
Merlot,"Dry berry aromas feature a minty, spicy side. The palate feels drying, with a raspberry flavor and a green herb note. It's medium-bodied, with a hint of plum in addition to resiny wood and green flavors on the finish."
Merlot,"Pure Merlot, ripe and fruity, this wine has only the lightest of tannic structure. That makes for a soft rounded wine from the area close to Lussac Saint-Émilion. Black plum and berry flavors are laced with acidity and finish with a smooth aftertaste. Drink now."
Merlot,"Only in Washington can you find pure varietal, single-vineyard Merlot at this price that shows such power and depth. Aged in American oak barrels with French oak stave inserts, it displays plenty of smoky caramel and coconut flavors, but the fruit is there in good proportion. This wine is sure to find plenty of admirers; if only more than just 58 cases had been produced."
Merlot,"This is a bold and ripe wine from the gravel soil of Lalande de Pomerol. It is now reaching maturity. It has rich blackberry fruits, layered with acidity. The tannic core is still firm giving the wine the chance to age further. Drink until 2022."
Merlot,"Green aromas of oregano and basil blend with tomato and red plum. It feels grabby and thick, with heavy flavors of carob and herb-accented red berry."
Merlot,"This is a Merlot you might want to lay down for a while. On release, it's dry and tannic, with primary fruit cherry and red currant flavors that are only just starting to shake hands with the oak. By 2016, it will be as good as it ever will get."
Merlot,"If this Merlot had greater flavor intensity, it would be spectacular. It's a very nice photocopy of a great Merlot, meaning that the berry and spice fruit is soft in focus but pleasurable. A great value—dry and classy in its own way."
Merlot,"This smells sweet and rubbery up front. The palate is tannic, with a blackberry flavor that starts sweet but turns bitter."
Merlot,"A good honest Merlot, with vanilla, spice cake and woodsy scents followed by cherry pie flavors and a medium finish of ash and green pepper. This is a subtle and restrained wine that should appeal to fans of Bordeaux. Drink now."
Merlot,"There are some problems here, beginning with a vegetal, asparagus smell and ending with a soft, simple syrup finish. In between are some decent cherry flavors wrapped into harsh tannins."
Merlot,"Principally sourced from the Cold Creek Vineyard, this reserve-level Merlot does not quite come up to past vintages. It's balanced and firm, with red and black fruits that currently seem overtaken by the time (22 months) spent in 78% new French oak."
Merlot,"Black cherry flavor stars in this full-bodied, brawny and expressive red that's thick with jammy fruit and interwoven tannins and oak."
Merlot,"This highly concentrated, richly ripe red explores notions of plum, black cherry and tobacco. It finishes with a mildness of dried herb."
Merlot,"Though the oak is high quality (62% new American and French), it's in your face on this 100% varietal wine, with notes of char and toast. It's soft, silky and elegant in feel but the barrel flavors take over making it hard to get all the fruit notes."
Merlot,"An unusual aroma profile of sandalwood, broccoli and exotic spices leads to coffee and dark cherries. The fruit flavors are silky in feel, showing plenty of depth with lightly grainy tannins supporting them."
Merlot,"This one's heavily about the oak. Comes out with spiced-up, minty aromas. Next up is a full and biting palate with buttery lead flavors followed by bitter black fruit. Flashes by quick on the finish."
Merlot,"The grapes come from the Applegate valley and the blend is 100% Merlot. The flavors are not particularly varietal; they are broader and more rustic, reminiscent of Carmenère. The palate impression is of soft, sweet, light blueberry fruit, for immediate drinking."
Merlot,"Aromas of cocoa and coffee are mixed with black licorice and dark berries, with this wine showing some reduction out of the gate that detracts. The flavors are rich and full bodied, carrying some warmth on the finish. The aromas and flavors seem disconnected."
Merlot,"Here's a lively Tuscan Merlot with soft layers of spice and cola lavished over a solid core of black fruit. The aromas are pristine and focused and the wine makes an equally excellent impression in the mouth thanks to its soft, yielding tannins and sweet cherry flavors."
Merlot,"A round, solidly made wine, with Bing cherry flavors. However, the middle seems to disappear and, as a result, the following tannins feel a bit harsh. —P.G."
Merlot,"Fresh red fruit flavors are framed with interesting and lifting notes of savory herbs, whole tobacco leaf and a touch of milk chocolate. It's juicy and lively with fine tannins and a mouthwatering finish."
Merlot,"A rather ordinary Merlot, dry and rugged, with jammy-fruity flavors of cherries, herbs and oak. Blended with Beckstoffer Cabernet Sauvignon, which gives it needed body and power."
Merlot,"Berry aromas come in front of a tart pie cherry and rhubarb palate. The feel is tight and acidic, so it lacks for mouthfeel and cries out for food. As a bistro or supermarket buy it offers the most potential."
Merlot,"Here's a strongly flavored Merlot, made with ultraripe fruit. If it didn't have a good structure, the blackberry, currant, mocha and anise flavors alone would make it a fruit bomb. Fortunately, fine acidity and gorgeously thick tannins give it structure and backbone. Best for a year or two."
Merlot,"A nose of black cherry and red berry leads on this Romanian Merlot, followed by flavors of cherry and spice. Backed by a solid tannic structure but slightly acidic, this wine will pair well with grilled meats."
Merlot,"An outstanding wine. Beautifully integrated fruit flavors suggest cherry pie and ripe strawberry, with dusty herbs scattered throughout. The herbal notes are not at all bitter or tannic, so the wine has an elegance to it, and shows nicely developed and integrated flavors."
Merlot,"Full-bodied and firmly structured, this smells a bit peppery and roasted, then gives up dried cherry and blackberry flavors that fill the mouth and taste generous and soothing. It has benefited from the extra age since bottling, and is ready to enjoy."
Merlot,"An ultra-dry, solid Merlot, filled with hard tannins and zingy acidity. Deep down under are some pretty good black cherry and cedar flavors. Your gamble is to cellar it, as it's just too tough to enjoy now."
Merlot,"Named for the producer's French grandfather, who loved Merlot, this 100% varietal wine from a high-elevation site is leathery, meaty and quite debonair. With a scent of bacon grease giving a sense of rustic deliciousness, it's also soft and unctuous on the palate, medium to full bodied."
Merlot,"This has light, pretty cherry and raspberry fruit flavors, forward and slightly sweet. The acids are chewy and puckery—acidification?—and therefore the finish is rather citric and sharp. The addition of 25% Cabernet Sauvignon may have also contributed."
Merlot,"Baking spice and vanilla aromas are at the fore, followed by blue fruit and barrel spices. The barrel influence (71% new French and American) leads on the palate as well, with abundant vanilla flavors that wash over the fruit. There's some good fruit underneath, if you can get to it."
Merlot,"This Tuscan Merlot shows unripe aromas of green herb and olive backed by a raw, sharp feel. It does offer bright acidity on the close."
Merlot,"Warm, rubbery berry aromas mixed with smoked meat and herbal accents make for a solid nose, and while the palate has clampy acidity and herbal notes, there's ample body, roundness and berry fruit to bring it home. Both leafy and candied on the finish."
Merlot,"This is a beautifully fragrant Merlot from cool-climate northern Italy that shows pristine aromas of cherry, wild berry, red rose and Indian spice. The wine is structured and smooth on the finish with soft, plush tannins."
Merlot,"This wine delivers plump cherry and blackberry with a soft, velvety, easy-going mouthfeel."
Merlot,"Dry and scoury in texture, this everyday Merlot has flavors of cherries, currants, cocoa, and cedar. It has some real richness."
Merlot,"Not as successful as the winery's Cabernet, this Merlot is very dry and tannic, with only modest blackberry fruit flavors, but it has a certain elegance. Turns oaky and herbal on the finish. Probably best soon."
Merlot,"There's no question about the variety, with its jazzy aromas of raspberries, blackberries and graphite that lead to plump plush layered fruit flavors. It brings an unabashed sense of deliciousness, with a finish that won't quit."
Merlot,"This old-school winery sticks to tradition, so if this new-release Merlot seems older than it is, that's by intention. The color is light, and the wine already carries fading edges. The nose is earthy and the flavors are spicy."
Merlot,"The color is substantial, and the wine has some spicy tartness. Moderately ripe red fruits, firm acids and balanced tannins tell the story."
Merlot,"Made using grapes grown in Jarvis's mountain vineyard, this is a strongly flavored Merlot. It's brilliant and intense, with flavors of red cherry pie, red licorice, grilled Canadian bacon and sandalwood. The tannic structure is a joy—soft, furry and complex. There's lots of oak, too, which lends a smoky edge. Probably at its best now, so drink up."
Merlot,"Merlot is a variety that receives little respect—or accolades—in Australia, but this one is a cut above the rest. The complex nose is classic Chinese tea and herbs with some Shiraz-like tar notes that lead into plum and raspberry flavors in the mouth. Finishes a bit short but with a nice, coconut-infused acidic lift."
Merlot,"Nearly all varietal with just a splash of Syrah (3%) added, it has notes of sweet spices, cocoa, and cherry backed by dry, chalky tannins. A pleasant easy drinker."
Merlot,"This is dry, medium bodied and extraordinarily rich, bearing flavors of baked black-cherry pie, mocha and grilled prosciutto, with a long, spicy finish. So what if it's too soft, or if there's a trace of overripeness? It's all part of the wine's personality."
Merlot,"Offering layers of juicy black currant, this is a soft, malleable wine, subtle in oak and tannin, blended with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. A touch of cedar and herb provides additional character, while the finish lands softly."
Merlot,"Jumbled aromas of grilled meat, asphalt and black cherry candy require patience and modest standards, while the palate is regular, a touch sticky and cloying, with sweet but generic berry fruit flavors. Dry and fairly snappy on the finish."
Merlot,"Here's a good, sound Merlot that's fancy enough to serve with special fare. It's dry and rich in tannins, with oak-inspired black cherry, currant and pepper flavors. Easy to find, with 29,000 cases produced. The alcohol measures 16%."
Merlot,"A blend of Loess Vineyard and Leonetti Old Block, this wine is 100% varietal. The aromas are bright and pure, with notes of raspberry, cherry, plum, anise and spice. The flavors deliver, with a sense of understated appeal."
Merlot,"At this price, a decent party wine to serve when no one's fussy. It's dry, medium-bodied and fruity, with a pleasant cut of tannins."
Merlot,"Dry and full-bodied, this clean Merlot has enough varietal character to satisfy. It offers blackberry and currant flavors that are touched by a bit of oak."
Merlot,"This big soft wine smells and tastes a little sweet, as an aroma like maple syrup leads to flavors of blackberry jam, cinnamon and butter."
Merlot,"Smooth and clean, with a soft, buttery style. This broadly fruity, immediately enjoyable Merlot is clearly intended for near-term enjoyment."
Merlot,"There are lots of ripe cherry, blackberry and cola flavors in this Merlot. It's a simple, elegant wine that's dry and silky in texture. Drink now."
Merlot,"This wine shows underripe red currant and strawberry notes, with a tinge of green stems and black pepper on the nose and palate. The mildly concentrated body is round, approachable and ready-to-drink."
Merlot,"Despite the difficult vintage and this wine's high production, Kenwood has managed to wrest plenty of raspberry and cherry fruit out of the grapes. The result is a pleasant, clean Merlot for drinking now."
Merlot,"Forward and spicy, this puts some muscle into the Merlot with earthy, tongue-gripping tannins. The fruit has a sweet tomato flavor, with a streak of cherry candy. Though not entirely knit together, it's a pleasant drink best enjoyed young."
Merlot,"The opaque eggplant hue of this stunning value promises much—and what's in the glass delivers. Prominent oaky notes are layered over plum and high-toned floral aromas. Dense and voluptuous on the palate, with chewy tannins, this is a seriously ambitious wine that could benefit from a year or two in the bottle."
Merlot,"This 100% varietal wine, a steal of a deal, works in its offering of juicy plum, just enough grip and pleasant structure. Integrated oak helps it maintain a lightly firm texture on the palate, piquing in cranberry and red currant flavors on the finish."
Merlot,"Raspingly dry and fierce in tannins, this Merlot is quite different from other Bordeaux-style red wines from Oakville that are ripe and lush. Doesn't offer much reward now due to the astringency, but has a solid core of blackberries. Hard to know if the fruit will outlast the tannins."
Merlot,"Simple, direct and country-style, this is soft and a little overripe, with flavors of raisin, milk chocolate and black raspberry jam."
Merlot,"Get a case of this and make it your house wine for easy drinking. It's dry and spicy, and has enough cherry, berry and cola flavors to satisfy your tastebuds."
Merlot,"A healthy addition of 12% Petit Verdot plays well in this wine. This is exuberant in black plum, chocolate and black pepper, with full-bodied and present oak, yet it also has a soft, approachability to the palate."
Merlot,"This wine is flat and simple, with touches of herbaceous earthiness and cedar. Plum and blueberry-fruit flavors are welcoming if lacking in complexity, with the finish offering a hint of cinnamon."
Merlot,"Dry and a little sharp, with blackberry, currant, mocha, tea and herb flavors. The tannic astringency really needs rich grilled meats to balance it."
Merlot,"Gritty marginally ripe plum aromas smell a bit like a wild field. This feels full but pushy, with roughness to the palate. Herbal plum and blackberry flavors finish minty and slightly green."
Merlot,"Sweet aromas of cherry, blueberry, cinnamon and nutmeg appear at first but slowly give way to more complex aromas of toasted almond, cola and cedar. You'll enjoy the smoothness and suppleness of this Merlot that would pair with milk-marinated pork or sweet barbecue baby back ribs."
Merlot,"Light in color and just as light in body, this Merlot smells like cherry, plum and chewing gum. A lean linear palate generates tart generic red-fruit flavors prior to a sour finish."
Merlot,"A nicely made wine at an attractive price, this offers crowd-pleasing elements of juicy black cherry, cassis and cedar around smoky oak and a medium-bodied concentration that remains succulent on the palate."
Merlot,"This wine shows a ton of oak influence, from the smoky charred aromas to the sweet-seeming maple syrup flavors to the velvety clinging texture. It is medium bodied, lush in mouthfeel and high in spice content that dominates the fruit flavors underneath."
Merlot,"Combine a cool year with cool-climate, single-vineyard origins and the result is this: olive, bell pepper and saucy tomato aromas, followed by a pointy, high-acid palate that's jagged in feel. Snappy red-plum and red-cherry flavors end with acid-driven crispness."
Merlot,"Merlot is on the comeback trail and this is a very fun style made by respected vineyard manager Erik Mallea. Woody red and black cherry meet with cola on the nose, while the palate remains bright, fruity, refreshing and easy to quaff. Flavors of black cherry soda meet with a milk chocolate character, yet without any overdone richness."
Merlot,"Rich, lush and oaky with aromas and flavors of ripe red plum, red berries and vanilla cream. Round and full in the mouth with solid but soft tannins and moderate acidity. The finish is long and lingering, with suggestions of vanilla ice cream topped with mixed berry compote. Drink now."
Merlot,"Though labeled merlot, this is truly a Bordeaux-style blend with Cabernet Sauvignon (6%), Malbec (5%), and Petit Verdot (2%) added to the mix. It is reserved in style with notes of cherry, dried herbs and pickling spices backed by firm, dry tannins."
Merlot,"In a challenging vintage, this shows excellent structure around rather light fruit. Strawberry and cherry come into play, with some well-managed tannic strength from the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and a splash of Malbec."
Merlot,"This Merlot currently offers a dry palate and firm tannins. As it warms in the glass, subtle blackberry, cola and pepper notes emerge. It's pretty tightly wound for a Merlot, but it's attractively priced and should soften with a little time to breathe."
Merlot,"This shows the fleshiness of Merlot. But it's also enormously tannic, with a mouth-numbing astringency, and the finish is severely dry. With black cherry and herb flavors, it wants an hour or two in the decanter, but it's not an ager."
Merlot,"Made entirely with Merlot, this opens with aromas of black cherry and caramel that follow through to the dense palate along with a hint of cedar. Clenching tannins leave a mouth-puckering finish."
Merlot,Unusual aromas of singe and tar are interspersed with Chinese tea and vanilla while flavors in the mouth turn a bit soupy. Medium-bodied with some grippy tannins and a short finish. Drink now.
Merlot,"Meaty, woody aromas carry along some cherry and cinnamon, but those scents are distant and slightly artificial. The mouth is chunky and big, with plenty of buttery oak along with nondistinct red fruit. The feel is sharp, courtesy of strong acids, so there's a tangy, astringent final impression. –M.S."
Merlot,"This vineyard-designated wine includes 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Syrah. The Syrah component seems to take over, in the form of tart berry, herb and dried leaf flavors. The alcohol, which is 15.5%, mutes any other complexities. It's a nice wine, but it doesn't offer standard Washington Merlot flavors."
Merlot,Thin aromas of cherries and oregano show on the nose of this simple but quaffable bottling. The palate combines fruit punch and candied cherries with a hint of more herbs.
Merlot,"This wine has a rich, velvety character that gives it solo sipping appeal. Pepper and mocha on the nose flow into dark fruit and mocha flavors on the palate. Paired with a good structure and long finish, the wine is both elegant and intriguing."
Merlot,"Here's a good, sound Merlot that's fancy enough to serve with special fare. It's dry and rich in tannins, with oak-inspired black cherry, currant and pepper flavors. Easy to find, with 29,000 cases produced. The alcohol measures 16%."
Merlot,"Structured in young tannins, this wine has a nice mélange of leather, blackberry, clove and black tea that provide substance and flavor, with additional savory specks of graphite. Light bodied and soft, the acidity behind the fruit suggests further aging, through 2020."
Merlot,"Here's an everyday Merlot whose most attractive feature is its fresh, keen fruit. The blackberries and cherries are wrapped into firm tannins, but the wine isn't an ager, so drink it now with rich, fatty meats and cheeses."
Merlot,"Light aromas of barrel spice and red and black fruit are followed by sweet fruit flavors. It delivers enjoyment, but the flavors seem slightly dried out."
Merlot,"A good everyday Merlot, dry and rich in tannins, with pleasant cherry, cocoa, licorice, herb and spice flavors."
Merlot,"Grapes come from Alexander, Dry Creek and Russian River valleys to make this wine, first released in 1997. Oaky and mild-mannered on the palate, it shows touches of clove, black pepper and dried herb, while robust tannins play a supporting role."
Merlot,"A little simple, but nicely dry and elegant in the tannins, which are smooth and grippy. Offers good flavors of cherries, mulberries, spices and sweet oak. Drink now."
Merlot,"Heavy wood aging dominates this rich wine at this stage. That should integrate to leave an almost California ripeness from the 100% Merlot. It has a full and rounded structure, cushioned by generous fruits."
Merlot,"Bright violet in color and well extracted, but also vegetal. You'd think from the hue and vintage that it would be seamlessly ripe, but it seems green at the core. Thus while it delivers texture, rich plum fruit and tannic structure, there's a gap in  clarity of fruit flavor."
Merlot,"This wine comes from an assortment of top sites across the Columbia Valley and it shows. Aromas of dried herbs, pencil lead, toasty spice and blue and red fruit lead to sweet, rich and appealing flavors. There's intensity but also a good sense of acid and chalky tannic structure backing things up, along with undeniable deliciousness."
Merlot,"A very dry, somewhat herbal Merlot, with a brittle, tannic mouthfeel. It has flavors of black cherries, currants and sage. Feels elegant and sophisticated in the mouth, a wine to drink now."
Merlot,"A 100% varietal wine, this opens in floral violet perfume, delicate notions that are soon overpowered by the chock-a-block blackberry and plum. The tannins are robust and still integrating, giving the wine a somewhat harsh feel."
Merlot,"This reserve spends 30 months in barrel. It has lovely aromatics, with subtle suggestions of tobacco and clove woven through the base of ripe black cherry and cassis. The tannins are polished, and the finish lends a thread of iron."
Merlot,"A good wine, dry and softly tannic, with cherry, red currant, violet, cocoa and sandalwood flavors, and it has an easy-drinking quality that makes it a good companion to steak. Seems best soon for its precocious fruit."
Merlot,"Volatile aromas of cranberry, cherry and vanilla are followed by gritty lightly sweet cranberry and green-pepper flavors that show some astringency. The concentration seems lacking."
Merlot,"Dry earthy herbal aromas of tomato, red-berry fruits and oak set up a full palate with pounding tannins. This tastes roasted and herbal, with notes of bell pepper, tomato and creamy oak. A hard-tannin finish confirms that this Merlot skipped charm school."
Merlot,"This is Pepper Bridge Merlot, and it beautifully expresses the vineyard trademarks: fresh fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, spread out broadly across the palate, and backed with tart acids and light tannins. There is a strong streak of Asian spicebox as well, but overall the wineis very approachable, which makes it is a Merlot to enjoy with rich fish, such as salmon. It's bright and lightly spicy and not too heavy."
Merlot,"The aromas offer notes of cocoa, herb, cedar, cherry and barrel spice. The palate is somewhat barrel-forward but otherwise shows a pleasing sense of balance along with a lingering finish."
Merlot,"Soft and fruity-sweet, with jammy flavors of cherries, teriaki beef, pepper and cedar. Drink now."
Merlot,"Blackberry syrup, loamy soils and light mint show on the nose of this bottling by self-made vintners Don and Jennifer Arndt. There is a tense and tarry tannic structure to the sip, with deep and brooding flavors of blackened purple fruit most prominent."
Merlot,"Thick, rich and woody, this herbal, estate-grown red shows a wealth of baked-plum flavor laced in vanilla, with richness bursting on the finish."
Merlot,"Once again the Merlot is the best of a very fine flight of Tulpen wines. More muscular than the Cabernet, it includes 10% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot in the mix, resulting in a dense, dark wine loaded with black fruits. Polished tannins are lightly layered in streaks of leaf, herb and earth. The alcohol tops 15%, but there is not a hint of heat in the finish."
Merlot,"As part of a single-parcel single-varietal range, this 100% Merlot is rich while keeping a fine sense of proportion and balance. With red fruits (laden with young tannins), touches of wood and plenty of acidity, this is developing into a ripe wine. Juicy and fruity as well as structured, it will be ready to drink from 2019."
Merlot,"A chewy, high-acid take on Merlot, with a strong herbal note to the tannins. It might almost pass for Carmenère. The fruit flavors are subdued but ripe enough, and the alcohol touches 14.7%. This is the sort of muscular Merlot that can take the place of Cabernet alongside a grilled steak."
Merlot,"This Merlot has a fair splash of both Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. It does not shy away from underbrush accents of leaf and herb, adding complexity to the cherry fruit."
Merlot,"Complex fruit, herb and subtle oak aromas lead to an appetizingly dry feel and mellow, woodsy, autumnal flavors. It's medium bodied, smooth-textured and just savory enough to complement the tasty fruit flavors."
Merlot,"At first, a rush of front-loaded plum and blackberry fruit hits the palate, then the flavors seem to sag a bit entering the midpalate. A wall of still-to-be-resolved oak leads into a hard, astringent, somewhat woody finish. Yet there is a substantial and well-built wine here, waiting to resolve its components into a more seamless whole. Retasted after being open a full day, it showed well, suggesting good aging potential."
Merlot,"This producer makes a perennial standout of the variety. It is subdued and elegant in its approach to the lengthy layered weight and the integrated fruit. Plum, cedar and black licorice form a core of flavor over soft supple tannin and peppery oak, ending in a burst of spice and leather."
Merlot,"A beautiful dark plum color and elegant aromas of cherry, allspice and pepper lead this Virginia Merlot. Rich and savory notes and a bright fruit character are appealing but need time to age and integrate. Overall, a solid red for the cellar."
Merlot,"Good price for a Napa Merlot this rich. It's a soft, fleshy wine, with silky tannins and red cherry pie, licorice, bacon, black pepper and sandalwood flavors. Drink now with beef."
Merlot,"Sweet and simple, with sugary flavors of blackberry and cherry jam and smoky vanilla. Almost like a dessert wine."
Merlot,"Joined by 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this stellar wine from an almost 50-50 Napa-Sonoma divide delivers big flavor and tannin and yet exudes vibrant juicy plum and blueberry, keeping it grounded and alive. Silky through and through, it's complex in dark chocolate and a touch of dried herbs."
Merlot,"Aromas of toasted oak, espresso, coconut and dried black fruit slowly take shape in the glass. Made entirely with Merlot, the dense palate offers blackberry extract, black cherry, coffee and grilled sage alongside rather astringent tannins that dry out the finish."
Merlot,"This Merlot is not a flamboyant fruit monster, but quietly controlled with firm tannins and a hint of mushrooms accenting cherries and cola. Drink it now and through 2017."
Merlot,"Shades of golden toast and crushed granite lend depth and complexity to crisp red cherry flavors in this unusually brisk, sprightly Merlot. Refreshingly quaffable, a fringe of soft tannins linger on the short finish."
Merlot,"Fruity and simple, this Merlot tastes like the wine equivalent of a candied dessert pastry. It may not be technically sweet, but it's so extracted in raspberries, cherries and caramelized oak that it seems sweet."
Merlot,"Il Puro is a simple but genuine expression of Merlot with soft cherry nuances backed by light shadings of spice and mineral. The texture is smooth and silky, and although this is a very simple wine, it does deliver easy drinking pleasure."
Merlot,"Emmolo has been producing decent Merlots for years, and this '09 is reflective of their style. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's not very exciting either, offering pleasant cherry and oak flavors that are a little sweet."
Merlot,"A mushroomy underbelly lies beneath a layer of leather and graphite, making for a tight, dry wine with sizable tannin structure. Powerfully concentrated, this wine holds 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and is not for the faint of heart."
Merlot,"A plume of fresh blossoms and herbs lends lift to this plush, full-bodied Merlot. Luscious, creamy swirls of blackberry and cherry syrup penetrate deeply on the palate but are contrasted by sharp notes of sour cherry and cranberry. It's a brawny, fruit-forward wine, but not overbearing in stature."
Merlot,"A roasted, leathery cap sits atop a bouquet of meaty berry fruit, leading to a somewhat burnt and brambly set of aromas. The palate, however, is quite fresh and edgy, with good acidity pushing lively red-fruit and mild vanilla flavors. Herbal on the finish, but sturdy overall."
Merlot,"Soft and lightly fruity, this has an underlying chalkiness. That chalky sensation runs across the palate and seems to mute the other flavors, such as herb, which are on the light side."
Merlot,"Spicy in cinnamon and sultry tropical coconut, this wine offers a freshness of red fruit, true and varietal, with soft, lean layers of body and weight."
Merlot,"A blocky, toasty, chewy wine with a flavor mix of herb and earth and berries. The tannins are rough and leave a slightly bitter impression."
Merlot,"This pure Merlot wine suffers from excessive wood aging giving an extra-dry character. To compensate, the red fruit is perfumed and rich. Another year will help the softening process although probably not enough."
Merlot,"This is 100% single vineyard Merlot; broad, beautifully integrated, with seamless black fruits, streaks of coffee and smoke, and black pepper spice. A powerful Merlot with muscle and verve, it finishes smooth and lightly tasting of chocolate."
Merlot,"Lush aromas of ripe black cherries, graham crackers and menthol are generous and inviting on this promising Long Island Merlot. It's luscious and concentrated on the palate, but bracingly taut with acidity and a tart Morello-cherry finish."
Merlot,"Jammy, with flavors of white sugar, red and black cherries and buttered cinnamon toast. Drink with simple, sweet fare, like a hamburger with smothered onions, slathered in ketchup."
Merlot,"Cassis, bell pepper, toast, French oak and coconut lead the nose. The aromas carry over to the tightly wound palate along with raw red currant, powdered sage, licorice and a confectionery note. Close-grained tannins leave a rather astringent finish."
Merlot,"Cedar plank-grilled meat and herbal accents jazz up the heady black fruit core of this wine. Rich and dark, flavors of black berry, plum flesh, cigar box, licorice and pepper dance in the mouth and stay through the solid finish. Fine but firm tannins provide structure and texture, and the wine, though delicious now, should age nicely through 2014."
Merlot,Aromas of roasted savory berry fruits and baked beans are solid. This Merlot exhibits good grip on a medium-bodied palate. Salty earthy flavors of berry fruits and dry oak finish leafy and spicy.
Merlot,"Sweet, tart and simple, like the filling on a black-cherry pie. Not much else going on. Drink now."
Merlot,"This delivers smoke, coffee bean, dark red fruit and spice aromas. It's oak-forward on the palate, somewhat obscuring the fruit flavors, but it still brings appeal."
Merlot,"This wine suggests green, savory herbs along with cherry and currant. It's elegant in style, velvety in feel, and delivers good concentration to the fruit flavors plus barrel notes (20% new French) on the lingering finish. The variety gets lost with the herbal notes taking over, but it still offers enjoyment."
Merlot,"A pure expression of Merlot, this shows loads of red berry fruit, with a touch of rosemary oil or green herb. Aged for 12 months in oak, it is soft, sturdy, fruity and genuine."
Merlot,"A success despite a certain leanness, a young wine in need of mid-term cellaring. Notes of of green olives, bacon, unsweetened dark chocolate, and boysenberries are wrapped in sumptuous, lush tannins that melt on the palate. This bone dry wine needs rich meats."
Merlot,"Black cherry and pomegranate shine through the smoke, licorice and cedar aromas. The medium-bodied palate is lightly smoky, with more notes of cedar and vanilla. Dark fruits persist, supported by soft, dusty tannins and a pleasant lift of acidity on the finish."
Merlot,"A good, rich red wine, dry, soft and fruity. Shows ripe cherry, red licorice and bacon flavors, with a coating of sweet oak. Pretty and polished, a Merlot to drink now."
Merlot,"A very limited (three barrels) block selection, this is a tough, chewy wine that remains stubbornly closed even after being open a full 24 hours. Hard cherry candy is concentrated in a tannic casing, with streaks of licorice, dark chocolate, and slightly bitter herbs wrapped around it. But the power and stuffing are there for significant improvement over time."
Merlot,"Le Prunée is a simple expression of Merlot with layers of cherry, blackberry, spice, earth and old leather. You could easily pair this wine with roast chicken or pork thanks to the smooth nature of the mouthfeel."
Merlot,"This wine's barrel spice, licorice, cranberry and cherry aromas are high toned. The palate is broad, with generous fruit flavors that taper toward the finish."
Merlot,"A simple Merlot, sugary sweet and jammy in cherries, with harsh tannins and a bizarre slice of acidity."
Merlot,"A light, easy-drinking Merlot that spent two months in new French oak and otherwise speaks of dark plums and earth. Some bottle variation; two bottles tasted."
Merlot,"Run, don't walk, to find this rich Merlot. It shows vast berry, currant, mocha, licorice and cola flavors, wrapped into superfine tannins and balanced with fine acidity. Easy to find, with 7,600 cases produced."
Merlot,"A soft blackberry, vanilla and plum nose is followed by a rustic mélange of dried tea, berry and spice flavors in this Merlot. Tannins are firm and the overall flavors good, but the wine needs a little more cohesion."
Merlot,"This pure varietal blend of Merlot opens fragrantly with scents of black raspberry, black cherry, plum and smoke. Very young, tight and firmly packed, it's a wine that is already showing finesse and a pleasing tension between the tart fruit and the toasty, mocha-flavored oak. Given time in the bottle, it may well prove to be one of the best-aging Beresan Merlots ever made."
Merlot,"Big, smoky fruit and a nicely honed structure combine well in this full-bodied wine with touches of red cherry and berry and toasted wood."
Merlot,"Here's a quite dense Merlot, with plenty of grip and power. Black cherry and cassis fruit is firm and compact, with a generous frame of barrel char and dark chocolate. A lush and seductive selection that's delicious now."
Merlot,"The aromas of herbs, pencil lead and blue and red fruit are forward, fresh and appealing. The flavors follow similarly, showing depth and balance uncommon for a wine this price."
Merlot,"Lean and earthy, marked by tobacco, dill and less than ripe cherry flavors. Tannins are tough and gritty. The wine finishes very dry and rasping, showing little fruit. The winemaker seems to have understood the problem here, and added five percent Syrah."
Merlot,"Top flight Merlot, brimming with ripe black cherry, blackberry, chocolate, smoke, sage, thyme, anise and pepper notes. It's all framed in silky ripe tannins, smooth, sleek and lush. The finish is long. -J.M."
Merlot,"Layers of vanilla, spice and toast persist throughout this richly textured wine. Sunny raspberry and cherry flavors are pleasant, but peek through a bit shyly on the palate. It's an oaky wine, but supple and seductive with a fringe of finely grained, persistent tannins."
Merlot,"A really perfumed wine, full of oak and truffle aromas. With its juicy rich fruit, it is not a shy wine. Bold red fruits, balanced tannins and a ripe texture all contribute to the dense concentration. The alcohol shows in the pepper edge. Drink this just mature wine now."
Merlot,"Simple and soft, this is one to drink now. It rewards for the wealth of cherry, blackberry, licorice and cocoa flavors that finish dry and clean."
Merlot,"Bold, dark and compelling, the nose offers scents of tar, resiny herb, dark fruit and pastry spice. The chewy tannins are woven into this heavy hitter's full body, while uplifting acids keep the palate feeling steady and toned. Structured plum and tobacco notes drive the long, balanced finish."
Merlot,"Some good currant, cherry, cola and licorice flavors in this dry, balanced wine. It's one of the better Merlots out there at this affordable price."
Merlot,"There's tremendous value in this well-made wine. It's savory in its mix of dried herb and plum notes, with smooth, softened tannins and judicious use of oak that lends richness to the palate. It'll appeal broadly."
Merlot,"Briar patch, some green pepper and a little sweet baking spice carry the nose. The plum and berry flavors are accented by brown sugar and caramel, but also some green characteristics. The finish is smooth, but too green."
Merlot,"This is a rather bulky, chunky Merlot, with decent levels of grapy black cherry and cassis fruit. It lacks elegance, but makes up for it with plenty of intensity and flavor. Drink now."
Merlot,"A rich, thick, heavy Merlot, a little too soft and melted in structure, but so delicious, it's easy to like. Shows flashy black cherry jam, chocolate, roasted almond and caramel flavors, rather like a granola candy bar."
Merlot,"Strawberry and wet hay aromas give way to a sweet berry-flavored attack, but the wine turns tart and almost shrill on the finish. A green, stemmy sensation lingers in the mouth, along with dark coffee flavors."
Merlot,"Aromas of rich, concentrated blackberry preserves are accented with spice and char on this medium-bodied wine. Soft acidity adds refreshment to the midpalate, guiding a moderately long finish tinged with granite and fine-grained tannins."
Merlot,"If Washington “owns” Merlot as a category in the U.S. (not that anyone cares at the moment), this confirms it. You get ripe, sweet, tangy red berry fruit, fresh acids, ripe tannins and toasty oak; there may not be a better value in the country. The way the oak is used is magnificent and adds layer after layer to the extended finish."
Merlot,Notes of rhubarb and cherry don't stitch together. It drinks just off dry with a tart finish.
Merlot,"Soft and easy-drinking, this plum and cherry Merlot drinks like an older wine, as if it's been gently oxidized. It's probably at its peak, the fruit generous and round, the finish tailing off gently into a Milky Way sort of confection."
Merlot,"Roasted black olive and rubber aromas set up a tannic and heavy palate with a lot of oak but not much fruit to back it up. Tastes like cinnamon and spice, with middling blackberry and bitterness on the finish."
Merlot,"Here's a very fruity wine just brimming with sun-ripened cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors, with a kiss of smoky oak. It's nice, dry and balanced, and a good value for the money."
Merlot,"This is a flavorful, smooth-textured wine drenched with grapy, jammy flavors. Ripe and concentrated, it has a lively mouthfeel due to welcome tannins and acidity. It offers a lot to like."
Merlot,"This wine has all the necessary smoothness, plus deep plum and cherry flavors and touches of spicy oak, too. The texture feels layered and the fruit components are vivid and tasty. It all comes together gracefully on the palate and the finish."
Merlot,"The oak—52% new French— gets out in front of the fruit with notes of cocoa powder and woodspice overpowering herbs and red fruit. The palate is elegant in style, with barrel notes carrying through on the finish."
Merlot,"This fruit-forward wine offers plenty of ripe plum, cherry and berry aromas and flavors, with accents of black-forest cake and chocolate sauce on the palate. The mouthfeel is easy and refreshing, while the finish is short but clean and refreshing."
Merlot,"Supple and layered, this nicely captures the scope and scale of this superb vintage. It's still young, tight and quite compact, but shows threads of tobacco, anise, stone and pencil lead, along with full, fleshy, plum and cassis fruit. Great structure and dense, ripe tannins. This is a perfect illustration of why Washington Merlot can claim to be the best in the world outside of Pomerol."
Merlot,"This wine offers aromas of tire rubber and blue fruit. It drinks off dry, with tangy coffee and plum flavors, trailing toward the finish."
Merlot,"A powerful and concentrated wine, this has dark fruit aromas like black cherry along with black pepper and wood smoke, plus strong, ripe flavors from cherry to blackberry and black currant. It also has a lot of tannin and good acidity, and will mature into a softer feel over time."
Merlot,"This bottling has turned out to be one of California's more important Merlot releases. The '05, like its immediate predecessors, is a dry, richly tannic wine of great elegance and structural complexity. It pleases now for the wealth of black currants, anise, herbs, spices and smoky oak, and should develop bottle nuances through 2011."
Merlot,"The wood and alcohol seem to get out front of aromas of plum, raspberry and medicine cabinet. Flavors are sweet and concentrated with a tart, cranberry-filled finish. A lot of good things are going on but they don't quite seem to all come together."
Merlot,"At four-plus years, the tannins are resolved, although far from absent. Acidity is also high. Finally the wine is coming around, with spicy plum and cassis flavors, but it is teetering on the verge of old age already, and has an edge of senility."
Merlot,"This medium-bodied wine has bold aromas of black pepper, tobacco and clove that merge with straightforward cherry and herb flavors for a nicely complex profile. It has way more depth and interest than the price tag would suggest."
Merlot,"Sharp and tannic, with cherry, blackberry, coffee, cocoa and peppery flavors. Exuberantly rustic now, but could mellow with a year or two in the bottle."
Merlot,"A bit firmer and more powerful than the producer's regular bottling, the Vintner's Select boasts a core of black cherry and cassis accented by shades of bramble and forest floor. Rich, rounded and full bodied, it's balanced by a streak of cranberry acidity and lingering notes of anise."
Merlot,"This wine offers a delightful bouquet of blackberry and rose petal with touches of salinity. It is smooth and silky at first sip, with flavors of black plum, cherry, chocolate, lavender, and freshly roasted coffee. As it makes its way around the mouth, stern tannins make their presence known and then recede into a finish notable for a lingering espresso bean flavor."
Merlot,"Aged entirely in new French oak, this is an unabashedly juicy, decadently spiced Merlot that's rich with vanilla and black-cherry pie flavors. Structurally, it's quite refined, with fresh acidity and soft, feathery tannins that linger."
Merlot,"Oaky, smoky, earthy aromas and flavors dominate this full-bodied and firm-textured wine. A muscular, assertive wine, it should taste great with a grilled steak or lamb chop."
Merlot,"This is a pleasingly tongue-coating wine, with flavors of cherry preserves, eucalyptus and butterscotch. A nice touch of pleasant salinity makes way for an enduring finish."
Merlot,"This is arguably the winery's best Merlot ever. While it is not an ager, it is a lovely food wine that's dry, with crisp acidity. It expresses subtle flavors of cherry, red currant, tobacco and sandalwood flavors."
Merlot,"This smells a bit smoky, tastes ripe and almost sweet and feels smooth, juicy and not too full bodied. It has a tempting cherry syrup flavor, light tannins and welcome acidity to buoy up all the fruit flavors."
Merlot,"Always a fine value, Barnard Griffin's Merlot is a brightly fruit wine with tart red and purple berry flavors. Tannins are still a bit stiff, but proportionate and ripe enough, with hints of café mocha in the finish."
Merlot,"The sunshine of the Languedoc comes through in this wine's warm, soft fruit. A touch of acidity and a backdrop of tannins give it contrast and a fine, ready-to-drink character."
Merlot,"This youthful, tannic wine needs time in the glass to unfold, benefiting from the additions of 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc. A reductive style shows slightly on the nose before streaks of soy, leather and tobacco provide plenty of savory elements with which to play."
Merlot,"Coming from a cool vintage, this wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with aromas of green herbs, dill and baking spices. It's quite light in style, not entirely holding together."
Merlot,"Simple but authentic Merlot aromas of plum, tea and spice cake make up the opening act. The juicy palate has good berry flavor alongside soft tannins and finishes with an earthy note. Not one for aging."
Merlot,"This full-bodied wine shows smooth and rounded plum fruit. The flavors are mouth-filling, but the rather quick fade suggests it's best consumed in the near term, as it's already five years past harvest."
Merlot,"The nose on this Merlot is earthy, with savory scents of mushroom, soft fruit and spice, but on the palate, the wine could use a bit more structure and presence. Overall though, it's balanced and friendly, and will pair well with myriad mild-flavored dishes."
Merlot,"Smoke and dark chocolate notes abound on this elegant Long Island Merlot (made with 10% Petit Verdot). A touch austere on the palate, it has a black plum flavor shaded with hints of resin, leaves and game. Bold tannins add structure and power."
Merlot,"An enjoyable easy drinker with notes of bell pepper and sugared plum. It's broad in feel, lightly sweet with abundant plum flavors."
Merlot,"Meager and slightly thin, this offers red fruit, herbal cedar and tobacco, though the flavors are subtle and hard to make out."
Merlot,"This Brazilian Merlot smells rubbery and gaseous, with saucy berry notes. In the mouth, this is severely tannic and drying. Toasty, blackened and bitter in flavor, this ends with peppery notes and hard-pounding tannins."
Merlot,"Nicely perfumed on the nose, this Merlot has 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Syrah blended in, giving it a well-rounded composition and bright black cherry around firm, still prominent tannins. It could use some time in the cellar, through 2018, or a decant."
Merlot,"Licorice and warm blacktop make for a dark nose, yet there isn't much base to the acidic palate. There's grabby, tangy generic fruit but mostly tartness and sizzle. An edgy wine with a spot of mocha on a sharp finish."
Merlot,"From the southern slopes of Bordeaux's Entre-deux-Mers, this is rounded, fleshy and packed with plum and smoke flavors. It has the vintage's richness and the soft tannins, making it already drinkable."
Merlot,"A softer, more forward style than the Old Stage, showing more density and soft tannins. Light cherry fruit, good balance, texture, weight. Some hints of wood, earth and mineral too."
Merlot,"Although it's a little slender and simple, it's good for the price and offers pleasant cherry and spice flavors that finish dry."
Merlot,"Straightforward plum, cherry and tomato aromas lead to a juicy palate that's lacking in structure. Simple slightly sweet plum and black-currant flavors finish with a note of peppery spice. At only 11.5% ABV, this is Merlot is an easy sipper."
Merlot,"Shows the soft, supple side of Merlot, with smooth tannins framing earthy flavors of sour-cherry candy, herbs and cedar. Ready to drink now."
Merlot,"This young vineyard is starting to make a name for itself with winemakers, and this 100% varietal wine demonstrates why. It's a classically Washington Merlot that shows appealing aromas of milk chocolate-covered raspberries. The feel is supple with sweet, luscious red fruit flavors that linger."
Merlot,"Pretty robust in style for Merlot, with the ripe black-cherry fruit framed by plenty of structure. There's a minty or resiny note to the aromas and flavors, which imparts a slightly medicinal edge to the prolonged finish. Drink now–2012, possibly beyond."
Merlot,"So rich it tastes like chocolate, this ambitious and lavishly oak-influenced wine pulls out all the stops to achieve maximum flavor impact. It smells full of baking spices and savory herbs, tastes very ripe, concentrated and feels lush and creamy in texture. While full bodied, it has plenty of firm acidity and lots of fine tannins to stand up to all that flavor. It's ready to enjoy now through 2020."
Merlot,"The first Merlot offering from this producer, this is 100% varietal and totally full-throttle in its fleshy components of vanilla and chocolate, seasoned in cinnamon. Fresh and somewhat floral, it's bright despite its size and lively on the palate. The wine is made in tiny amounts."
Merlot,"The label reads Washington, but it's a single-vineyard Yakima Valley Merlot, with small amounts of three other Bordeaux varieties blended in. Sharp, earthy and firm, with rather thin fruit flavors and a finish both tart and tannic."
Merlot,"Tasted in October, this still-young Merlot is tannic and jammy. It shows fresh primary fruit flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries that are a bit one-dimensional. Give it until mid-2008 to develop some bottle complexity."
Merlot,"Smells good and rich, with waves of plum, blackberry, tar and smoke aromas, and the flavors are very similar. Drinks dry and tasty in the mouth, but loses a few points for a gritty tartness through the finish."
Merlot,"Enticing and idiosyncratic on the nose, this Merlot offers notes of rose petal, smoke, blood orange and caraway seed. The palate is medium bodied and the 13% alcohol gives it a sense of finesse. Fine but firm tannins frame the cherry fruit, and it finishes with hints of maduro and rose."
Merlot,"A soft, nicely oaked Merlot with flavors of baked plum and ripe blackberry. Full-bodied in every sense of the word, with just a sprinkling of spice on the finish."
Merlot,"This isn't a wine to age. It's soft and appealing in its charms, offering drink-me-now cherries, red currants, herbs and sandalwood. The winemaker blended it with a little Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Verdot, which gives it structural and flavor complexities."
Merlot,"Tough and gritty in texture, with a raisined edge to the black cherry and currant flavors. Finishes in a scour of astringency. Clean and dry, but not going anywhere, so drink up."
Merlot,"A distinguished Merlot, dark, dry and brooding. Complex, too, with deep flavors of blueberry, mushroom, dark chocolate and anise. The tannins are fairly fierce despite the softness, but the wine doesn't seem like a longterm ager, so give it a decant before drinking over the next few years."
Merlot,"100% varietal from one of Washington's most esteemed vineyards, it's tightly wound and slow to reveal its charms. Notes of clove, woodspice, raspberry and cherry re supported by firm, slightly dry tannins that need time to soften."
Merlot,"Green, grassy and not very appealing. There's a can't-miss murky, green, herbal character here that yields almost weedy fruit flavors and carob. Sweet, candied, green and just not that good for a Paul Hobbs-made wine."
Merlot,"A sound, rather generic red wine, medium- to full-bodied, with sleek tannins framing jammy cherry and raspberry flavors. Pretty good for the price, and easy to find, with 42,000 cases produced."
Merlot,"This Merlot is of everyday quality, with an easy-to-like silky texture and soft, almost sweet flavors of cherry, mocha and spice. It's not a bad value, and it should be widely available."
Merlot,"A bit unripe, with herb and mint flavors side by side with blackberry and cassis. Shows classic Napa mountain structure of tannins and acids, but the mint reprises on the sharp finish. Not an ager."
Merlot,"Easy to like this softly appealing Merlot. It's a gentle wine, with a silky texture, and has candied flavors of cherries and raspberries. Pretty good price for a nice Napa Merlot."
Merlot,"This unusual 100% varietal offering comes from this winery's young estate vineyard. Aromatically it offers notes of candied red apple, wheat cereal, raspberries and dry chocolate. The chocolate, cherry and apple flavors are sweet, ripe and full, backed by dry, grainy tannins."
Merlot,"This wine has a smoky char quality and a decadent richness of cured meat and bacon grease. Light, it's dusted modestly in spice, with an herbaceous tease of tannin on the finish."
Merlot,"Jammy, earthy and baked on the nose, this ripe Merlot is dishing plenty of black plum and blackberry characteristics from front to back. The palate is concentrated and borderline syrupy in feel, while ripe, baked blackberry flavors come with chocolaty oak and vanilla on the finish."
Merlot,"Very big and smoky, an impressive young Merlot that grabs you by the collar and shakes you. Made by the veteran Robert Foley, it's in his style, a ripe, powerful wine exuding massive flavors of black cherries, cassis and chocolate."
Merlot,"There's plenty of toasty oak flavor (the wine spent 27 months in barrel) along with pretty raspberry and cherry fruit. Dark notes come in with the tannins—smoke and char, along with a coconut kick to the finish."
Merlot,"This medium-bodied wine smells like a cherry pie, tastes quite ripe and fruity, and has a smooth texture and lightly sweet finish."
Merlot,"Petit Verdot makes up a full 14% of this wine, which also includes 9% Cabernet Franc. Penetrating aromas of raspberries, fresh cherries, licorice, herb, vanilla and barrel spices are at the fore. The flavors are plush and juicy, bringing a sense of elegance and poise. The barrel aromas and flavors are prominent, but it still brings appeal."
Merlot,"Quite rich and distinguished, with the full-bodied weight and rich, thick tannins of a fine Cabernet, yet with Merlot's flavors of cherries, plums, and violets, with a white chocolate edge. Impresses for its youthful purity and deliciousness, as well as the refined texture."
Merlot,"The third reserve by this producer made of this variety, this is 100% estate and varietal. It unfurls in fireplace smoke, red and black berry, leather and tobacco, with an edginess of cedar and herb. The texture is soft and integrated around a full-bodied concentration of flavor."
Merlot,"This Merlot has a nose of violets, cherry cola and talc powder. In the mouth, it tastes like red berries, blackberries and finishes with touch of milk chocolate."
Merlot,"Like most Casillero varietals, this Merlot offers good concentration and a mix of berry fruit and light herbal aromas. The palate is lively, with good acidity and zesty red plum and pie cherry flavors. It's a little tangy throughout but on the plus side it's not overdone or heavy."
Merlot,"This '04 is off a beat from the '03, showing a tiredness that may be a result of the heat. It's soft, with candied blackberry and cherry flavors that finish dry, and is not ageworthy."
Merlot,"Hailing from the cool 2011 vintage, it's light in style with notes of red currant, herbs and olive with little apparent oak influence. A straight-forward easy quaffer."
Merlot,"Dark, ripe and concentrated, this voluptuous red offers loads of Merlot's characteristically plush plum and cherry flavors. It's also a deeply nuanced wine with pretty violet and chocolate notes mingling into spicy licorice and graphite. Richly textured, yet neatly balanced, it's drinking beautifully now but should hold well over the next decade."
Merlot,"This is fruity and clean, with plenty of pretty cherry-fruit flavor. A whiff of wood smoke and pipe tobacco carves its way through the fruit and into the finish."
Merlot,"Produced by the transfer method, with gas levels adjusted and a dosage the results in approximately 14g/L of sugar, this is a slightly mint and eucalypt-scented sparkler dominated by black cherries and coffee. Ends on a slightly dusty note. Multipe U.S. Importers."
Merlot,"This pure Merlot is racy, ripe and ready to drink, with fruit that shows maturity. Tannins are well integrated into the structure, leaving plenty of room for the juicy fruit and mature, spicy flavors. Drink now."
Merlot,"A big wine for Merlot, this high alcohol (14.6%) effort ramps up its black cherry fruit with volatile acidity and brings in chocolaty barrel flavors under an earthy, tannic finish. Another year or two in the bottle can only help; at this young age it seems a little blowsy and sharp."
Merlot,"Made from 100% Merlot, this shows the enormous fruit of Mount Veeder. The cherry and blackberry flavors are concentrated and pure, and there are liqueur-like notes of cassis and anise, plus a sweet toast accent from the oak. It's dry and quite tannic, but not to the extreme that it can't be consumed now."
Merlot,"From a site that reaches up to 1,800 feet and dates back grape-growing wise to before the Civil War, this wine is bold and beautiful. It's a study in dusty leather, black pepper and cigar, allowing sauvage, savory aspects to speak louder than fruit. Full bodied and robustly structured, it offers a memorable Tahitian-vanilla note on the finish."
Merlot,"A light, earthy wine, with violet, berry and tea flavors and a sharp, herbal note verging on grassiness or wet hay. It's very dry and the tannins are soft, but crisp acidity keeps it lively in the mouth."
Merlot,"There's a healthy 17% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Cabernet Franc in this wine, which is classically structured in red fruit, soft oak and peppery spice. Its cedar notes speak to the Cab within, while the overall texture and breadth of the wine is lengthy, food-ready and impressive."
Merlot,"This Merlot is strong and jammy in cherries and blackberries, with some herbs and spices for interest. It's dry and crisp, a nice wine for drinking now."
Merlot,"A soft acetone streak permeates the red cherry- and berry-driven bouquet, while red fruit and pomegranate flavors dominate the palate. A slightly twiggy herbal accent adds depth and staying power to the finish. Drink now."
Merlot,"The aromas on this wine are a bit weak, showing hints of licorice and a touch of blueberry. The palate offers dark red to purple fruit, with a touch of more bitter coffee grinds. The tannins are squeaky in texture."
Merlot,"Plusher and rounder than the Special Reserve bottling, Millbrook's standard label Merlot suggests soft red-cherry flavor accented with cocoa powder, savory mushroom and beetroot. Gentle acidity and fine-grained tannins accentuate its plump juicy feel. Drink now through 2019."
Merlot,"Clean and proper, if a bit soft and simple. Shows modest cherry-berry flavors with a touch of oak."
Merlot,"Cherry cough drop and other red fruit, medicinal aromas set up a standard, fresh palate with racy berry flavors and mild oak as a backdrop. Finishes with good smack, feel and controlled wood notes, but not much complexity or finesse."
Merlot,"Given extra time in bottle, this reserve-tier wine offers a generous layering of chocolate and blueberry flavor, the tannins soft and pillowy. Simple in its rich coconut and leather tones, it finishes without fuss."
Merlot,"One of the most important expressions of Merlot from southern Italy, Pàtrimo is a soft and decadent wine, boasting an excellent quality of ripe fruit that's backed by pretty tones of crushed stone, lead pencil and Indian spice. The mouthfeel is rich, generous and long lasting."
Merlot,"There's menthol on the nose of this light-bodied, unfussy red, memorable for its big, drying tannin and oak. Savory fruit is accompanied by a taste of soy."
Merlot,"Dried herbs, lots of spice and some black raspberry carry the bouquet. Fruit is front and center; the palate is all cherry and black pepper, and the finish brings more red fruit and firm tannins. It's mostly a one-song act, meaning it's clean, spicy and adequately fruity."
Merlot,"One of Argentina's few high-end Merlots, this opens with maple, toasty oak and deep berry aromas. With 9% Petit Verdot and Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc mixed in, this feels juicy, ripped and eminently healthy. Flavors of coffee, blackberry and cherry are deep and pure, while this avoids being overweight by tipping the scales at 13.9% abv. Drink through 2022."
Merlot,"A nice, fleshy young Merlot, vibrant and elegantly constructed. It's ready to drink now for its silky mouthfeel and dry, complex flavors of cherries, red currants, tobacco, herbs and cedar."
Merlot,"Smelling this wine is like entering a spice box: Saffron, cumin, cardamom and cinnamon all put in minute appearances. But the real protagonist is the wood, which still needs a few years to integrate, and the plump chocolate-covered cherries you get in the mouth. It's a thickly extracted wine with tight tannins: Drink after 2010."
Merlot,"Light in color, this wine offers aromas of herb, red currant, graphite, raspberry and barrel spice. The fruit and barrel flavors are elegantly styled, playing off each other through the finish."
Merlot,"Thin and weedy, with dill and oregano flavors and just a drop of cherry or blackberry fruit. Finishes dry and tannic."
Merlot,"This leads with plum, vanilla, barrel spice and herb aromas. The palate is soft and velvety, keeping the vineyard's often burly tannins well in check and providing a lot of textural appeal. Cocoa notes linger on the finish, delivering a yum factor that is hard to ignore."
Merlot,"Saint Clair has strayed from their Marlborough roots to source this Merlot from Hawke's Bay. The result boasts nicely ripe black cherry flavors, not overwhelmed by oak, finishing juicy and refreshing. Drink now."
Merlot,"Black olive stars in this supple, soft and supremely varietal wine, wrapped in strong, chalky tannin. Full bodied and completely generous in ripe fruit, it shows complexity and lengthiness on the finish."
Merlot,"Entirely estate-grown, 100% Merlot from old vines, this unfined wine is labeled vegan. Plush, briary, brambly fruit from the 30 year old vineyard brings an extra dimension to the wine, which shows a lovely balance of cranberry, raspberry, pie cherry and baking spice flavors. There's a hint of pastry crust in the finish, which is seamless and long. An absolute delight."
Merlot,"Far more tannic and closed down than most Oakville Bordeaux red wines, this Merlot's dry tannins are its main feature. It's tough, dry and astringent, with a core of black cherries, currants and smoky oak. But it shows promise. Try cellaring through 2012."
Merlot,"Juicy in red plum and layered in subtle suggestions of herb and cinnamon spice, this will please a wide range of palates and pocketbooks, the wine given a year in American oak. It's a good one for the dinner table or larger gathering."
Merlot,"Made from 100% Merlot grapes, this boasts ripe red berry, cassis, espresso, vanilla and chopped mint aromas. The densely concentrated palate doles out ripe cassis, licorice, tobacco and sage flavors, blanketed in velvety tannins. Drink through 2022."
Merlot,"Boysenberry and blueberry notes open this good value, straightforward red. The palate has the slightest grip and the finish is a bit longer than one has a right to expect at this price level."
Merlot,"Smoked meat, olives and mushroom lend a distinctly rustic flair to this late-release Merlot. Blackberry and cherry flavors are pristine and concentrated, but accented by hints of barnyard and astringent tannins that linger on the finish. Drink now through 2017."
Merlot,"This wine might knock your socks off with massively rich, ripe flavors of cherry pie, blueberry jam, mocha and toasty oak, wrapped into ultra-smooth tannins. For all the richness, it's brightened with just enough acidity for balance and finishes dry. There's no reason not to drink it now. Production was only 96 cases, but it's worth a search."
Merlot,"This 100% of Merlot from Tuscany opens with aromas of prune and raisin that recall uve passite or dried grapes. The palate offers concentrated fig, raisin and mocha and you'll also detect the warmth of evident alcohol. The overall lack of freshness makes this appear clunky and evolved."
Merlot,"Opulent fruit flavors and an almost thick texture make this delicious and dramatic. The aromas pop with blackberry and cherry, flavors resemble blueberry juice and the mouthfeel is rich and nicely tannic."
Merlot,"Pretty good Merlot, with varietally correct scents of black cherries and mocha leading into flavors of blue and black fruits. It's medium in body, with ample fruit and hints of chocolate and coffee on the finish."
Merlot,"This overpriced Merlot is tough and coarse. It has sweet berry and licorice flavors, with a bitter finish."
Merlot,"Aromas of sugared plum and other blue fruit take the lead followed by cocoa and herbs. The coffee and plum flavors are soft and sweet, going down easy."
Merlot,"There are lots of fresh, deeply flavored blackberries, blueberries and black currants in this wine. It's tough and gritty in tannins now, but it should benefit from a few years in the cellar."
Merlot,"Silverado's Merlot has been variable over the years. This '04 is fruit-driven, a soft, direct and appealing wine for its wealth of blackberry, cherry, plum, chocolate and leather flavors. Could develop bottle complexities with some time in the cellar."
Merlot,"This wine's aromas bring cherry and chocolate to mind. The palate provides pleasing fruit and barrel notes, but the two seem disconnected."
Merlot,"Showing hints of black cherry, chocolate, anise and herb flavors, this full-bodied wine is structured with firm, ripe tannins that lead to a supple finish. —J.M."
Merlot,"This leads with aromas of dark raspberries, toast and woodspice, seeming to still be in its shell. Flavors are high-octane, rich and sweet, with enough tannins to go the distance. It doesn't seem entirely integrated right now, but it will go up a notch or two if it comes together."
Merlot,"Light but relatively interesting aromas of black cherry, oregano, dill, pipe tobacco and cedar show shyly on the nose of this bottling. The shaved cedar is strong on the palate that is light in mouthfeel, and shows the same notes as the nose."
Merlot,"Gigantic, huge. Just erupts with the most intense cassis, chocolate and smoky new oak. Classic Howell Mountain structure, with dense, sweet young tannins and firm acidity. So immature, it's sappy and jammy now, and is sorely in need of cellaring. Don't touch before 2011, and should provide enjoyment for many years after."
Merlot,"Simple and cola-like, it has bright flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, with peppery, alcoholic heat, although it's basically dry. The weight is more like a rosé than a red, but it's pure and tasty."
Merlot,"Fairly stemmy on the nose, with herbaceous aromas. The palate blends green notes and candied plum flavors, while the finish is basic and a bit hot and grating. Tastes like a mass-market wine."
Merlot,"Lactic oak and rubbery black fruit aromas lead to a wiry, acidic palate. This is limited in its flavor range, with plum and berry flavors leading the way. An edgy feeling finish with plum and snappy acidity is not too demanding."
Merlot,"Meaty, dusty aromas of leather, cigar box, old books, roasted lamb, tobacco smoke and purple flowers make for a compelling nose on this wine. The palate is quite leathery, with beef crust, wood smoke and incense ash flavors, delivered in a smooth manner."
Merlot,"Vanilla, herb, pencil box and spice aromas are followed by sweet cherry flavors in this wine. Lightly tacky tannins provide support."
Merlot,"A rustic, simple wine, with ripe, sweet cherry and cola flavors. Feels rough and sharp in the mouth, but not bad for the price."
Merlot,"A Merlot with small percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this wine is sanguine and fairly thin, its streaks of tobacco and cedar not entirely decipherable."
Merlot,"Medium ruby in color, with already some slight bricking, this wine shows charred blackberry on the nose with ample green and black peppercorn. The palate follows suit offering a bit of structure from grainy, grippy tannins. Sweet herbs round out the finish."
Merlot,"Bedell continues to raise the bar for Long Island Merlot with this offering. A rich, savory nose of meat, leather spice and dark berry leads into a poised balance of savory spice, rich fruit, acids and tannins. The wine has a friendly brightness about it but overall, is restrained and integrated."
Merlot,"This is a good everyday wine if you're looking for something dry, full-bodied and fruity. It's not particularly identifiable as Merlot, but it's easy to drink, with berry and currant flavors and a nice tug from the tannins."
Merlot,"Deep red violet to the eye, this wine offers aromas of ripe cherry, pomegranate and orange zest. There is a sensation of coolness dominating fruit, with flavors of blackberry, pomegranate, menthol, clove and orange zest. It is a bit chewy on the palate; the strong tannins are crying out to be served alongside grilled lamb or beef."
Merlot,"Hot and crusty smelling at first blush and then the nose turns to mocha and smoky berry. Good mouthfeel, rich and balanced, with a fresh quality as well. Solid, complete red wine with a nice berry-packed Merlot character."
Merlot,"Bright and cheerful with a candied black cherry nose, this is a deliciously fruit-forward yet focused wine. On the palate, soft, fresh fruit and supple vanilla flavors meld beautifully with supple tannins and a rich, dark, roasted coffee finish."
Merlot,"Light and toasty, this is a pleasant, entry-level red wine with just a hint of chocolate in the finish. It's smooth and generic, but adds some spice and flesh once it's in the glass."
Merlot,"Trim and tannic, this distinctive effort mixes bright black cherry and cassis fruit with peppery herbs, notably rosemary. The balance is right on track, and the wine holds together through a medium-long finish."
Merlot,"84 Bridlewood 1999 Merlot (Central Coast); $22. Not a complete success due to notable vegetal notes suggesting those notorious South Coast asparagus. The acids and tannins are fine and so is the color. Most of the grapes came from Monterey, where the trick with Bordeaux varietals always is getting them ripe."
Merlot,"A rustic, barnyard aroma greets one on the nose before a basic taste of stewed prunes waltzes in."
Merlot,"Hints of sweet pastry introduce this bright, summery Merlot sparkling. Fun and fizzy, it fills the palate with rich, creamy mousse and sweet-tart strawberry-yogurt flavor."
Merlot,"Light fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry, along with some thin black cherry and cola flavors are what you'll find here. This is pleasant and drinkable, but not a wine to cellar or match with any really spicy foods. A good quaffer."
Merlot,"This 100% Merlot is fruit forward in cherry pie and chocolate flavors, it's hard to resist drinking it now. But it's also quite tannic. The overall depth and balance strongly suggest that it will hold, and possibly develop, over the next four years."
Merlot,"This wine opens with ripe aromas of black plum and boysenberry fruit, accented by hints of licorice root and menthol. The fruity core continues to shine on the smooth, round palate, alongside accents of purple violet, black tea and oak-driven spice that linger through the close."
Merlot,"The blend includes 6% Syrah, and the wine has a pretty plum and blueberry color, that (perhaps by the power of suggestion) carries through into the aromas. It's tight, tart, and clean, offering a mix of berry fruits and a finish lined with vanilla and tobacco. Overall the balance is excellent, the wine juicy and fresh, and the blend just about perfect."
Merlot,"This wine's plum, vanilla, milk chocolate and blue fruit aromas are followed by a palate saturated with supersmooth fruit and barrel flavors. The variety isn't immediately apparent, but it's delicious all the same."
Merlot,"A mild current of cinnamon, clove and tobacco provide a spicy entry into this wine, backed up by a fruity mid-palate. Medium weight and body give it some power and substance, while on the finish, it comes under an herbaceous light."
Merlot,"Pretty hard to like. It's harsh in acidity, with watered-down raspberry jam flavors that finish sweet."
Merlot,"This Merlot is very fruity and forward with persistent berry jam, cassis, anise and mocha flavors. Although the tannins are brisk, it's a wine to drink now."
Merlot,"The nose on this layered Merlot offers dark cherry, cocoa and spice aromas. Cedar, cigarbox, cherry and chocolate on the palate are balanced with a clean, chalky mouthfeel. The wine can age but has appeal now, and a serious focus."
Merlot,"Shows the classic Kunde signature of pure, intense Merlot, at a good price. Soft and ripe with cherries, licorice and mocha, it's a gentle, easy wine to drink now."
Merlot,"Desiderio, a legendary Italian Merlot, shows slightly sour aromas this vintage with cherry, pressed flowers, natural rubber and spice. It's a hearty, well-concentrated wine with loads of density and intense cherry fruit on the close."
Merlot,"Keenan has a good track record with Merlot, and here's a lovely one. It's softly approachable despite firm tannins, with flavors of cherries, blackberries and cola, and an earthy note that suggests mushroom risotto."
Merlot,"The aromas are meaty yet undefined. In the mouth, the fruit seems snappy and overly excited. The acidity is a bit out of control and it leads to questionable balance. Still the raspberry and cherry flavors are good, and the oak shadings seem about right."
Merlot,"A huge, fruit-packed wine, made in the Shafer style of mass and potency. With 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and lots of new oak, it's explosive in black cherry, cherry liqueur and cedar flavors, with a spicy, salty umami taste, like pepperoni. Give it a decant of several hours."
Merlot,"The wine opens with a pretty ruby appearance and follows through with aromas of blue flower, lavender, red apple skin, cola, root beer and vanilla. In fact, it shares few characteristics with your standard Merlot."
Merlot,"The Hyatt is tight, hard and chewy. Its stiff tannins are calling the shots, and leaving an earthy impression strongly tasting of roots and stems through a somewhat bitter finish. —P.G."
Merlot,"A balanced and well-structured wine, this Merlot expresses attractive aromas of black plum, soft sweet licorice and delicate spice. The mouth is lush and round with soft tannins and a chocolaty finish. Drink now."
Merlot,"This is a wine on the cusp of being mature. The red-berry flavors are dissipating into a secondary aromatic character. The tannins, though, are still there—very firm and showing no sign of budging. Wait and see, or decant before drinking. This is part of a single-parcel (lieu-dit)single-varietal range."
Merlot,"Pointed, sharp aromas leave an angular bouquet. The rest of the wine is jumpy, furry and a bit funky, with pointed plum and raspberry flavors and then a toasty, oaky finish with bitterness, heat and leftover butter flavors."
Merlot,"This wine, from selected vineyards owned by the Carrille family, is rich and now mature. Its tannins are merging with the secondary flavors of the fruit as it softens and develops a spice and tobacco character. Drink this wine now."
Merlot,"Aromas of plum, blueberry, vanilla and spice are followed by plush, ample fruit flavors. It brings a lot of appeal, with baking-spice flavors lingering on the finish."
Merlot,"Soft and simple, but the price makes it a pretty good value. Shows cherry, violet, cocoa and smoky oak flavors in a smooth package that finishes dry and spicy."
Merlot,"A real success, this 100% Merlot, sourced from the Stillwater Creek and Conner Lee vineyards, is exotically scented with a rich mix of baking spices, coffee, dust, pencil lead and cedar. Lots of oak influence, but it plays well against the tart and mellow berry flavors. There is a suggestion of dried leaf, perhaps an indication of older vines."
Merlot,"Impressively rich, velvety and long, this appears to have all the ingredients for cellaring. Ample oak supports and elevates the fruit-derived notes of cherry preserves, dark chocolate and black olives, while lending hints of cedar, vanilla and mocha. Drink this remarkable effort 2020–2030."
Merlot,"The Celilo vineyard, located on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge appellation, is one of the most unique in the region. This ripe, almost liquorous Merlot is bursting with sappy cherry fruit, buttressed with tangy acids. The structure is here to more than support the weight of the wine and its alcohol, just under 15%. Barrel flavors of bourbon and vanilla dominate the finish."
Merlot,"The somewhat prominent herb aromas don't seem varietal. The red-fruit flavors are considerably more germane, though the tannins come off as a bit sticky."
Merlot,"Blackberry and spice aromas are earthy, leathery and stalky. This is youthful and tannic at this point, while oaky flavors of clove and wood spice ride heavily atop blackberry and dark plum fruit. Oak notes and firm tannins indicate that this will be best from late 2015 through 2018."
Merlot,"Whiffs of barnyard and bramble lend rusticity to this wine, contrasted by fresher, prettier notes of rose petal and blackberry jam. It's a charming Merlot marked by crisp black-fruit flavor, sprightly acidity and dusty, lingering tannins."
Merlot,"Despite coming from the even-keeled 2012 vintage, this nearly 100% varietal wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with notes of green pepper, herbs and bittersweet chocolate. It's medium bodied with sweet cherry and clove flavors."
Merlot,"If you're looking for a rich, delightful, full-bodied red wine to drink now, try this Merlot. It's upfront in red cherry, currant, cola, mocha and spice flavors, wrapped into soft, fine tannins. A blend of fruit from some of Napa Valley's best vineyards."
Merlot,"This is a nice, smooth Merlot, perfect for everyday drinking. It's dry and rich in tannins, with blackberry, currant, smoked meat and oak flavors."
Merlot,"Dark in color, this delivers black fruit aromas along with a toasty note. While it's slightly hollow in the middle, it's wide around the edges, tasting of mossy blackberry and herb. The finish is toasty, big and grabby."
Merlot,"Tastes just like a cherry coke, with the heat of alcohol and smoky spice of oak. That's a pleasant, even complex mélange of flavors, even though the structure is simple and direct."
Merlot,"Tastes jammy sweet and bubble gummy, with the gassiness of a Beaujolais Nouveau. It's more full-bodied than that, of course, with black cherry flavors."
Merlot,"A young wine from a high-acid year, and it's showing a fair amount of earth and green, herbal flavor. The fruit seems just on the edge of ripe, with hints of brambly berry. Well balanced in a tough year."
Merlot,"Lightweight and easy in the mouth, with bright, juicy red fruit aromas and flavors spiced up by olive tapenade and fruitcake accents. Clean and balanced with a medium-length finish."
Merlot,"From grapes grown at this estate and vinified by the Tutiac cooperative in Blaye on the north bank of the Gironde Estuary, this wine is easy, soft and fruity. With black-currant fruit and acidity, it reflects the fruitiness of the vintage and is likely to be ready to drink soon. Drink from late 2017."
Merlot,"Soft and friendly, this has instantly likeable cherry, cola, anise and sandalwood flavors. Perfect for drinking now."
Merlot,"There is an elegant integration of aromas on the nose of this bottling, with black cherry, smoked beef and a touch of tobacco. The mouthfeel is very soft and full, presenting flavors of blueberry, crushed asphalt and tart black plum skin. A solid sipper now, it's likely to improve with some aging."
Merlot,"A much more concentrated version of the regular bottling. The fruit is still raspberries and cherries, but there is more focus and power, and it’s wrapped in smooth milk chocolate. A flat-out delicious bottle of Merlot."
Merlot,There is nothing wimpy about this 100% pure Merlot. The firm core of tart berry and currant adds iron and clove highlights through a concentrated midpalate; the finish is a bit rough and hints at green tannins.
Merlot,"Though Syrah makes up only 14% of this wine, it seems to take over the show with its notes of plum and smoke playing against barrel accents of pencil lead and vanilla. It drinks off dry (9.5g/L residual sugar), with dry grainy tannins."
Merlot,"This full-bodied Merlot opens with aromas that recall cedar, licorice, mature plum and blackberry that follow through to the robust palate, alongside cracked peppercorn, clove and tobacco. Firm but velvety tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2018."
Merlot,"This appellation has shown great promise with the variety and this wine demonstrates why. Aromas and flavors of dried and baked plum center on a juicy, soft core, accented in pencil shavings and cedar. Red cherries and a long finish complement the whole."
Merlot,"A modest wine that has much to be modest about. It's dry and rather simple, with candied cherry-berry, cola and spice flavors."
Merlot,"An element of menthol-cinnamon chewing gum shows on the nose of this wine, grown at high elevations above the Sonoma Valley. High-pitched acidity buoys velvety red fruit, with a clay-like flavor and texture to the tannins."
Merlot,"Feels classy and vital from the very start and all the way through. Lots of ripe, complex, bone-dry blackberry, cherry, cola, cassis, herb, chocolate and cedar flavors that finish long and spicy. Even nearing five years of age, the tannins are significant, giving the wine a tough astringency. Hard to tell if the fruit will outlast the tannins. If you drink now, give it a good, long decant."
Merlot,"This is a pretty nice wine. It's made in a lighter style than from warmer regions, and is silky, absolutely dry and crisp in acids. The cherry, berry and currant flavors are perfectly integrated with the oak. Drink this elegantly constructed, food-friendly wine now."
Merlot,"From a producer that knows its way around the variety, this Reserve-tier wine shows off its burly pedigree in leather and tobacco, strapped around huge tannins. Crisper, high-toned red fruit makes itself felt midway through on the palate, finishing in handfuls of distinct black pepper."
Merlot,"With no added sulfur, this ripe, young wine is broad with spice and some firm tannins. Its berry flavors are still dominated by the structure. Drink from 2018."
Merlot,"This is a strong wine from this region just south of Temecula and north of San Diego. The nose offers smoked cigar, blackberry preserves, raw cut wood and pine-needle aromas, while the palate packs juniper and floral tea elements into a black-plum backbone. Hints of soy and burned caramel add action to the medium-weight mouthfeel."
Merlot,"A vivid, fresh and fragrant wine, this is alive with a luscious mix of flavors from the intriguing mix of grapes, including Syrah, Dolcetto and Barbera. Lots of strawberry, sweet cherry candy and lively, juicy acids make this a standout. There are more and more well-made red blends selling at this price point in Washington, but this goes right to the top."
Merlot,"Fairly hard on the nose, with a hint of plastic and then raspberry and plum aromas rising as it settles. The palate shows decent zest and body along with narrow flavors of berry and pepper. Finishes with mild intensity and a note of saline."
Merlot,"Raspberry, cocoa, coffee and vanilla aromas lead to plump, focused fruit flavors. It's both appealing and quite varietally correct. For those looking for a quality value Merlot, look no further."
Merlot,"Blended with a little Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah, this is a soft, sweet, peppery Merlot, filled with luscious, warm-climate flavors of black cherries, raspberries and chocolate. There's a lot of sweet, smoky oak, too. Drink up."
Merlot,"Soft and sweet, with a liqueur taste of raisins and crême de cassis. Dry, but hot. The official alcohol reading of 14.5% by volume tastes suspiciously low."
Merlot,"This offers assertive aromas and flavors of banana, strawberry bubblegum, watermelon and blueberry. The palate is lightweight and fruity, with a sharp acidic edge and a short, fleeting finish."
Merlot,"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage this wine offers a blue-fruit profile seldom seen in the state for this variety along with notes of chocolate and coffee. It's elegantly styled with a soft feel, trailing toward the finish."
Merlot,"Clay and minty cola aromas give nuance to the soft, dark, perfectly ripe blueberry fruit on the nose of this wine. Fine-grained but sticky tannins and a pinch of acidity frame the sip, where dark-roast espresso, beef char and cigar smoke flavors reign."
Merlot,"Olallieberry, cedar and lacquered-wood aromas show on the nose of this bottling from a winery based in the Russian River Valley. There is a decently structured tannic chalkiness to the palate, with flavors of black cherry, vanilla and pepper."
Merlot,"Slightly granular smelling and seemingly oversized on the bouquet. In the mouth it folds itself back into standard form, with earthy, jammy flavors of wild berry and spice. Seems a touch heavy and slightly green on the finish, but overall it gets the job done."
Merlot,"Made entirely with Merlot, this isn't very expressive, offering aromas and flavors that suggest black-skinned fruit along with whiffs of tangerine and baking spice. It's extremely simple, with loose-knit tannins. Drink soon."
Merlot,"The flavors in this Merlot are exceptionally ripe with cherries, red currants, red plums, mocha and new oak, and the tannins are rich and refined. High alcohol gives it a heat that makes it uncomfortable."
Merlot,"Made from Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc grown in the warm Happy Canyon region of the valley, this shows the greatness of the 2007 vintage. It's ready to drink, bearing soft, gentle tannins that frame flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate, vanilla and sweet, smoky oak."
Merlot,"Earthy aromas of tilled soil, truffle, leather, black cherry and cedar lead the nose on this rich but elegant wine. The concentrated, smooth palate delivers juicy blackberry, black currant, freshly ground peppercorn, licorice, milk chocolate and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. Stunning and delicious, it's already drinking beautifully but it will also maintain for years. Drink through 2025."
Merlot,"The aromas of cinnamon, kelp, and dried fruit are unusual and don't seem in harmony. The gamy flavors bring some appeal but don't entirely come together."
Merlot,"Lighter in color, this blend of Conner Lee, Red Mountain Vineyard and Elephant Mountain fruit has aromas of freshly brewed coffee, dark chocolate, toasty barrel spices and red fruit, with the barrel notes taking the lead. It's silky-soft in feel, with generous raspberry flavors that show a pleasing sense of balance, all backed by a light squeeze of tannins."
Merlot,"A precise note of crème de cassis is met with dense aromas of herbal relish, spiced toast and raisin purée. It feels medium to full bodied, with an open texture and dark, sun-baked flavors."
Merlot,"Tastes more like Cabernet, with black currant flavors and sturdy tannins, but the point is that it's a nice, dry, full-bodied table wine. The brand's been around for a while and is proving to be a consistent good value."
Merlot,"Harmonious on the nose and palate with ripe black plums and cassis enveloped by a layer of char and smoke. Medium to full bodied with structured acidity, it's a straightforward but sound Merlot with powdery, soft tannins and a tasty black cherry and graham cracker finish."
Merlot,"Spicy, forest berry aromas are slightly herbal, but familiar and reassuring. In the mouth, this basic Merlot shows structure and balance. Flavors of herbal blackberry, fig and chocolate finish with lasting minty, oaky notes."
Merlot,"This is a beautiful red wine to drink now for its rich, ripe flavors and overall balance. It's soft in acids and fine in tannins, offering heady waves of black cherries, currants and chocolate. Easy to find, with nearly 75,000 cases produced."
Merlot,"This light-colored and light-bodied wine combines an earthy, metallic aroma with mildly fruity, candied flavors. Its texture is mild and smooth."
Merlot,"This is a light-bodied and full-flavored wine with a good, gripping texture and plenty of ripe plum and black pepper aromas. A fruity and beefy flavor carries through the finish."
Merlot,"Shafer's Cabernet is so dominant, it's sometimes forgotten how good their Merlot can be. The wines are dependably dry, rich and balanced, as the excellent '05 demonstrates. It's soft and drinkable now, but rich and sweet in tannins that frame cherry, currant, cola, licorice and vanilla flavors. Will reward cellaring through 2011."
Merlot,"Nelson Neves has made a rich wine, recognizably Portuguese in its tannic structure while also having a jammy, juicy red-fruit character that comes from the Merlot. This ripe wine is ready to drink."
Merlot,"Leather, dried cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sagebrush aromas are woven into a decent if not entirely lively nose. Lots of chopped fresh and dried herbs arise once sipped, along with gravel, black fruit and sticky tannins."
Merlot,"This opens with a familiar taste of artificial, roasted char, then it moves on to soupy berry aromas. It feels scratchy, with flavors of hickory, baked plum and berry."
Merlot,"While soft on the nose with a generous dose of cooked black fruit, Jamesport's Bloc E is surprisingly crisp and lean on the palate. Pristine red fruit shines amidst layers of mocha, spice and forest floor, finishing on a grippy, darkly toasted wood note."
Merlot,"This wine offers a somewhat untoward combination of herbs, nori, tire rubber and blue fruit. Flavors are sharp-edged backed by chalky tannins."
Merlot,"The plum, herb and spice aromas are followed by ever so slightly dried-out-seeming cherry flavors. There's enjoyment to be had, but it seems slightly more evolved than its age indicates."
Merlot,"As sweet as a dessert wine, with sugary raspberry, cherry and spice flavors."
Merlot,"Shows an aggressive, roasted set of aromas that feature leather, meat, olive and char. The palate is full and thick, with chewy, flat tannins and then herbal flavors that mute the wine's black fruit content. A good midlevel wine that delivers within its price range."
Merlot,"Dark chocolate and rich plum sauce add complexity to this black fruit-driven Merlot. Blackberry preserves and soft plum guts fill the mouth, with a touch of green pepper appearing on the finish. Medium weight with a creamy texture and a medium-length finish. Drink now."
Merlot,"A simple, everyday red that won't break the bank. The grapes tend to get a little baked this far inland, especially Merlot, which really needs just the right conditions to maintain delicacy and balance. As a result the dominant notes are earthy, with a slightly baked or raisiny quality. The tannins, needless to say, are soft, and the acidity is low."
Merlot,"This shows the softness and red cherry flavors of a nice Merlot, with rich Napa tannins and a hint of green mint. It's a clean, dry wine for drinking now."
Merlot,"Light dried herbs, cigar box and cranberry aromas arise on the nose of this bottling from the Broken Earth team. It's zesty on the sip, with raspberry and cooked red-plum flavors that are spiced up by pepper and more dried herbs. It's a tad thin."
Merlot,"This is still the current release. A very hot vintage in Washington, it leads with a Portlike nose of raisins and prunes; follows with soft, ripe and roasted flavors. The tannins are deep and earthy. Drink now. —P.G."
Merlot,"A sharp, rustic wine, sweet in sugary raspberry, cherry and crunchy almond granola flavors."
Merlot,"This new project by a former White House videographer recently enlisted Paul Hobbs as a consultant. The promise is already apparent in this wine, with aromas of cedar, cherry extract and pleasant green-pepper elements. Spicy black pepper leads the palate, which finds ripeness in black cherry and balance with leather and coffee."
Merlot,"If you think you don't like Merlot, try this one. It shows classic Napa Valley structure, with smooth, firm tannins and seductive flavors of sweet cherries, plums and currants. Delicious now with a good steak."
Merlot,"Whether by virtue of vintage or bottle variation, Boudreaux wines seem to gyrate a bit wildly when first released. This new 2005 is no exception. At first sniff it explodes into life, the aromas a mix of herb, spice, tar, smoke, earth and fruit. Flavors are threaded together into a seamless, saturated whole—plum, cassis and cherry liqueur up front, earth and tannin right behind. Some tasters may find it leaning toward the medicinal, but for those who love Rob Newsom's full-speed-ahead style, this is a gorgeous bottle."
Merlot,"A minor wine, dry, tannic and awkward, with modest cherry, cola and oak flavors. Okay for everyday drinking, but not going anywhere."
Merlot,"This pure Merlot coats the mouth with opulent berry and cherry fruit and silky tannins. Crafted from Ciel du Cheval, Conner Lee and Stonetree vineyard grapes, the poise, balance, integration and persistence are outstanding, as is the value."
Merlot,"Big, awkward aromas of red fruit and oak are followed by simple berry and plum flavors and even more overt oak. The finish is big and warm, while late in the game the wine turns tangy. This is one of many mass-market Merlots with few glaring faults; but still it fights to rise above basic acceptability."
Merlot,"Pure Merlot from the Red Willow vineyard, this does not skimp on the scents and flavors of green herb. It's true to the vineyard's style and will require further bottle age to flesh out a bit and show its best strengths."
Merlot,"This shows a strong Bourbon barrel flavor from the new oak that is still being integrated into the fruit. Tart wild-berry flavors surfacewith air, but the impression is of a high-acid, sharply-defined Merlot; it's structured for aging."
Merlot,"Seriously structured, this wine is almost too rich. It is concentrated, with dense tannins, dark chocolate and cocoa flavors. The juicy, jammy black fruits come with the acidity to give the wine some welcome crispness and fruitiness. Drink from 2020."
Merlot,"Overly ripe and sugary sweet, this Merlot, with a splash of Cab, has a rustic feeling. There is ripe fruit and fine tannins, but the sweetness is a problem."
Merlot,"Ungainly, with stiff, puckery tannins giving a hard astringency, and unintegrated oak sticking out. Somewhere inbetween are modest cherry, anise and herb flavors. Pretty good, but not likely to go anywhere, so drink now."
Merlot,"A full, spicy wine, with weight from wood and attractive fruits. There is a touch of stalkiness here, a sign of the vintage, but the wine is maturing well in a food-friendly way."
Merlot,"Full-bodied and richly textured, this ultradark, concentrated Merlot makes a statement. Toast and vanilla shadings mark the bold cassis fruit, which glides easily into a long, velvety finish tinged with mocha. Drink now–2020—and possibly beyond, as this should prove to be a long-lived example."
Merlot,"Deep ruby to the eye, this wine offers rich aromas of cherry, black licorice and orange rind and flavors of blackberry, black cherry, cassis, anisette and eucalyptus. Long-lasting tannins coat the mouth but there is always a sense of fresh fruit on the palate and a brightness that lingers right into the satisfying finish."
Merlot,"Light, smoky aromas and juicy, fruity flavors make this medium-bodied wine easy to enjoy. From a breezy delta vineyard, it's neither big nor overtly oaky but well-balanced and smooth in texture."
Merlot,"Despite the almost syrupy fruit and alcohol pushing 16%, the fruit scents are less than optimal, suggesting that perhaps the grapes were pushed too far. Along with notes of plant material, the alcoholic heat mars the finish."
Merlot,"This dry Merlot is marked by strong tannins and ripe fruit. It shows bursts of black cherry, currant, cola and cedar flavors, and it has an astringent texture that's unlikely to age away. Drink now."
Merlot,"This is the kind of wine Franciscan produces so well and reliably. As far as Merlots go, it shows the soft approachability and supple tannins you expect. Flavorwise, it's appealing in ripe red cherries, sweet red licorice and smoky oak. A very nice restaurant wine, and easy to find, with more than 20,000 cases produced."
Merlot,"Reedy plum and raspberry aromas are a touch floral. This feels highly regular, while medicinal berry flavors carry a mild green and weedy side note. A finish with modest raspberry and cherry notes is par for the course."
Merlot,"A pure expression of Merlot, this round, delicious wine opens with aromas of blueberry, blackberry, leather, licorice and tobacco. The juicy, smooth palate doles out fleshy black cherry, plum, mint, menthol and anise. Soft, velvety tannins give it a creamy texture. Drink through 2019."
Merlot,"Sweet-tasting, jammy raspberry and cherry flavors abound in this Merlot. It should be easy to drink with burgers, enchiladas or ribs slathered in barbecue sauce."
Merlot,"This wine has the weight and silkiness of a Pinot Noir, but it has Merlot's cherry, currant and anise flavors."
Merlot,"This has a lovely entry that explodes with scents of toasted almond and espresso. The black cherry and sour plum flavors command your attention, with texture and balance throughout. Drink soon."
Merlot,"This lively Merlot from Coastal Tuscany conveys aromas of blackberry, spice and a whiff of underbrush. The juicy palate offers crushed black cherry, red currant and a note of white pepper alongside soft tannins. Enjoy it soon to capture the fresh fruit sensations."
Merlot,"Dark in color, this delivers black fruit aromas along with a toasty note. While it's slightly hollow in the middle, it's wide around the edges, tasting of mossy blackberry and herb. The finish is toasty, big and grabby."
Merlot,"This is the producer's inaugural offering of the variety, made in tiny amounts, but boy oh boy, it's good. Bright blue and black-berry succulence exude vibrancy and freshness on the palate complemented by savory hints of tar, black licorice and char. Velvety soft tannins allow the fruit to speak."
Merlot,"This blush wine shows plenty of Merlot fruit in the form of cherries and raspberries. It's slightly sweet to off-dry, with pleasant acidity providing balance."
Merlot,"A complex opening of leather, plum, vanilla and gingerbread leads to a crisp palate with intense cherry notes. Lacks the multi-dimensionality of a top wine but the touches of youthful fruit on the medium finish are guaranteed to charm. Drink now."
Merlot,"Very, very ripe in blackberries, currants and prunes, with oak elaborations. The flavors are rich, but the wine is a bit lacking in structure and depth of interest. Drink now."
Merlot,"Barrel notes of spice, vanilla, caramel and herbs lead to red- and blue-fruit flavors, with the tannins showing some astringency. Merlot wouldn't be a first guess but it still brings appeal."
Merlot,"Bright cherry and spice color this luminous Merlot that delivers power and definition and is not too weighed down by oak. In fact, this Sicilian red is sprightly and fresh with sweet cherry flavors on the close."
Merlot,Pleasing aromas of raspberry jam and spice lead to soft plump raspberry and cranberry flavors. It's fruit forward and brings a lot of enjoyment.
Merlot,"With an amazing alcohol level of 16.6%, this Merlot is as hot as a chile pepper. But the flavors are enormously rich and flamboyant, suggesting ripe cherry and raspberry jam. Ready now."
Merlot,"Supple and balanced, this 100% Merlot brings ripe berries and cherries  matched to moderate acids and silky tannins. It's a ready-to-go, pleasant-drinking young wine, with a whiff of Earl Grey tea and light loam in the tannins."
Merlot,There's a stubbornly vegetal streak to this Merlot. It pops out in the aroma and lasts through the flavors of cherry pie and raspberry sour candy. Ready to drink now.
Merlot,"Well integrated charred oak melds well with ripe blackberry and black plum aromas in this blend of Merlot from a cooperative of Long Island winemakers. This is a full-bodied wine with an intensely concentrated black fruit character, a kick of earthy, barnyard funk and firm, structured tannins."
Merlot,"Though labeled as Merlot, this smells more like Syrah which makes up 20% of the blend, with aromas of blue and purple fruit along with whiffs of smoked meat and dried herb. The fruit flavors are sweet and plump, backed by soft, luxurious tannins. It's enjoyable but doesn't seem varietally correct."
Merlot,"Dark and extracted, with jammy berry flavors and a strongly earthy component, including tobacco, sage and tree bark. In the mouth this wine is very dry and pretty tannic, although the acidity is soft. A bit awkward, and not likely to improve in the cellar."
Merlot,"These vineyards seem to have been selected for unripe, vegetal grapes. Just manages to scrape by with a veneer of cherries."
Merlot,"Pàtrimo, a pure expression of Merlot from southern Italy, is always a crowd pleaser, but this year's edition is a tad more ripe and jammy than past vintages: 2005 was indeed a hot year. Intense aromas of black cherry and blackberry pie emerge from the nose and the wine's finish is accented by a surprise signature of tart acidity."
Merlot,"A rather ordinary Merlot, dry and rugged, with jammy-fruity flavors of cherries, herbs and oak. Blended with Beckstoffer Cabernet Sauvignon, which gives it needed body and power."
Merlot,"A bit shy, but some air will help coax out aromas of vanilla and cherry jam. The palate has medium acid and the faintest whiff of tannins while some leather and horse notes come out on the short-to-medium finish. Well done in an easy-drinking, crowd-pleasing style."
Merlot,"Pleasing aromas of cocoa, dried herb and red fruit lead to a full-bodied palate with a tight core of grippy tannins. Vanilla and spice notes run throughout."
Merlot,"Rustic and medium-bodied, this Merlot has a nice spiciness that would be a big hit at a backyard barbecue. There's some char on the nose, and a spicy-marinade note on the palate. Finishes with dryish tannins and outdoorsy, tree-bark flavors."
Merlot,"This Yakima Valley Merlot is forward and light, with a dried leaf character complementing the fruit flavors of melon and strawberry. A peppery note strikes home in the finish, with just a hint of Band-Aid."
Merlot,"Burly and brawny in tar and leather, this muscular wine is showy and yet totally delicious. It's worthwhile and hard to resist in its full embrace of smoky oak, black-cherry liqueur and blackberry jam. Soft and succulent, it finishes as robust as it started—a good poster child for the oft-maligned variety."
Merlot,"This dark-colored Merlot offers reduced berry, chocolate and herbal aromas. In the mouth, it's displaying rubbery tannins. Dried berry and oak-based flavors of spice and wood grain finish with hints of clove on a finish that could use more harmony and depth."
Merlot,"A subtle nose of smoke and spice leads into flavors of smoke, slightly tart berry and spice on this affordable South African Merlot. Smooth tannins and a soft finish give the wine an everyday, food-friendly feel."
Merlot,"Herb, pencil lead, plum and vanilla aromas are followed by smooth, soft blue-fruit flavors. It shows a beautiful sense of balance."
Merlot,"Slight smoke and dark plum, a hint of polished mahogany and the merest touch of leather suggest restrained elegance and complexity. The palate is just medium-bodied but of such subtle balance that the entire wine becomes utterly seductive even though heat is palpable. There are dark, brooding elements of fruit that play above the taut, grippy but fine structure. What a distinguished, beautiful rendition of Merlot."
Merlot,"There's lots to admire in this well-ripened, elegant dinner wine. It has aromas of green olives, white chocolate, and plums, with a waft of smoky oak, while the flavors are spicy and fruity. Bone-dry, it's richly tannic and complex, with depth and interest."
Merlot,"This medium-bodied wine smells sugary and floral, but tastes quite dry. Flavors are fruity but spare and the mouthfeel is taut."
Merlot,"This is a dry, tannic and somewhat earthy Merlot. The structure is impeccably elegant, and there's a wealth of herb-infused blackberry and currant fruit flavor that makes it rewarding."
Merlot,"Enough berry and plum richness and smoky oak to satisfy fussy drinkers, yet dry and compact, with a nice shine of acidity. Not too complex or subtle, but there's plenty to like about it. Should be easy to find with more than 30,000 cases produced."
Merlot,"Long maturation in French oak lends a distinctly nutty, smoky tone to this brambly berried Merlot. While bold in body and a touch warm in alcohol, its ripe black-fruit flavors are sharpened by cranberry acidity and firm, penetrating tannins. A hint of cocoa powder lingers on the finish."
Merlot,"This is classic Washington Merlot, with flesh and a full-bodied middle. It offers a generous palate of cherries and berries, trailing into light tannins with a streak of green tea and coffee. The wine is balanced and bright, with lightly lifted aromas and a solid midpalate."
Merlot,"French oak, coconut, cassis, menthol and coffee aromas lead the nose of this structured red. Made entirely from Merlot, it's densely concentrated, offering mature plum, black currant, dried sage, anise and espresso flavors. Firm, close-grained tannins give the finish grip. Drink 2018–2025."
Merlot,"Saucy tomato and herbal berry aromas are a bit green. This feels creamy and thick, but also bumpy. Oaky, herbal black-fruit flavors are a touch stewy. It tastes green, minty and herbal on the finish."
Merlot,"Made in a style that will appeal to Cabernet Sauvignon fans, this full-bodied wine is thickly layered, packed in blueberry and plum with a slap of toasty oak on the backside. With a leathery, rounded texture, it sparks in spicy vanilla as it goes down."
Merlot,"Spicy cinnamon comes to the fore in this Merlot that's also complete in plum and currant. Soft and round, the wine is approachable and not overdone, aged in 30% new American oak."
Merlot,"Inky redviolet to the eye, this wine has a nose of chocolate covered espresso bean, cherry and raspberry. Restrained tannins provide a backdrop for flavors of black cherry, mocha, raspberry, and mint. There is a good balance of fruit and cooling herb flavors, while berry flavors hold their own and linger on the palate through the mint-heavy finish."
Merlot,"Reale (100% Merlot) offers sweet cherry and raspberry aromas with light touches of spice and toasted almond in the background. This ruby colored wine offers an easy, fresh and lean feel in the mouth."
Merlot,"There's much to enjoy with this wine's aromas of vanilla, coffee, baking spices, raspberry and green wood. The sweet flavors show cranberry-like tartness and grainy tannins."
Merlot,"This is the best of the new releases from Seven Bridges, a Portland-based winery with a penchant for Washington State fruit. Smooth, balanced and mouth-filling, this offers a truffle highlight that sits over the bright berry and cherry flavors."
Merlot,"Reale (100% Merlot) offers sweet cherry and raspberry aromas with light touches of spice and toasted almond in the background. This ruby colored wine offers an easy, fresh and lean feel in the mouth."
Merlot,"This is a delicious Merlot for drinking now. It's Martin Ray's best in years, a dry, smooth, soft wine, with elaborate cherry pie, blackberry jam and oak flavors that are complex and spicy."
Merlot,An inexpensive Merlot that's herbal. It also shows cranberry and menthol amid a light toasting of oak.
Merlot,"Initially it gives off murky, soupy aromas. But with airing it rounds into form, displaying prune and oak scents in front of a round, soft, stewy palate of chunky berry flavors. Gets better with time before finishing with toast, herbal notes and tobacco. Offers more highs than lows."
Merlot,"This is a simple wine with a touch of menthol and astringency, a mix of dried herb and grapes picked at an early stage of ripeness."
Merlot,"Though Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc each make up just 3% of this wine, they seem to show themselves aromatically, with herb and floral notes that provide the backdrop for Merlot's cocoa and cherry. The red fruit flavors are plump and juicy, backed by bright acid that leads to a long, fruit filled finish. It doesn't always come off as completely varietal but it's nearly impossible to resist all the same."
Merlot,"For the price, this Merlot packs a delicious punch, offering soft, persistent layers of chocolate, tar and leather, the tannins present yet well-managed. Red fruit and smoke intermingle on the palate, playing well together."
Merlot,"Intense and extracted, with vanilla and char aromas upfront and cherry schnapps flavors in the mouth. Smooth tannins suggest a lean meat such as veal cutlets. Drink now to 2011."
Merlot,"Subdued herb, red fruit and spice aromas are followed by quite reserved cherry and berry flavors. It displays a lot of restraint."
Merlot,"At four years of age, this Merlot is as good as it will ever be. It's rustic in texture, with some sharp edges, and ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors."
Merlot,"Very reliable and rewarding for everyday drinking, this wine packs lush black cherries, well-integrated purple flowers, savory roasted beef and touches of salted caramel and oak into the nose. Cooked blueberries, caramel and French-toast flavors show on the palate."
Merlot,"Narrow, forward black cherry aromas are dark and positive. It's a bit choppy and showing acidity on the palate, with plum, red berry and additional edgy zest. Flows fast and direct due to its bright fruit and lively acids. A good everyday red wine that's tasty and charged up."
Merlot,"Smells vegetal and unripe, with broccoli aromas that turn medicinal sweet in the mouth."
Merlot,"This wine offers abundant aromas of vanilla, coconut shavings, mocha and dried cherries. It's luscious with generous fruit and barrel flavors, with the barrel notes winning out and taking over on the vanilla-dominated finish."
Merlot,"Burnt and herbal plum and berry aromas are just good enough. This feels clampy due to hard tannins. Medicinal plum and cherry flavors come with a forced-oak element, while this is dry and tannic on a hollow finish."
Merlot,"Harsh, with rough tannins and sweet and sour cherry flavors."
Merlot,"Sanguine in black olive tapenade, this is a soft, smooth, 100% varietal wine that's full-bodied and expressive in black cherry and dark plum. It finishes in tight, chewy tannins."

Merlot,"Dry and harsh, almost old-fashioned in its tannic astringency, with a green kick of mint. Relieved by a streak of black cherries and cedar. Drink now."
Merlot,"At first this is aggressive, with an aromatic note of wet dog along with blueberries. But soon it finds its legs and opens to display chocolate, espresso and a big batch of black plum and blackberry. The finish has full tannins and some coffee-like flavor. Currently it's wall-to-wall big, but it should settle down in no time and become a good red to drink on any occasion."
Merlot,"Jammy black fruit and berry notes lead the way on this Merlot, with supporting notes of tree bark and black tea. The medium-full mouth offers more juicy dark fruit flavors and dusty tannins that linger through the close. Drink now."
Merlot,"A pretty good everyday Merlot, made from all-coastal grapes, not from the Central Valley. The cherry, blackberry and plum flavors are nice, the tannins are smooth, the wine is totally dry. The one negative is a sharp, minty green streak."
Merlot,"A Merlot with real elegance. This is fully dry, with firm, furry tannins, showing black cherry and currant flavors that are transforming into dried fruits and sweet leather. Could develop for a few more years."
Merlot,"It's all there with this rich Merlot. Fabulously lush in currants, mocha and cedar, it also displays great balance and charm. The tannins are superfine. Drink this beauty now through 2010."
Merlot,"Sort of creamy and unconvincing on the nose, with carob and stemmy berry aromas. The palate runs toward red fruit, but it's also a bit green and herbal. Finishing notes of chocolate and green herbs are typical of Merlot, yet there isn't enough ripe fruit or excitement. Hence, it's a mid-level red wine with some green character. Contains 9% Cabernet and 5% Shiraz."
Merlot,"Aromas of baking spices, clove, vanilla and dark fruit lead to a nuanced palate with fruit and barrel flavors and a light grip of tannins. The alcohol shows through a bit but overall it holds it."
Merlot,"A savory, herbal Merlot with small percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc blended in, Lake County-based Chacewater sources from the Sierra Foothills for this wine, which imparts dry tannins and leather saddle throughout."
Merlot,"Wild berry aromas come with a cool hint of herbal mint. This is full, grabby and solid in the mouth. Flavors of dark fruits come across lightly stewed and pruny, while the finish dishes up a final taste of prune and foresty notes."
Merlot,"Layers of char, black pepper and briar patch help to build complexity in this dense, concentrated black plum Merlot. There's a touch of green leaf and tomato throughout, but overall, it's a fruit-driven, luscious wine accented with spice and smooth, supple tannins. Aged 24 months in new French oak."
Merlot,"This Merlot is thin in body and flavor, with sour cherry and white pepper notes. Despite that, it's clean and dry."
Merlot,"Rock solid, this substantial Merlot is grounded in earth flavors, laced with butter cookie, and finished with tart tannins. The fruit is tight and tangy."
Merlot,"This 100% varietal wine offers aromas of coffee, green herbs, pencil lead and vanilla followed by silky cherry and dark chocolate flavors. There's plenty of appeal but the variety seems to get lost."
Merlot,"This wine offers aromatic notes of blueberry and barrel spices. It's smooth and easy-drinking, not offering much complexity but bringing plenty of appeal."
Merlot,"A simple Merlot, it's easy to drink, and will be very nice with everyday fare like burgers or tacos. It's dry and tannic, yet rich in cherries and red currants, with a smooth coating of toasty oak."
Merlot,"A little green and entirely basic, but in this price range it's not disappointing. The nose offers oregano, tomato and plum all in a savory wrapping, while the palate is lively and plummy, with no huge faults. Juicy as far as feel goes, with a bouncy red fruit-meets-herbal personality."
Merlot,"A great selection for those seeking an affordable organically grown Merlot. Ripe red berries along with notes of mocha and spearmint unfold on the nose, while red plum and cherry take center stage in the mouth. With solid structure and good balance, this is sure to be a crowd pleaser."
Merlot,"Off dry and a bit sugary in style, this easygoing rosé offers intensely ripe, slightly ruddy strawberry and cherry flavors. The finish is brisk and clean."
Merlot,"I found myself returning to this Merlot again and again, because it's such a good, gentle, easy sipper. It's a pleasure to drink one that's so nicely dry and balanced. Does a great job balancing ripe berry and stone fruits with earthy herbs and spices. Sommeliers and restaurateurs, scoop this one up while you can."
Merlot,"Too much of a good thing is how to characterize this Merlot. It's exceptionally ripe with cherries, red currants and mocha. It's also strong in oak. The result is a soft, syrupy confection."
Merlot,"From a Mendocino producer who defends this appellation as Bordeaux country, a rather rough wine, compared to its southerly neighbors from Napa and Sonoma. Blackberry fruit barely ripened, and there are green, stalky flavors in this dry, fairly tannic wine."
Merlot,"There's a sweet cherry and licorice flavor that makes this soft, direct Merlot taste candied. That sweetness lasts all the way through a sugary finish. Drink up."
Merlot,"Strong-like-bull blackberry flavors  follow dirt, oak and a little pepper on the nose—all of the above appear on the finish. It's not terribly lush or complex, but it gets the job done."
Merlot,"Unlike any other Merlots in the region, this fascinating low-alcohol tribute to a northern Italian style shows oregano, thyme, parsley, rainbow peppercorns, dried purple flowers and a seductive hint of green pepper on the elegantly layered nose. The flavors reflects the nuanced nose, with crushed peppers, just-ripe blackberry, iodine and a touch of greenness."
Merlot,"This least expensive of Sterling's latest Merlots stands up respectfully beside the winery's more expensive bottlings, which makes it a good buy. It's very dry, tannic and elegantly structured, with cherry and blackberry flavors enriched with sweet smoky oak."
Merlot,"This is a fruit-forward wine, with aromas of red and black currant and herbs with a spice top note. The flavors are sweet and tangy, going down easy."
Merlot,"Here's a quality Merlot offered at a very reasonable low price. Sant'Adele is rich, succulent and smooth with bursting aromas of cherry, blueberry, spice and moist tobacco. Pair this wine with homemade roast chicken and garlic potatoes."
Merlot,"Soft and semi-sweet in chocolaty fruit, this Merlot has cherry, currant, chocolate and spice flavors that finish dry. It also has an herbal, veggie edge that brings some green mintiness to the equation."
Merlot,"Hard tannins, cutting acidity and a lack of richness conspire to make this bone dry Merlot austere. It has thinned-down flavors of cherries and red currants."
Merlot,"Fully oaked plum and berry aromas are dense and inviting. This feels flush and full, with scratchy tannins. The flavor profile offers plenty of oak and related chocolate to go with blackberry and plum notes. Oak remains in the lead on the finish, which is stacked with blackberry, dark plum and wild-berry flavors. Drink through 2025."
Merlot,"This definitely fits the bill as an affordable weekday red. Red berries, vanilla and spice on the nose and palate offer plenty of enjoyment, while there's just enough softly dusty tannins to provide structure on the crisp finish. Drink now through the end of 2018."
Merlot,"Some wines can hit 15.4% alcohol, as this does, and make it work. But here the burn and scorch from the alcohol simply overwhelms some excellent fruit. Detail is lost, and what's left is a hot, jammy red."
Merlot,"Light and fruity with cherry, plum and red currant flavors along with a subtle hint of menthol on the nose. The mouthfeel is smooth and supple. Mevushal."
Merlot,"In this plush pillow of a wine, smoothness and easy drinkability come along with medium body, soft tannins, not too much crispness and just-ripe-enough flavors."
Merlot,"Firm, hard and tight, this offers black cherry flavors with some peach-pit phenolics. It's sharp and edgy, definitely on the herbal side, with a hint of stem."
Merlot,"Shows off the reasons why Dry Creek has achieved a good reputation for this finicky variety, Merlot. The wine isn't made big, gooey Napa-style. Instead, there's an herbal earthiness to the cherry-berry fruit, and the dry tannins suggest pairing with rich fare."
Merlot,"An easy wine whose ripe fruit and oak flavors are immediately likeable. The cherries, raspberries and plums have a jammy sweetness, yet the tannins are firm. Easy to find, with 27,300 cases produced."
Merlot,"The '04 is considerably better than the '03, probably because the warmer vintage ripened the fruit and did away with the minty greenness. No unripeness here. It's all deliciously jammy blackberry, cherry and chocolate fruit, with an sweet, oaky finish."
Merlot,"A fine blend of ripe cherry, berry, spice and herb flavors, all framed in toasty oak and spice nuance. Smooth but bright on the palate, with a zippy finish and subtle earth tones at the end."
Merlot,"With just over 75% of the fruit coming from Seven Hills and the rest from the winery's young Ferguson vineyard, this wine offers a lot of enjoyment. Aromas suggest herb, cocoa, mineral and an assortment of blue fruit. The flavors are simultaneously luscious yet restrained, backed by firm tannins that should benefit from additional time in the bottle."
Merlot,"Light and dry, this Merlot is a good buy in an everyday wine. It has clean, earthy flavors of berries, cherries, red currants and herbs."
Merlot,"Hand harvested from Block 15 of StoneTree Vineyard with a dollop of Cabernet Sauvignon from Block 14 (10%), it brings notes of coffee, cocoa and plum. The fruit flavors are elegant in style accented by barrel notes and mouthwatering acids. It doesn't seem to have fully reached its potential yet, with the tannins bringing a slightly gritty feel."
Merlot,"Plump blueberry and blackberry fruit meet with crushed slate and root-beer notes on the nose of this widely available bottling. It's a bit thin in body and a tad sweet-leaning, but shows caramelized black fruit and rocky earth on the palate."
Merlot,"For unknown reasons, Chuck Reininger holds back his Merlots; but Reininger makes real Merlot—96% pure—and it works. It's silky and smooth, chocolaty and showing pleasing nuances of herb and grass. The fruit is light, pretty and perfectly ripe, tasting of strawberry, cherry and pomegranate."
Merlot,"Brambly berry and wood notes lend complexity to the luscious cassis and black cherry flavors. It's intensely concentrated with fruit, but bright bursts of acidity and layers of fresh sage and thyme add balance, leading to a long, harmonious finish. Drink now–2020."
Merlot,"This Merlot smells rooty, with licorice and mint to boot. A wide, sort of flabby palate is, at its base, oaky as can be; there's also stewed plum and herbal blackberry flavors in front of a blocky, chunky finish."
Merlot,"This is soft and gentle, with easy berry, herb, cola and sandalwood flavors. Drink now, as this is about as good as it will ever be."
Merlot,"There's a high-toned streak to the red fruit core of this wine, with secondary accents of chocolate-milk mix and vanilla extract to keep things from being too sharp. Drink now."
Merlot,"This Merlot smells rooty, with licorice and mint to boot. A wide, sort of flabby palate is, at its base, oaky as can be; there's also stewed plum and herbal blackberry flavors in front of a blocky, chunky finish."
Merlot,"Licorice, mint leaf, black pepper and a hint of tomato define the nose, while the palate has a regular, lightly choppy feel along with flavors of olive, herbal berry fruit and pepper. Dry and smooth on the finish, with lightness and good balance. Good Merlot for the price."
Merlot,"This wine comes from the original Merlot blocks at this vineyard, planted in 1982. It's aromatic, with notes of plum, raspberry, clove and generous spices. The flavors coat the palate from end to end, backed by firm tannins that need time to soften out but have the strength to go the distance. It will be best after 2022."
Merlot,"Despite 15.1% alcohol, this is dull, one dimensional and rather light. The tannins are a little beefed up, but there's marginal fruit and everything seems a bit out of whack."
Merlot,"Previously from all Seven Hills vineyard grapes, this estate bottling now sources almost half its grapes from the high-altitude, mineral-driven Ferguson vineyard. Peppery spices elevate the nose, leading into a young, tight wine with compact cranberry and strawberry fruit. The depth and minerality are exceptional."
Merlot,"This is a slightly syrupy Merlot that has flavors of overripe plum, black pepper and vanilla, especially on the finish. The blend is mostly Merlot with small amounts of Petite Sirah, Malbec, Cabernet and Zinfandel, all from Clarksburg, a cool subregion near Lodi."
Merlot,"This tiny winery makes just a few hundred cases per year. The Merlot is grapey and rustic, with Grenache-like fruit flavors and some rough, chocolatey oak. —P.G."
Merlot,"Winemaker Kristy Melton continues to show a sense of restraint in her wines. This Merlot provides a classic example, concentrated in dusty red fruit and smooth, supple tannins, a sideways glance of cinnamon and clove flirting thoughout. Structure and elegance reign here over power and oak."
Merlot,"The aromas are so light you need to strain to get at them, with notes of vanilla, coffee and cherry. The palate brings plentiful coffee and cherry flavors that show a pleasing sense of texture. One wants more aromatically, but the palate delivers."
Merlot,"Aromas of boysenberry and barrel spice are followed by ripe pleasing purple-fruit flavors. The tannins deliver a light squeeze. It's hard to find the variety exactly, but it still brings appeal."
Merlot,"Pleasant, with soft texture and tannins and notes of cinnamon and clove, this Lodi Merlot drops a bit at the finish and is 13.1% alcohol."
Merlot,"Savory bramble and crushed-mineral tones lend complexity to ripe flavors of blueberry and plum on the palate of this wine. Medium bodied in style, it's balanced by a streak of cranberry acidity on the midpalate and rigid, fine-grained tannins."
Merlot,"A plummy interpretation of Merlot, this also brings aromas and flavors of herbs and spice. Flavors are sweet and easy drinking with lightly grainy tannins."
Merlot,"Planks of brawny oak are framed around the blueberry and raspberry fruit brimming in this Merlot, a tribute to Jack London's once-home in nearby Glen Ellen. The herbal component lingers ominously, a refreshing taste of mint popping out on the finish."
Merlot,"Robust and fruity, almost rustic in its sandpapery texture, this Merlot, from inland Mendocino County, has berry, cherry and spice flavors, with a deep streak of earth. Bone dry, it's a well-balanced wine that will go well with a nice steak."
Merlot,"A splash of Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon supports this juicy, smoky wine, from vineyards scattered across the wider Napa Valley appellation. Textured, it tastes of brambly, just-picked blackberry, with a robust body through to the finish, which ends lean."
Merlot,"Tastes like a dessert pastry, with baked cherry, cassis, peppermint, milk chocolate and anise flavors that are a little sweet and honeyed. Pleasant, but not impactful. Drink now."
Merlot,"The best Sterling reserve Merlots are ageworthy. The others are merely tannic. This '05 straddles the line. It's certainly a dry, tannicly astringent wine that shuts down the palate. But you'll find some rich black cherry and currant flavors. Roll the dice and give it through 2010 to come around."
Merlot,"Classic Duckhorn, which is to say, dry, tannic, elegantly structured and expensive. The winemaker succeeded, in this so-so year, in crafting a rich, nuanced wine of considerable interest. It may not be a longterm ager, but it's delicious now, with deep flavors of blackberries, red currants, violets, cocoa and smoky oak, balanced with the prettiest acidity. Grows better in the glass as it breathes."
Merlot,"This top cuvée from Carignan has too much wood. That trait, along with its extracted character, makes it hard to like at this stage. With powerful tannins from superripe Merlot, this is going to take many years to reveal any balance. Drink from 2020."
Merlot,"This is stewy smelling, with tomato leaf and raisiny notes. It feels dense and mature, with mild acidity creating jammy raspberry and plum flavors along with a lot of barrel spice. The oak flavor is dominant on the finish."
Merlot,"A little tough and gritty in the mouth, but the flavors are rich, and the wine finishes long and spicy. Underneath the edgy tannins is plenty of black cherry, currant and plum fruit. Drink now."
Merlot,"This well-balanced Merlot displays a deep ruby/purple color and plenty of plum flavors. Coffee and herb notes add a touch of complexity, and the texture is smooth and even. The finish has good length for a modestly priced red."
Merlot,"This is unmistakably a mountain-grown Merlot, hefty with dark fruit and layers of baking spice. Concentrated and ready to age another 5–7 years, it has a long and leathery finish."
Merlot,"Lamaione is Frescobaldi's flagship Merlot and this vintage is especially plush and velvety. The wine's nose recalls inky berry juice, exotic spice and soft tones of leather and tobacco. The finish is long and satisfying, supported by the wine's dense structure."
Merlot,"This is soft and round with pleasing flavors of black cherry and plum. Hints of coffee and chocolate do not tamper with the basic core of clean, ripe fruit. It's quite nicely made, drinking well, and comes into focus in the extended finish."
Merlot,"This 100% varietal wine hails from Stone Tree, Cold Creek and Beverly vineyards. Aromas of vanilla, chocolate, cherry and raspberry lead to exuberant layered fruit flavors. It displays a lot of intensity, focus, and length."
Merlot,"Very rich and classically structured, a wine that shows real Merlot personality. The red cherry, cola, red licorice, sandalwood and peppery spice flavors are almost Pinot Noir-like, except for the tannins, which have the weight of Bordeaux. Should develop through 2012."
Merlot,"Sommeliers will love this wine for its elegance, and the way it's happy to stand back and support food, rather than star at the table. It's dry, medium bodied and tannic, with cherry, red currant, cocoa and sweet oak flavors. Drink over the next 2–3 years."
Merlot,"Dry and a little bitter in tannins, with flavors of cherries, cranberries and herbs. It's elegantly constructed and feels silky and balanced in the mouth. A very nice and versatile food wine that will take a few years of cellaring."
Merlot,"Dry, tannic and severe, this Merlot has modest blackberry and cherry flavors. It's tough to appreciate right out of the bottle, and won't age, so give it an hour or two in a decanter."
Merlot,"Big and brawny, this is dry and hard in tannins, as Nickel & Nickel wines tend to be in youth. This one, from a cool section of southern Napa Valley, is brisk in acids, making it rather closed now. But it has a gigantic core of blackberries, with a delicious edge of dark chocolate. Merlot is a difficult wine to age in California, but this one should improve over the next five years, maybe longer."
Merlot,Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.
Merlot,"Prune and metallic aromas are not fully integrated and fresh but improve with airing. The palate is heavy and tannic, a touch abrasive in feel, with big berry flavors that hammer away due to fierce tannins. Comes on big with berry fruit but always feels rough."
Merlot,Starts out distinctly herbal but as it opens up notes of red currant and pencil lead emerge. The plump fruit flavors are supported by a firm structure of fine grained tannins.
Merlot,"A standout wine, this 100% varietal shows notes of raspberries, plum, bittersweet chocolate and barrel spices. It's classically styled with layer upon layer of fruit flavors, showing richness yet deftness with a real sense of freshness and vibrancy. It has all of the stuffing to lay down in the cellar until 2030 or more. Drinks best at 62 degrees."
Merlot,"Solid, chunky and dense, this shows a rich character based around dark tannins. It has a ripe black-plum flavor and juicy acidity on the finish."
Merlot,"Generic red-fruit aromas set up a solid palate. This tastes of roasted plum and berry fruits, while a straightforward finish is grabby in feel and tastes the slightest bit herbal and green."
Merlot,"Hints of vanilla and spice add warmth to pristine blackberry and plum flavors in this brisk, medium-bodied Merlot. It's tart with cranberry acidity and finishes with a lingering granite minerality."
Merlot,"Handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot figure into this wine, a lovely, medium-bodied beauty that finds balance in its measured use of oak. Vanilla, plum and bold jolts of pepper and cinnamon combine well on the lengthy palate."
Merlot,"For an affordable, everyday red, this is a pretty good investment. It's dry and full-bodied, with berry, earth, mocha and spice flavors."
Merlot,"Rubbery aromas and a pasty note are on equal footing with plum and cherry scents. This is choppy and mildly astringent in feel, with narrow plum and raspberry flavors that finish quick and with pinching tannins."
Merlot,"Simple, forward flavors of vanilla syrup and fresh-cut tobacco seem to define the Milbrandt lineup. A tart berry flavor and chocolaty tannins make for a supple, flavorful Merlot."
Merlot,"This is ripe in cherry and red currant flavors, with a smoky, bacony touch from the charred oak. The mouthfeel is marked by edgy tannins. Drink now."
Merlot,"In a sea of mediocre Merlots, Longboard's '06 stands out. It's not only deliciously ripe and generous in blackberries, cherries, currants, licorice, cola and mocha flavors, but the structure of fine acidity and smooth, elegant tannins makes it delectable."
Merlot,"This is a very delicious and accessible wine for all palates, both lavish in style and complex. Candied blackberry, fragrant rose and fennel pollen aromas introduce a palate of baked red fruit, maple syrup and brown sugar flavors. That fruit-forward richness is balanced by extreme floral character and lively acidity."
Merlot,"This Merlot seems designed for folks who like their red wines with residual sugar. It's soft and sugary, with raspberry jam and oak flavors."
Merlot,"Here is a lovely expression of Merlot from the up-and-coming Montescudaio zone, which is located on the Tuscan coast just north of Bolgheri. The wine shows immense softness, and it has a huge cherry flavor that has been shaped by spice and chocolate accents from 18 months in barrel."
Merlot,"Pretty generic-tasting but basically good, a dry red wine with considerable tannins and acids that frame herbal cherry flavors."
Merlot,"This wine tastes sweet and grapey, with a softness that becomes cloying and a preponderance of baked flavor."
Merlot,"A wine that elicits mixed feelings. On the plus side, subtle fruit and oak, with a rich earthiness and sleek tannins. Does a good job of keeping Merlot fat and plump, while maintaining an herbal character. On the other hand, there's pronounced acidity and a sharpness that shows up on the finish. Doesn't seem likely to age well, but you never know. —S.H."
Merlot,"This squat bottle comes, indeed, straight from the barrel with no filtering, and works quite well. Bright and plump purple fruits mix with vanilla and a tickling acidity on the nose. The palate shows juicy cherry fruit as well as blackberry and blueberry, with richness from vanilla and caramel. The tannins are a bit tough, but rugged in the right ways."
Merlot,"This soft and approachable Merlot brims in smoke and oak, with subtle plum fruit. A slight layering of spice on the back of the palate is pleasing."
Merlot,"This is a nice, easy-drinking Merlot, but it also has enough complexity to pair with a good cut of meat. It's dry and shows stylishly fine tannins that frame rich flavors of blackberries, cherries, licorice and cola."
Merlot,"Mossy, furry, leafy black fruit aromas are a reasonably good opening. Feels upright and alert, with bright acidity. Flavors of plum and berry blend with chocolate, herbs and spice in front of a grabby, slightly clacky finish."
Merlot,"A terrific Merlot, especially at this price. Impresses for its soft lushness and intricate flavors of berries, currants, cola, anise, pepper and sandalwood. A real bargain. Production was 2,500 cases. Drink soon."
Merlot,"This Merlot isn't very complicated, but it does have the soft juiciness you want in the variety. The flavors of cola and red cherries finish dry and spicy."
Merlot,"Already five years old, this wine still doesn't hasn't opened up, seeming fairly muted aromatically. The flavors are medium bodied, round in the middle and tapering toward the finish."
Merlot,"Aromas of raisin, tobacco, cedar and toasted oak lead the nose on this full-bodied Merlot. The palate offers dried black cherry, black currant, graphite, licorice and clove alongside firm tannins that are rather rough on the finish."
Merlot,"Those notorious mountain tannins have largely melted, making the wine drinkable now, although it will hold for a decade with proper cellaring. Lush and velvety, with a drop of Cabernet Franc, this is voluptuous in cherries, black currants and fine, toasty oak."
Merlot,"Good and dry, with rugged, dusty tannins and fine varietal flavors. Shows real elegance and class, with cherry, red currant, cedar and spice flavors. Drink now–2013."
Merlot,"All five Bordeaux grapes are included in this Merlot, a substantial and well crafted wine with bright berry and cassis flavors front and center. Good complexity for the price, with olive, dust, mocha and caramel in the mix. Tannins are balanced and slightly grainy, with good length through the finish."
Merlot,"A brilliant, rich wine, packed with full-bodied flavors but oozing with finesse and elegance. The tastes veer to plums, blackberries and chocolate, and the finish is dry and complex. The tannins are thick but soft. This delicious wine was made by Jim Fetzer with organically-grown grapes."
Merlot,"Merlot remains a solid strength at Dumas Station, thanks to the Minnick Hills and Birch Creek Vineyard fruit. Half the barrels were new, an equal percentage of French and American oak, lending a strong bourbon aroma, along with tobacco and vanilla components. The fruit remains a bit constrained, with black fruits leading into a core of cassis. Give this one a good decanting."
Merlot,"Big and brooding with richly concentrated black plums and velvety, mouthfilling tannins, Roman Roth's namesake Merlot is boldly structured, but beautifully nuanced as well, with sprays of violet perfume and just a whiff of wet, earthy forest and dried herb notes. Drink now with a good decant, or hold for another 2–3 years."
Merlot,"Since its inception, Wölffer winemaker Roman Roth's namesake Merlot has been one of the best wines in Long Island. The 2012 bottling is no exception. It's a bold, densely fruity wine full of luscious black cherry, plum and currant flavors. Powerful yet finessed, it's keenly anchored by a core of cranberry acidity and complexities of bramble, violet and spice. Delicious already but sure to improve through at least 2030."
Merlot,"This wine commands attention with its aromas of dark raspberries, milk chocolate and barrel spices. Flavors show plenty of richness and intensity with a supple texture that dazzles."
Merlot,"A delicious Merlot, drily tannic and rich in blackberries, cherries and chocolate. Nearly as good as the winery's much more expensive Reserve. Great with grilled steak with sautéed mushrooms."
Merlot,"Aggressive on the palate, this has harp acids that frame flavors of sour cherry candy and green mint."
Merlot,"Aromas of black cherry and green frying peppers prepare the palate for flavors of cherry, blackberry, green bell pepper and licorice. Smooth tannins and strong fruit flavors are slightly overcome by green notes, and the cool bell pepper finish yields soft touches of cherry."
Merlot,"Galatrona is one of Italy's top Merlots and 2004 is its best vintage yet. The mouthfeel is extraordinary, distinguished by spectacular smoothness and elegance: The wine drinks like a chiaroscuro painting where all elements are harmonious by design. And there's excellent dimension with vibrant tones of red fruit and sweet spice woven within its fruity fabric."
Merlot,"L'Apparita is a divine and delicate expression of Merlot with rich layers of black cherry, blackberry, spice, mocha, cedar, exotic spice and polished stone that are seamlessly woven together. The wine hits the palate with the softness and richness of the world's best Merlots and leaves a fading impression of fruit and spice that can be counted in many long, delicious minutes. Hold until 2018."
Merlot,"A little too soft for aging, but ultra-refined, with complex cherry, red currant, balsam, cola and mushroom flavors. It's very dry and ready to drink now, despite some hard tannins."
Merlot,"A note of sweet, dark earth picks up tones of worn saddle leather and wood-inflected cherry. Medium in body, this possesses a succulent core and chewy tannins."
Merlot,"This is a great house pour for fans of Chilean Merlot with its consistent fruit, soft acidity and low tannins. On the nose and palate, a core of sweet, Red Delicious apple is accented by dry leather, toasty vanilla and dried herbs. Simple, but well crafted."
Merlot,"Vineyard designated Merlot is a rarity in the state, though this is one of the three the winery made in this vintage. Amped volatile aromas and generous barrel spices are followed by light, slightly dried-out cranberry and cherry flavors."
Merlot,"Toasty, roasted aromas of earthy plum and berry fruits set up a full-bodied but friendly palate of soft tannins. Dark, oaky, minty flavors of black fruits finish with peppery spice, good length and some heat."
Merlot,"Simple but meaty, this 100% Merlot has substantial weight in the midpalate. There are plenty of powerful herbal flavors, yet the grapes seem ripe enough, offering prune and cassis and a little pepper from aging in American oak."
Merlot,"A large-production wine that's simple and straightforward in its dark cherry flavor and soft texture, this wine is a crowd-pleaser. It finishes quick but satisfying."
Merlot,"Made entirely with Merlot, this has a shy nose that tries to hide suggestions of plum and bell pepper. The straightforward palate provides plum with hints of vanilla and clove alongside grainy tannins."
Merlot,"Layers of coffee, vanilla and spice lend an oaky undertone to this plump, easygoing red. The palate is approachably fruity, offering a generous dose of fleshy plum and cherry flavors. Feathery fine tannins and a kiss of vanilla mark the finish."
Merlot,"This vineyard-designated Merlot includes 14% Cabernet Sauvignon. This vintage, Syrah is eliminated and alcohol is lowered—a welcome shift. Rich and loaded with black fruits, it carries interesting accents of caramel popcorn, yielding a delicious, tongue-coating wine with a silky-smooth mouthfeel. It has good length, and the possibility of aging for another five or six years."
Merlot,"Generous, fruity and rich, this ripe wine has black chocolate flavors to go with its soft tannins and rounded structure. At the end, acidity gives freshness and blackberry-jelly sweetness."
Merlot,"This is a big Merlot, earthy but a tad flat, with a tobacco-like bitterness on the tail end."
Merlot,"Feels plush and important as soon as you taste it, not only for the ripe cherry, red currant, cola and spice flavors, but for the structure, which is dry and elegant. However, it's a very young wine, not ready to drink, although that won't stop many people from popping the cork now. Give it through the summer of 2009."
Merlot,"Ripe yet deftly balanced, this full-bodied wine offers an abundance of blackberry fruitiness balanced by tones of granite and dried herb. It's sumptuous and expansive on the palate, finishing long with fine, sharply edged tannins."
Merlot,"The nose on this bottling is a tad fruit-punchy at first, with light red cherry and candied pomegranate aromas, but then picks up complexity with a leather note. The palate also offers that leather alongside tobacco and light elderberry fruit."
Merlot,"Here's an everyday Merlot for easy drinking with beef, pork and chicken dishes. It's soft, dry and tannic, with modest cherry and herb flavors."
Merlot,"The vineyard-designated wines from Novelty Hill consistently reflect the site in terms of a deep-seated earthy, herbal character. It's quite like a modern Bordeaux, taking the cassis fruit as a base and cloaking it with toasted flavors from earth and barrel."
Merlot,"Bordeaux wine should not have high alcohol; it detracts from the play between fruit and tannins, as in this wine. It is powered by its extracted structure, with flavors of bitter chocolate that leave the fruit behind."
Merlot,"A good choice for fans of older wines, the Raphael 2002 Merlot shows mature forest floor and earth scents but is still hanging on to some raspberry and blackberry fruit. The crisp palate has a mouthwatering character and a touch of singed plum flavor. Woody tannins chime in on the medium finish. Drink before 2011."
Merlot,"This small-batch Merlot (57 cases total) is concentrated up front, with aromas of balsam wood, cigar box, asphalt and hard-charging black fruits. The palate is hard as rocks, with intense but narrow dark-berry flavors in front of a pinched finish loaded with blackberry, pepper and chocolate flavors as well as fierce leftover tannins. Drink through 2020."
Merlot,Aromas like cedar and marascino cherries are followed by good red and black cherry flavors. A firm and tannic texture gives this medium-bodied wine a rustic touch.
Merlot,"Garnet colored in the glass, this wine has a bouquet of cherry that is heightened by a striking note of bell pepper. It offers flavors of cranberry and pomegranate that meld into a zesty but persistent finish."
Merlot,"Fruit and barrel aromas intermingle, with notes of vanilla, coconut, wood spice, clove and red berries. The red fruit flavors are fresh and focused, with lightly grainy tannins providing the frame."
Merlot,"This is the winery's first single-vineyard Merlot. Polished and dense, its aromatics are a multidimensional mix of cassis, espresso, cacao and tobacco. Firm and full, the flavors continue along the same lines, going deep into a thoroughly satisfying finish."
Merlot,"Good structure on this dry table wine, with firm tannins and cleansing acidity. But there's not a whole lot of flavor, with watered-down notes of blackberries."
Merlot,"Heady notes of cedar and pine lend a woodsy undertone to plump blueberry and black cherry flavors in this slightly soft, yielding Merlot. Delicate acidity and whisper-light tannins add to its plush feel. Drink now through 2018."
Merlot,"A Sierra Foothills-area Merlot without much aroma or deep flavor, fairly middle of the road and 14.9% alcohol."
Merlot,"A lovely Merlot, soft and supple. Shows a fine balance of cherry fruit, herbs and sweet oak, with modest alcohol and dusty tannins. Very nice and elegant."
Merlot,"A real delight for its delicious drinkability, and a revelation for Monterey Merlot. Shows the acidity and varietal purity of the Arroyo Seco region, with intense plum and blackberry flavors balanced by a rich earthiness."
Merlot,"Vanilla, herb, cherry, coconut and barrel spice aromas are followed by supple cherry and spice flavors in this wine. The barrel influence is a bit up-front, but it still provides plenty of pleasure."
Merlot,"This is a fat, soft and smooth wine. It has juicy red fruit and acidity, with light tannins that lend support. It's ready to drink."
Merlot,"High-toned and already considerably far down the aging path, this 98% pure Merlot (2% Cabernet Sauvignon) brings the heat (14.9% alcohol) and packs substantial, earthy tannins. The fruit flavors remain on the lighter side of strawberry and raspberry, with a strong herbal component running through the middle and into the finish."
Merlot,"Sweet and direct, this has blackberry, cherry jam, mocha and spicy sandalwood flavors. There's plenty of charm, but not much complexity. Drink now."
Merlot,"Espresso, dark chocolate, herb and purple fruit aromas lead to a soft, smooth palate in this wine. Fruit and barrel notes play equal parts, yet it comes up short on the finish."
Merlot,"Leathery in tobacco and black currant, this wine leaves a bold imprint of toasty tannins."
Merlot,"Soft berry and pepper spice aromas give this elegant red a mellow start. On the palate, savory meat and cherry flavors are touched with an herbal lift. Smooth and delicate in nature, and a pretty sipping wine."
Merlot,"Fresh black cherry and plum aromas are pristine and primary, accentuating flavors of spiced cherry pie in this approachable wine. Juicy and ripe on the palate, it's also elegant with soft, finely-grained tannins that linger on the finish."
Merlot,"Cherry pie, cherry candy and dried ginger notes converge for a very approachable and inviting nose on this bottling from a sprawling vineyard in eastern Paso Robles. It's light in body, but solid red cherry, cedar and smoked chocolate flavors keep it lively."
Merlot,"Great vineyards, great winery, great vintage: There's lots to like about this big, bold, fruity wine that manages to be complex and elegant at the same time. Masses of blackberry, black currant and violets, with smoke and vanilla from oak aging. What's hard to convey is the balance, richness, harmony and depth of flavor, which are really stunning. Age it for a few years if you want, but it's at or near its delicious best now."
Merlot,"Hard and tannic at first, this young wine grudgingly reveals a core of very tart cherry fruit, encased in flavors of stem and wood. A coffee-infused finish does not conceal the chewy, tough tannins."
Merlot,"A moderately aromatic Merlot with notes of raspberry, ash, and herbs. Completely coats the palate with an unusually chalky, thick feel."
Merlot,"Some good things are going on with this wine, including abundant red fruit and a soft feel. However the wood overpowers them with strong aromas and flavors of vanilla, dill and coconut along with a bitter note that distracts."
Merlot,"Dry, spicy berry aromas are pedestrian but fine. This is tight, fresh and a touch scraping on the palate, with plum, currant and roasted flavors. Spicy, minty and solid on the finish, this is a perfectly good Merlot with limitations."
Merlot,"Combining estate grapes with others from cooler Carneros, this wine offers a dried herb component and plenty of pencil and cedar. Tannic and oaky before airing, it'll benefit from a decant."
Merlot,"It's obvious from the alcohol that the Merlot here was very ripe. But, happily, it doesn't taste that way. The balance of rich raisin and red plum flavors are well balanced by acidity. There is some smokiness from wood, the ripeness finishing freshly with a black cherry taste."
Merlot,"Despite the Columbia Valley label this is all Red Mountain, old-vine Merlot from the winery's estate vineyard. Raspberry, mocha, clove and spice aromas lead to supple, understated fruit flavors and an extended finish. It's a perfect example of what makes this variety special in Washington."
Merlot,"Deep black cherry in the glass, this wine has a fruit-forward nose of raspberry and watermelon. Flavors of tart cherry and cranberry are quickly overcome by tannins that are a little too stiff for their own good."
Merlot,"A very nice Merlot whose smooth texture and sophisticated flavors make it a bargain at this price. Ready to drink now, it has flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha and mint, enriched with a subtle coating of smoky oak."
Merlot,"Nice and dry, with a good bite of firm tannins, but it's a little flat in the flavor profile. Shows decent cherry, berry, herb and cedar flavors that could be more vibrant and complex. But it is elegantly structured."
Merlot,"Made entirely with Merlot, this opens with delicate aromas of black-skinned fruit and a whiff of baking spice. The mature palate reveals prune and vanilla alongside rather evolved tannins. Enjoy soon."
Merlot,"Juicy and smoky, this robust wine is thickly textured and earthy in dusty dried herb. Blackberry, tar and leather provide ample additional intrigue, with a pleasing taste of strawberry jam and supportive, toasty oak."
Merlot,"A smooth, almost satiny Merlot, with generous flavors of plum and cassis. The ample fruit is wrapped in darker flavors, providing a coating streaked with licorice, dusted with coffee grounds and finished with chocolate."
Merlot,"Blueberries and black cherries meet with rose petals, dark chocolate, brown spice and black tea on the nose of this bottling from a historic vineyard. The mouthfeel is soft with creamy tannins that grow grippier across the sip, showing cedar, black-cherry mousse, baking spice and a tinge of acidity."
Merlot,"From the producer's organically farmed estate, this light elegant red is Old World in approach and execution, offering delicate aromas of leather pouch and black pepper. Wraparound tannins provide structure within a graceful framework of plum and cedar, as the oak integrates to preserve a freshness of acidity and lively complexity."
Merlot,"It should be easy to drink this sweetish Merlot with everything from a hamburger to a steak. It's rich in cherry flavor, with lots of palate-stimulating spices."
Merlot,"More like Zin than Merlot, a peppery, full-bodied wine with some ripe to overripe blackberry, cassis and raisin flavors. But even if it's not particularly varietal, it's a pretty good wine, with a long, rich finish."
Merlot,"It's no disrespect to say this is a great family restaurant-style Merlot. Tens of millions of Americans dig into beef at the neighborhood joint, and they want a good red to drink alongside it. At this price, this is that wine. It's soft and rich with blackberries, blueberries and chocolate, with a finish of sweet, toasty oak."
Merlot,"This wine is 100% varietal and comes from a single block and clone (clone 3). Aromas of woodspice, blue fruit and herbs lead to sweet, supple fruit flavors and grainy tannins. There are a lot of good things going on but the wood steps a bit in front of them."
Merlot,"Fairly tannic, this Merlot has some ripe, even sweet, cherry fruit. It's done in a light style, but it feels and tastes ripe, which means the winemaker knew what he was doing. A lovely effort that takes full advantage of the character of the region's fruit. —P.G."
Merlot,"With just a handful of Malbec, this wine takes time to open before becoming juicy, herbal and elegant, expressive in tobacco and black tea. The tannins fine and dry."
Merlot,"Made in a light, pleasant style, and the drily tannic balance makes it food-friendly. Shows cherry, red currant, cola and oak flavors, with an earthy edge of herbs."
Merlot,"Bramble, violet and leather notes lend complexity to this fruity but elegantly composed Merlot. Ripe plum and cherry flavors are plump but pristine, brightened by crisp acidity and a smooth velvety finish of tannins. Drinks well already but should improve through 2021."
Merlot,"A thick, dark Merlot, cloaked in smooth, fat tannins and redolent of cherry, licorice, blackberry, plum, spice, coffee, sage, thyme and hints of orange peel. Long and sleek, with toasty oak on the finish. Just a hint of tartness at the end, but still a terrific wine."
Merlot,"This is a fine wine, reflective of the vintage's generosity and approachable nature, giving off flavors of vanilla, cherry and currant alongside a sanguine, gamey character and smoky full-bodied ripeness."
Merlot,"Tastes a bit sweet and jammy in sour cherry candy flavors, with high acidity giving it some sting. Doesn't seem likely to improve, so drink now."
Merlot,"Tastes hot and strong, a heavy wine with earthy, tobacco flavors softened with a hint of briary berry. Totally dry, with an astringent finish."
Merlot,"A great value wine to pair with homemade spaghetti sauce or grilled sausage with onions and bell peppers, this wine is soft and lush, with cherry, almond and blackberry notes. There's a touch of sweet strawberry on the close."
Merlot,"This soft wine is full of red fruit. It has a fine balance of acidity and gentle tannins. From the fruity 2012 vintage, it's now ready to drink."
Merlot,"Clear, bright and fragrant, with a soft and seductive nose. This is a wine that can only be called pretty, with a light floral component to it—roses maybe. There’s lots of ripe black-cherry fruit, some raspberries, and a chocolaty edge. It’s made for drinking right away, but structured enough for near-term aging."
Merlot,"This concentrated Merlot is blended with smaller percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Syrah. Dense in black licorice and toasty oak, the fruit character is dominated by red plum and berry aromas and flavors."
Merlot,"This wine opens with aromas of vanilla and baking spices that are followed by broad, silky-feeling fruit and barrel flavors, finishing on a somewhat bitter note. The oak holds a prominent role but still plays its part well."
Merlot,"Tightly wound, with big, edgy tannins that accentuate the acidity. Underneath you'll find dry, elegant flavors of tart cherries, red currants and violets. A polished, pretty wine that could pick up some nuances over the next 2–3 years."
Merlot,"Very tart, with a deep, tannic, earthy mineral streak. There's an iron/earth streak running through all Abacela wines; here it comes across as iron and slightly bitter licorice. This is still very young and green; the score might well improve with more time in the bottle."
Merlot,"Here's a supple, velvet-textured Merlot from the all-around successful 2012 vintage in California. It pulls together baking-spice aromas and attractive, ripe flavors of raspberry and cherry on the medium-bodied palate. It conveys a sense of breadth and meatiness without being heavy."
Merlot,"A lovely Merlot, this is pure, vibrant and elegant. It has classic cherry, red-currant and cedar flavors, and while there's a sweetness at the core, the finish is thoroughly dry. Wonderful to drink now with steak or lamb."
Merlot,"This is a dense and heavily extracted Merlot that is too powerful for its own good. Concentrated and super-rich, the palate is laden with tannins and toasty wood. The wine will remain over the top."
Merlot,"Huge, gigantic, so impressive for its sheer volume of fruit. At the age of nearly five years, it's as fresh as the day it was released, with rich flavors of cherries, red currants and dark chocolate. Shows Merlot's soft tannins, making it lovely to drink now, but should continue to develop over the next 6–8 years."
Merlot,"Here's a “wow” wine you won't easily forget. Messorio is all Merlot, and happily delivers the softness, richness and overall opulence that we love in this noble grape variety. What elevates this particular expression and vintage is the true elegance and sophistication evident here. This is a huge wine, but it's not exaggerated and the finish is as long and smooth as they come."
Merlot,"This new lineup from Columbia Crest features fruit exclusively from the Horse Heaven Hills AVA, which provides a welcome focus to the wines. Fruit-powered, but more substantial than either the Grand Estates or the Two Vines, this shows persistent flavors of tangy raspberry and blackberry, moderate acids and plenty of cocoa in the finish."
Merlot,"Juicy and plummy, this is a wine with generous amounts of purple fruit scents and flavors up front. The tannins turn a bit green and show some bitterness in the finish."
Merlot,"This is a forceful, simple wine, with a slight herbaceous quality that keeps it varietal and cooler-climate in style and weight. Bright red fruit shines in a light-bodied frame."
Merlot,"Opening with a bouquet of red berries complemented by an earthy element, this Merlot offers more fruit on the palate, together with a spicy note. A medium-weight wine with decent acidity, it finishes dry, with more berry and earth notes."
Merlot,"Pure and fruity, this medium-bodied wine is supersmooth in texture, quietly flavorful and well balanced. The light acidity and mild tannins are well integrated and support delicious black-cherry and blueberry flavors perfectly."
Merlot,"A rich, stately nose announces the elegance of this Merlot from the consistently poised Vergelegen. Balanced flavors of berry and spice and smooth, subtle tannins give the wine additional class. Drinkable now, but the wine could easily age."
Merlot,"Soft and simple, with chocolaty flavors of blackberry and cherry jam. With low acidity, the tannins provide the only opportunity for balance."
Merlot,"Incredibly rich and delicious aromas of vanilla, scotch, blackberry jam, strawberry preserves and cola get a dash of added intrigue from the green hint of pasilla chile. The palate shows dark chocolate and blueberry-boysenberry juice, proving very rich but not overly dense in mouthfeel."
Merlot,"This is a very firm, tight and focused effort, with a clean cherry flavor. It is not at all like most Washington Merlots, which are often heavily influenced by new oak aging. Here is a concise, pure expression that may come across as a little monochromatic, perhaps because it seems to be somewhat shut down at the moment. Made using grapes from 10-year-old vines, it shows great promise."
Merlot,"Aromas of balsam wood, sandalwood-scented soap, blackberry and rubber feed into a drawing palate with abrasive tannins. A heavy oak character leads blackberry and licorice flavors, while this feels tannic and grabby on the finish, with acidity that sticks out. Drink through 2023."
Merlot,"Dry and soft, this is a pretty Merlot to drink with lusty fare, like barbecued pork and tri-tip. It has tannin-inspired flavors of black cherries, red currants, mocha, bacon and spice. Drink now."
Merlot,"This wine plays with the herbal, slightly green side of the Bordeaux grape, with oregano, thyme and just-cracked pepper spicing up the soft red strawberry and plum fruit on the nose. Dried herbs show strongly on the palate, alongside elderberry fruit and cedar."
Merlot,"This wine gets the all-star treatment, blending fruit from 14 vineyards, and aging it in 60% new French oak. It's a substantial, muscular effort, with dark fruit, earth and tar components. A small addition of Petit Verdot darkens the color and thickens the tannins. There is just a hint of alcoholic burn in the finish."
Merlot,"The intriguing nose presents juicy grape candy, but in a serious way, with black licorice and maduro cigar notes. It's lighter than expected once sipped, but strong flavors of smoked meats and boysenberry fruit touch all parts of the palate."
Merlot,"Smoky barbecue and big oak and tannin combine for power and density in this wine, which has a handful of Malbec blended in. Hard to penetrate at first, it over time reveals notes of blackberry, savory leather and cedar."
Merlot,"Spicy, oaky aromas grab attention, followed by black plum and cherry flavors and a firm structure of tannins and acidity. This is full bodied and rather powerful in both flavor and mouthfeel."
Merlot,"Complexity and varietal character come through in this concentrated, well-balanced and smoothly polished wine. It is full bodied and lightly tannic, but so oozing with flavors that it's still easy to sip. The array of black plum, light sage, and black olive flavors is accented with very light oak."
Merlot,"This is a smooth, ripe and generous wine befitting southern Merlot. It has just the right amount of acidity, black currant fruitiness and a smoky aftertaste."
Merlot,"Nicely behaved and well balanced, this gentle wine offers medium body, fresh plum flavors and a texture that's smooth and lightly tannic. The color is relatively deep and aromas are fruity, with a touch of earth."
Merlot,"Smooth and instantly appealing, this estate-grown Merlot has a broad, chocolaty palate that's loaded with cherry fruit. There are peppery, herbal highlights, and plenty of lingering, polished tannins."
Merlot,"Don't look for density or any particular varietal focus here, but what you will find is a pleasing, soft, smooth wine with black cherry, licorice, smoke and chocolate. It's all front-loaded and fruit-driven, but if you want something to enjoy right now, preferably outdoors, with some butterfat in the soft, pliable tannins, this wine will deliver the goods."
Merlot,"This is an aromatically appealing wine with notes of cocoa, coffee, cherry and woodspice. It's full bodied with a lot of richness to the tart cherry flavors that need some time to settle in."
Merlot,Not an abundance of fruit here but the nose does show some nice minerality while a few gooseberry hints emerge in the mouth. The palate is on the watery side but is redeemed by some nice pear character that lingers on the finish. Drink up.
Merlot,"Soft, ripe, red fruit-flavored Merlot gives a round character to this rich wine. It has plenty of spice, juicy acidity and gentle tannins that make it drinkable young."
Merlot,Decadent aromas of warmed chocolate and hazelnut coffee lead onto the pliant palate. Chalky tannins keep the vanilla-tinged finish grounded.
Merlot,"This 100% Merlot is sourced from Sagemoor Farms' Bacchus and Dionysus vineyards. For the first time, there is no Cabernet Franc in the blend. Richly fruity, with loads of cherry, raspberry compote and black currant flavors, this melds in grace notes of chocolate and caramel, seamlessly. Thick and flat-out luscious, yet structured with a tannic spine that gives definition and focus all the way through."
Merlot,"One of Italy's most acclaimed Merlots, this concentrated wine opens with scents of black currants, cedar, sage and espresso. The firmly structured but polished palate delivers dried black cherry, black pepper, coffee and licorice alongside a backbone of velvety tannins. Drink 2017–2022."
Merlot,"The Il Tralcetto line of wines is packaged with a real grape vine clipping looped over the neck of the bottle. Inside is a fresh and easy expression of Merlot that is redolent of cherry, raspberry and spice."
Merlot,"Woody aromas of tree bark, forest floor and earthy, minty berry fruits lead to a full and stocky feeling palate with wiry, herbal, oak-heavy flavors of plum and mint. On the finish, this is tannic, with strong spice notes and a hint of green."
Merlot,"This Riserva expression of Merlot from cool-climate Alto Adige delivers fantastic intensity and purity. The aromas of cherry, spice, leather and red rose are chiseled and crisp. The wine is soft and velvety in the mouth with a long parade of berry fruit flavors on the long finish. Serve this wine with sophisticated meat dishes or cellar age five to ten more years."
Merlot,"This wine has all the necessary smoothness, plus deep plum and cherry flavors and touches of spicy oak, too. The texture feels layered and the fruit components are vivid and tasty. It all comes together gracefully on the palate and the finish."
Merlot,"A rich, ripe expression of one of Italy's iconic wines, this displays the heat of the 2011 vintage. It opens with aromas of red currants, tobacco, oak and exotic spice while the full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherries, blueberry extract, licorice and black pepper. Densely concentrated and tightly packed with assertive but fine-grained tannins, you'll need to give this time to unwind. Drink 2017–2026."
Merlot,"Deficient in acidity and tannins, this soft wine lacks needed structure. It feels melted and collapsed in the mouth, and a little hot. But it's very tasty in raspberries, cherries, milk chocolate and spices."
Merlot,"This 100% Merlot offers a lot of heat around its otherwise approachable lift of soft, smooth tannins and reasonable oak. Sage, cedar and tobacco provide a weedy aspect to the wine, offset by plenty of ripe blackberry and cherry."
Merlot,"Candied berry aromas are jumpy, herbal and foxy. This has a raw pinched mouthfeel and minty herbal plum and berry flavors. On the finish, green elements rise to the level of herbaceous."
Merlot,"There's no Merlot in California that's richer or more decadent than this. The flavors of cherry pie filling, cassis, red currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky oak are totally delicious. Granted, the wine is a little soft, with a melted texture, and classicists will complain it's made in the International style. They're missing out on a real hedonistic pleasure."
Merlot,"A bit coarse in the mouth, with a sandpapery tartness through the finish. On the plus side, the wine is fully dry and well-flavored, with black cherries, currants, spicy teriyaki beef and cedar. Drink now."
Merlot,"Given the vineyard location, on the eastern edge of the Columbia Gorge, this is a unique take on Merlot, falling somewhere between the broad, fleshy Washington style, and the thinner, more herbal southern Oregon style. The layered flavors mix berry, citrus and red plum, in an open, easy-drinking wine that should pair well with a variety of transitional autumn entrées."
Merlot,"Though it's 100% Merlot from Red Mountain, this seems more generic than representative of what that AVA can produce. It could be any modestly priced Bordeaux red variety or blend—red fruits, stiff tannins, and a seamless, yet one-dimensional mouthfeel."
Merlot,"It's a treat to find a well-priced Merlot that has some gutsy tannin and dark fruit to go along with its sweeter flavors and mild texture. This wine has concentrated black cherry, clove and oak spice flavors, with a firm structure and lingering finish."
Merlot,"Wild red berries, crushed pepper, lilacs and a frame of asphalt show on the exuberant nose of this bottling. The palate is loaded with meat, smoke, cedar, charcoal and easy boysenberry flavors, the perfect pairing for a hamburger. It is a tad light in body, especially since it hasaged for so many years."
Merlot,"A light sheath of sulfur sits atop the aromas of woodshop, brown spice, dried strawberry and chopped nuts. This supple Merlot sports low to medium amounts of dusty tannins, which frame the flavors of mocha and cherry. The longer the wine sits in the glass, the more the flavors seem to fade."
Merlot,"This wine's cola, forest floor, cherry and cassis aromas are promising, but on the palate it's a tannic crusher, with mouth-blasting acids. It feels abrasive and tastes of rubbery black fruits."
Merlot,"Pepper Bridge fruit makes up the majority of this wine, with the balance coming from Sheridan and Olsen vineyards. It offers aromas of barrel spice, herb, anise and exotic spice that lead to pitch-black, ever-so-slightly dried-out fruit flavors."
Merlot,"Fresh and fruity, it has aromas of red currant, cranberry, plum and orange peel. These are followed by medium-bodied fruit flavors with cranberry-like acidity."
Merlot,"Consulting winemaker Michel Rolland oversees this bottling in the Long Shadows series. Fans of his forward, sometimes voluptuous style may find this vintage a bit thin. The fruit is peppery and the tannins chewy, while the barrel flavors of chocolaty oak have not quite assimilated. Further bottle age might improve the wine."
Merlot,"Iron and steel, rock and earth are the first things you notice about this mineral-inflected, single-vineyard Merlot. It's an ode to tannin and terroir, a tough, tight and dense wine with primary fruit flavors of cranberry and cassis."
Merlot,"Sharp Concord grape ripeness meets with a touch of chile pepper and dark tobacco on the nose of this bottling. The palate is redolent with aromatic woods, from cedar to sandalwood, as well as blueberries and dried herbs, but it's a tad thin."
Merlot,"This 100% Merlot was—intriguingly—aged for three months on Chardonnay lees. It has notes of herbs, cherries and green vegetables. It has an appealing, broad texture, finishing on a bitter note."
Merlot,"This is a beautiful wine from the nose on out. Complex and aromatic, it has Italian-style tobacco scents, fresh acidity, leafy highlights, and undertones of tar, licorice and clove, all wrapped around tart, pie cherry fruit."
Merlot,"This wine offers aromas of ripe plum, raisin and mocha, with hints of toasted oak. The palate opens with ripe blackberry and plum notes, but finishes abruptly, closing on an astringent note."
Merlot,"From the Apalta Vineyard in Colchagua, this robust, fruity Merlot is rich and sweet, and offers a fine mesh of blueberry and black raspberry fruit. The wine is warm and friendly, and overall it's quite easy to drink. The structure is there and so is the flavor and foundation. And it improves with airing, always a good sign of quality."
Merlot,"Heady aromas of pine needles, beef char, pork fat, cooked cherries, pipe tobacco and leather greet the nose on this wine by the Vondrasek brothers. There is lots of zing on the palate, with flavors of purple fruit and cracked black pepper."
Merlot,"This wine shows light aromas of blue fruit, plum and spice. The palate boasts sculpted fruit and barrel flavors, conveying a good sense of structure and balance."
Merlot,"This is a succulent and juicy red wine with pretty cherry nuances, mature prune and spice. The wine tastes slightly sweet and offers clean flavors of blueberry and bright red fruit on the close."
Merlot,"A very nice Merlot whose pure cherry, red currant and cedar flavors are supported by rich, sturdy tannins. The finish is spicy and long. Great partner with steaks and chops, and the price is right."
Merlot,"There's a rubbery denseness to this wine, a curious, not entirely pleasant mix of red currant and burnt leather that may or may not integrate over time."
Merlot,"Good balance, traditional flavors and a great price make this wine an easy-drinking gem. It tastes dry and slightly tannic in a good way that gives it texture, and has Merlot's typical plum and light herb notes."
Merlot,"Soft and herbal, this pretty, polished Merlot offers gentle flavors of cherries, currants, cola and violets, touched with oak. It's a very clean, elegant wine, meant to pair with upscale fare, and fully ready to drink now."
Merlot,"Aromas of cranberries, raspberries and herbs lead to broad rich flavors. The tannins bring a little astringency but it offers enjoyment."
Merlot,"Big, friendly and wrapped in a lot of chocolatey oak. The fruit is forward and light, and it is just big enough to hang in there with all the barrel flavors. —P.G."
Merlot,"A very good Merlot, representing a huge increase in quality over the 2008, and a return to the charms of the 2007. It's ripe and tasty in fruit, currants and sweet oak, and earns extra points for the fine structure. Ready now."
Merlot,"Sweet and herbal smelling, then firm and tight in the mouth, with clampy tannins and generic, dark flavors of black plum and berry. Feels a little reduced and heavy on the finish."
Merlot,"Dry, tart and simple, this has a flavor of sour cherry candy. A fine wine for pouring at big parties."
Merlot,"This is dry, spicy and subdued on the bouquet, with a red berry aroma leading the charge. Focused and fresh on the palate, it has spicy, mildly oaky flavors of toasty berry fruit. Pinches of pepper and chocolate add weight and darkness to the finish."
Merlot,"This captures the spicy vitality of Les Collines Merlot, with pretty cherry and plum fruit set against a smattering of new oak toast. It's a clean, well-defined wine that continues into a tasty finish with highlights of roasted walnuts and clove."
Merlot,"Juicy black fruit shines in this full-bodied wine with structured tannins. Weighty and concentrated, with light dustings of black pepper and cinnamon, its oak is supportive and seasoned in a touch of vanilla."
Merlot,"The first Merlot offering from this producer, this is 100% varietal and totally full-throttle in its fleshy components of vanilla and chocolate, seasoned in cinnamon. Fresh and somewhat floral, it's bright despite its size and lively on the palate. The wine is made in tiny amounts."
Merlot,Sonoro (100% Merlot) opens with cherry and creamy milk chocolate with ripe berry flavors of plum and cassis. A touch of green pepper or chopped herb adds brightness to the finish.
Merlot,"A tough, gritty and austerely dry Merlot that's not offering much on its own. Tastes stalky, green and minty, with rasping tannins."
Merlot,"Milk chocolate, cherry and raspberry aromas lead to sweet, supple luscious fruit flavors. It keeps you coming back for more."
Merlot,"Intensely ripe, this is a straightforward wine with upfront cherry jam and oak flavors. Not much else going on, but it's fine for a party."
Merlot,"A good Merlot that shows a fine structure, without much complexity. The wine is dry and tannic and soft, with blackberry, black cherry, plum and oak flavors. Ready now."
Merlot,"Smooth and fruity, soft and rich, this medium-bodied wine will be easy to enjoy at a casual meal or big party. The aromas are like black cherries, the flavors like candied cherries and the texture relaxed."
Merlot,"Front-loaded with cherries, violets, red currants and mocha, this Merlot isn't just about flavor. It also has depth and length, in other words a complexity that lifts it above the average. It's already throwing some sediment, suggesting that even a year or two in the bottle will help it mellow."
Merlot,"Slightly earthy and herbal smelling but with enough clean fruit on the nose to make the grade. The palate is fairly flush, with blackberry, baked notes and bitter chocolate flavors. Fleshy and warm overall, with a thick finish that's lightly peppery and toasty."
Merlot,"This Merlot gets your basic dry, full-bodied red wine job done in an inexpensive way. It has raisiny flavors and lots of crunchy acidity."
Merlot,"This wine offers good value in aromas full of violet perfume and a suggestion of cedar. Taste-wise it offers raspberry liqueur in a soft, understated package, and long, straightforward finish. A great go-to for mid-week meals and larger gatherings, it'll pair with versatility."
Merlot,"Brooding on the nose, this bottling by a newer producer shows crushed herbs, slate, leathery blackberry and blueberry fruit, smoked meats and a touch of minty tobacco. There is great structure on the palate, with fine-grained, chalky tannins presenting blackberry fruit, black-pepper spice, oak smoke and touches of crushed oregano."
Merlot,"Blended with 13% Cabernet Franc and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon, the aromas offer notes of herb, cherry and spice. The palate shows a very pretty, elegant styling that carries through the finish. It shows a touch of greenness and finishes a bit warm."
Merlot,"Brooding aromas of blackberry seed, black currant and licorice are followed by a full-bodied palate, with a tight core of dark-fruit flavors supported by fine-grained tannins. It's near irresistible, showing impeccable styling."
Merlot,"Merlot is one of the benchmark wines at this winery, wholly-owned by the Osoyoos Indians. Roasted aromas of plum and cherry don't entirely disguise a bit of funk. A year in mixed oak adds flavors of mocha and dark chocolate to rather thin fruit."
Merlot,"What this 100% Merlot lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in the sheer power of its fruit. It's rich and spicy in black cherry, milk chocolate, red licorice and oak, after being aged for 20 months in 100% new French barrels. With thick but refined tannins, it's drinkable now."
Merlot,"The winemakers speak of “wild chokecherry jam” flavors. OK. There are interesting, wild berry flavors, along with the winery's generous, milk chocolaty, oaked-up finish. Still young and knitting together, if this wine follows the path of earlier successes, it will begin to expand and fill out over the next five or six years."
Merlot,"Drink this Merlot with burgers at a party. It's dry and tannic, with some satisfying black currant, licorice and green tea flavors."
Merlot,"The aromas bring notes of milk chocolate, spice and red fruit, along with high-toned vanilla accents. The fruit and barrel flavors are plush and full, while still showing a lovely sense of balance."
Merlot,"Broadly fruity, this dark and smooth Merlot is loaded with a luscious mix of black fruits. The flavors play out in forward, accessible fashion, flecked with a pleasing minerality."
Merlot,"A very rich, full-bodied Merlot, with chocolate, blackberry jam and sweet oak flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. Offers lots of immediate pleasure."
Merlot,"Tomato, red fruit and resiny oak aromas don't exactly scream “fresh.” Feels rustic and scratchy, with herbal, sawdust and vanilla flavors clouding out any quality fruit that might exist. Not much here, really."
Merlot,"Give this wine credit for dryness, crisp acidity and intensity. It's rich and strong in sour black cherry candy, cola, bitter dark chocolate and herb flavors. It's also very tannic, so much so that it's practically undrinkable now. Give it 4–5 years in the bottle, decant, and drink with beef or lamb."
Merlot,"A controlled mix of rubber, berry, olive and leather gives this bargain hunter's wine a legitimate bouquet. The palate is herbal but also full of red fruits like currants, raspberry and plum, while the finish is mostly clean and sound. A solid wine for the price."
Merlot,"An interesting, fecund nose carries aromas of wet hay along with cherries and plums. Well-balanced and high-toned flavors are bright and set the fruit against firm tannins and a layer of loam and graphite. Give it a few years in the cellar to bring out all the complexity."
Merlot,"Though not as powerful and concentrated as the Spofford Station Syrah, this wine displays the same distinctive, complex flavor palette—a mix of earth, herb, compost, fungus, smoke, rock and, oh yeah, baby, oodles of fruit. This sort of flavor profile is similar to the biodynamic wines of Cayuse, but at half the cost."
Merlot,"Hot, soft and simple, with baked fruit flavors of cherries and red currants that turn raisiny on the finish. On the plus side, it's dry and silky."
Merlot,"Soft and pretty, this estate grown wine offers plum and cherry fruit, with notes of cedar and smoke from aging in one third new French and Hungarian oak. The structure rests on stiff but proportionate tannins, giving good balance and medium length. Drink now through 2020."
Merlot,"Girolamo is a Merlot from the southern part of Chianti Classico that does a remarkable job of being modern and delicate at the same time. On the one hand, you get rich notes of chocolate, cherry and coffee, but on the other, you get ethereal nuances of blueberry, spice and cola. Ready to drink."
Merlot,"Just what you want a California Merlot to be. It's soft in the mouth, with silky tannins framing easy flavors of cherries, red currants, mocha and cinnamon spice. Great with cheeseburgers, lamb curry, beef tartare."
Merlot,"Nowhere near ripe, with asparagus and boiled green bean aromas and flavors. Simply lacks richness of fruit."
Merlot,"Plush and dusty, this splendid Merlot offers unusual depth and texture, even for Washington versions of the much-maligned grape. Along with black cherry fruit come highlights of herb and olive, spicy oak and rich earth. The density and detail carry through a long finish."
Merlot,This wine blends Merlot from Stagecoach and Antinori vineyards on Atlas Peak with Malbec from the Trefethens in Oak Knoll and Merlot and Syrah from Hudson Vineyards in Carneros. Together the varieties provide a juicy hit of dark cherry and plum that's densely built and moderate in acidity. The finish is marked by meat and tobacco.
Merlot,"From a small parcel in the Lamothe-Vincent vineyard, this rich, structured wine shows a strong relationship with terroir and minerality. It has power and intensity, while still preserving enough freshness. Drink from 2016."
Merlot,This Merlot from Cortona features aromas that are on the ripe side and recall blackberry and strawberry preserves with accents of white peppercorn and vine-ripened tomato. The tannins are thick and sandy.
Merlot,"Mildly roasted and leafy, with dry berry aromas. This is ripe and juicy on the palate, with berry, black cherry and mocha flavors. Finishes almost creamy, with honest structure and medium-range tannins. Drink now."
Merlot,"Cocoa, herb, raspberry, vanilla and spice aromas are out front on this wine. The blue and red fruit and barrel flavors are creamy in feel and carry through the finish."
Merlot,"Although the alcohol is relatively high, it's balanced by the wine's rich and ripe fruit core and soft tannic structure. The nose needs time to fully open up, revealing intense black-plum and cherry aromas. Jammy and full on the palate, this has a hint of black pepper on the close."
Merlot,"Rich black-cherry, currant, licorice, spice and sandalwood flavors abound in this dry Merlot. It's pretty tannic, with a gum-sticking astringency. It's unlikely that this will age well, so drink it now, after decanting, and pair it with rich meats."
Merlot,"Made entirely with Merlot, the shy nose eventually reveals whiffs of violet and clove. The medium-bodied palate offers prune, vanilla and French oak alongside chewy tannins and rather modest acidity."
Merlot,"Hard to beat the delicious flavors in this mountain Merlot. It explodes in the mouth with blackberry jam, cherry liqueur, melted milk chocolate, licorice and sweet oak flavors. Pretty good in the modern style, with a minor quibble that there's some sharpness throughout."
Merlot,"This older vintage of a hot-climate Merlot is almost past its prime. The wine appears old and delivers aged notes of resin, tar and asphalt with little fruit. It has a brownish hue and tastes spicy and gritty."
Merlot,"Dark and austere, this is a mammoth Merlot with overstated coffee, chocolate, leather, tobacco, cigar and plump black cherry. Yet the aromas are not overly penetrating or immediate. It has chewy tannins and good length and would pair well with steak and Tuscan white beans."
Merlot,"Cherry, plum and earth aromas form a sound bouquet. This Merlot is full, round and well balanced. Flavors of black fruits are helped along by integrated spice and earth tones, while the finish shows ripeness and a smooth texture."
Merlot,"Burly and brawny in tar and leather, this muscular wine is showy and yet totally delicious. It's worthwhile and hard to resist in its full embrace of smoky oak, black-cherry liqueur and blackberry jam. Soft and succulent, it finishes as robust as it started—a good poster child for the oft-maligned variety."
Merlot,"Aromas are high toned and barrel-forward, with notes of vanilla, green wood and cocoa. The fruit is able to break through on the palate that shows a pleasing sense of balance."
Merlot,"Spicy aromas of green tobacco blend with plum and berry notes. This Merlot is drying and tannic on the palate. Leafy flavors are fairly green, with generic black-fruit notes keeping it afloat."
Merlot,"This has a reductive nose, with stewed blackberry giving a fruity side to the barnyard-y aromas. The flavors are earthy and savory, with some cigar box surrounding it all, but not tons of fruit."
Merlot,"The wine is ripe, rounded and with fine rich fruit. Its structure is balanced with the blackberry fruits, giving density as well as fine acidity. Drink this well-made wine from 2018."
Merlot,"Easily the best Merlot in memory from Lake County, this one stands next to anything from Napa Valley, which is just over the hill from the vineyard. Shows a gorgeous tannin structure, with ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, red currants, mocha, green olives and cedar."
Merlot,"Aromas of spice, red fruit and milk chocolate are followed by an opulent palate of fruit and barrel flavors. It appeals on every level."
Merlot,"A tremendous achievement in Merlot. The vineyard, around 1,600 feet up on Mt. Veeder, is now owned by the Jackson family, and the winemaker is Chris Carpenter, who oversees Cardinale. In fact, this Merlot bears an uncanny resemblance to Cardinale in the dramatically ripe, sweet fruit and superb, tannin-based structure. It's 100% Merlot, with hefty yet balanced alcohol, and the wine easily handles the 85% new French oak in which it was aged for 22 months."
Merlot,"The blend is complex, including Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and others, and the flavors are also complex. They include delicious red currants, jammy mulberries, spicy mocha and smoky oak. Perfectly ready for drinking now with upscale fare."
Merlot,"The vanilla, coffee, red apple and hay aromas are initially quite light and not fully in sync. The red fruit flavors are rich and full, pulling no punches."
Merlot,"Merlot remains a challenge for most Oregon producers who attempt it. This does not rise past the impression of light and grapey soda flavors, with some stiff earthy tannins."
Merlot,"This pleasant Merlot is a little tough and gritty, but it's rich and candied in blackberry and cherry, roasted almond and vanilla flavors. Give it some time to breathe in the glass."
Merlot,"Pungent clove and cinnamon appear upon entry to this medium-bodied wine, which also offers smooth, rounded tannins and subtle oak. Plum, raspberry and tobacco all make an appearance, finished off by a healthy dose of black pepper."
Merlot,"Crisp red cherry and berry notes on the nose become increasingly ruddy and ripe on the palate of this soft, medium-bodied Merlot. It's pleasantly juicy, but whiffs of ramp and dried savory herbs are a distracting contrast."
Merlot,"Pure Merlot from the Barde-Haut vineyard gives a smooth and ripely fruited wine that is now on the way to maturity. It combines soft tannins, an elegant structure and juicy acidity. The aftertaste is fruity with a more mature edge."
Merlot,"An elegant wine, with nicely framed red berry fruit flavors. Hints of dried herbs and modest tannins put everything in balanced proportion."
Merlot,"A beautiful Merlot, noble and classic. It doesn't have the stuffing for cellaring, but is absolutely lovely now, with fine, brisk tannins framing flavors of cherries, herbs and sweet oak, and a lingering finish. Easy to find, with 12,100 cases produced."
Merlot,"This is a terrific Merlot, offering structure and balance (hallmarks of all Seven Hills wines) along with rich fruits, accented with earth and herb. There is lovely density and texture at work here, plenty of black cherry fruit, and a gentle hint of composted earth."
Merlot,"Smooth, fruity and fairly deep for a basic Merlot. The palate is medium-to-full in terms of weight and bite, with ripe berry fruit and light oak notes leading to a long, chocolaty finish. Textbook everyday Chilean Merlot, which means it's pleasant and easy to drink."
Merlot,"Made in the Pride style, this is a big, powerful wine that should age well. It's enormously ripe, with flamboyant cassis, cherry pie filling, milk chocolate, licorice and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into thoroughly modern, softly refined tannins. Just beautiful, and should develop through 2012."
Merlot,"Smells and tastes like an inexpensive Aussie Shiraz, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors and a dry, peppery finish. The texture is a little syrupy and thick, but it's a good, easy wine."
Merlot,"Soft, sweet and dull, with Life-Saver candy flavors of cherries. Okay in a pinch."
Merlot,"Espresso, dark chocolate, herb and purple fruit aromas lead to a soft, smooth palate in this wine. Fruit and barrel notes play equal parts, yet it comes up short on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Given the diverse clonal make-up of the vines that go in to this Pinot, the aromas are somewhat muted and shy. Earthy, spicy fruit flavors are characterized by baked red raspberry and strawberry notes, with the wine taking on a denseness on the palate and finish."
Pinot Noir,"Comes off as a slightly skinny Pinot Noir, with herbal overtones to the cherry and strawberry flavors. Still, it's varietally true, and light enough in body to pair effectively with chicken or salmon. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is smoky, ripe and packed with tannins. The fruit gives the wine weight although it is not yet fully developed. There is a toasty background to this rich wine with its juicy red-berry fruits and acidity. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,"Juicy black cherry and strawberry flirt with this vineyard-designate's sultry and dense earthiness, combining two sides of the equation with a deft hand. Tea, sage and robust tannins give it depth and breadth across the palate, as tingling acidity keeps it fresh."
Pinot Noir,"A generously fruity, just-ripe and refined wine, this offers classic notions of the appellation in a warm, welcoming vintage, from rhubarb, cranberry and cherry to cola spice and clove. Still young, it shows an intensity that should meld and mellow in the bottle in short order."
Pinot Noir,"A good value for the quality, this wine is smooth and velvety. Easy drinking, it offers an integrated texture dotted in dark cherry, allspice and plum. Full bodied, it remains soft and approachable from start to finish."
Pinot Noir,"Dried mint, dessicated red currant, rose bud and wet slate aromas show on the fairly shy nose of this appellation blend. Game, red berry and sharper allspice notes arise on the palate. Persistent acidity makes it a good match for a variety of foods."
Pinot Noir,"This young wine seems to be just coming out of bottle shock, and initially the flavors pull up short. It's showing strawberry and red plum with a bit of milk chocolate, sourced from Whistling Ridge, Durant and Bishop Creek vineyards. Just 10% saw new French oak. Give this elegant wine another year or so to smooth out, and drink 2017 through 2020."
Pinot Noir,"Everything in this full-bodied wine comes in big helpings, from the deep garnet color to aromas of rich oak and ripe fruit, to the mouthfilling black-cherry flavors. Yet it doesn't go over the top and achieves a high-level complexity that's delicious."
Pinot Noir,"The best of a great flight of single-vineyard 2009 Pinots from Adelsheim, this new entry into the lineup is all muscle and black fruits. It is power-packed with dense, rich flavors, nuanced with exotic spices and black tea, moving into silky tannins and an extremely long, satisfying finish."
Pinot Noir,"A medley of high toned blue and red fruit mingle with dark chocolate, earth, warm stone and black olive. Fine grained tannins and a long savory finish make this a round, finessed wine capable of aging for through 2022."
Pinot Noir,"Aromas of baked sour cherry tart precede pleasing wafts of violet and lavender. From a vineyard planted largely to a field selection of the Swan clone, it offers an expected earthiness and spiciness that intrigues around a core of balanced tension between fruit, acid and oak."
Pinot Noir,"This is a darkly colored, rich wine that's uniquely savory. It floods the mouth with raspberry and cherry jam, mocha and sweet oak flavors. Best for drinking soon."
Pinot Noir,"This special selection is already showing some brick around the rim and seems to be aging rapidly. The flavors are mostly herb and root, sassafras and beet root in particular, with the fruit leaning toward Dr. Pepper soda."
Pinot Noir,"Single (777) clone, half new French oak, packed with flavor—this is ready to go. Concentrated flavors of black cherry, cola and vanilla, adorned even further with dusty sweet spices, make this a grab-and-go kind of wine. There's a lightly funky umami character to the finish, along with more barrel notes of coffee and caramel."
Pinot Noir,"This is deep and ruby in hue, while the aromas are spicy, brightly oaky and reminiscent of red cherries. Ripe yet fresh and tangy flavors recall cherries and raspberries, while a vein of darker plum comes in and lingers on the long finish. It's serious and delightful at the same time, and will age well; delicious now, but best after 2016."
Pinot Noir,"This is a big, rich style of Pinot, with toast, vanilla and bacon marking the nose. While the palate delivers more black cherry fruit, it still remains savory overall. It's slightly chewy on the finish, so drink 2017–2025."
Pinot Noir,"Fruit from the oldest blocks in this pioneering vineyard is sourced here. It's bright, spicy and focused, with forward citrus-scented Bing cherry flavors. The concentration and length are outstanding, with just the lightest suggestion of green herbs rounding out the finish."
Pinot Noir,"The vineyard is great and famous, yet the wine doesn't exhibit its best qualities. It's soft and rather direct, with flavors of cherries, raspberries, orange rind and cola, accented with sweet smoky oak. Good and silky, but could come from anywhere."
Pinot Noir,"Almost garnet red in color, this off-dry Pinot Noir sparkling packs a punch with an abundance of juicy black cherry and plum flavor. Concentrated but festive and fun, with a candy-coated cherry finish."
Pinot Noir,"This is locked up tight when opened, and remains massive but inscrutable for several hours. But that is not to say it isn't a killer wine. The dense weave of wild berries, Mediterranean herbs, earth and clay signals a powerful wine with serious aging potential. Drink 2018 through 2028."
Pinot Noir,"Tart but full cranberry aromas meld with sagebrush and cardamom on the nose of this bottling from an increasingly popular vineyard in this appellation. Baking spice and dried ginger mark the palate, which is acid-driven and lively, accenting its core of raspberry and pencil lead flavors."
Pinot Noir,"This is a fabulous example of a light, balanced wine from the Santa Lucia Highlands, which is perhaps better known for richness. It shows savory aromas of smoked cherries, nose-tickling sage, juniper-laced sausage and cayenne pepper. The palate is energetic, with a pleasant viscosity that carries its cranberry, cherry, thyme, oregano and sandalwood flavors into the finish."
Pinot Noir,"This aromatic barrel selection employs multiple clones, from a winery which lays claim to farming more Pinot Noir clones than any in Oregon. Black cherry, cola and spice combine, leading into pinpoint tannins with a pleasing sweetness from the barrel aging. Drink over the next five years."
Pinot Noir,"Strawberry and raspberry flavors are fresh and clean, not thin, but less robust than previous vintages. It's a delicate, nicely crafted wine that could be cellared through 2025."
Pinot Noir,"Generous strawberry and cherry flavors make this medium-bodied wine taste fruity and fresh, and a gentle texture buoyed by light acidity seems to match their modulated intensity. It finishes dry and with a good touch of tannin."
Pinot Noir,"This is made in a lighter, breezier style, but there's nothing light about the flavors, which suggest raspberries, grilled Canadian bacon, softened cola and smoky sandalwood. Gentle and easy, with a silky feel, this shows lots of class and elegance. Ready to drink."
Pinot Noir,"Lots of delicious, savory currant, licorice and mocha flavors in this dry Pinot that will go so well with a grilled steak. It's a bit soft and heavy, but enjoyable nonetheless."
Pinot Noir,"Firm and juicy, this Pinot has a core of berry fruit and plenty of acidity. The earthy, herbal accents are typical of this AVA. Overall, it shows fine balance and decent concentration."
Pinot Noir,"A dense, firm selection, this has layers of red fruits and acids that help to give the wine's skeleton some flesh. This is likely to develop into a rich, but always firm, wine."
Pinot Noir,"Alluring notes of Asian five spice and wet stone frame ripe cherry aromas in this medium-bodied wine. The texture is firm, becoming faintly dusty on the finish, but the wine is approachable now for its cherry fruit and appealing damp clay quality. Drink now–2018."
Pinot Noir,"This is an abundantly ripe wine, big in oak and tannin, with a streak of earthy compost. A tinge of spearmint brightens the palate, while persistent acidity graces the close."
Pinot Noir,"From an interior subregion of Hawke's Bay, this shows classic oak-aged Pinot aromas of cherries, brown sugar and baking spices. It's medium in weight, with a suede-like texture and a savory, mocha-tinged finish. This is already showing a hint of bricking at the rim, so drink it over the next few years."
Pinot Noir,"Unmistakably a Kiwi Pinot Noir, with notes of Dr. Pepper, ripe bramble fruit, oaky spices and tree bark, it loses it's way a little on the palate, lacking the juicy fruit to stand up to all the oak."
Pinot Noir,"This is a full-bodied and full-flavored wine with rich and deep aromas, ripe fruit flavors and a texture that feels substantial but polished. It starts with black cherry and woodsy aromas, then goes to lively but broad cherry, plum and nutmeg notes. The finish stays flavorful and dry."
Pinot Noir,"There's a strong sense of aromatic wood on the nose of this wine, with chaparral scrub and fennel stalks giving character to the raspberry, hibiscus and pomegranate fruit. The cooked herbs extend to the palate, where woody sage and pencil shavings spice up dark purple fruit."
Pinot Noir,"With its intense red fruits and acidity, this initially seems so fruity. Slowly the powerful structure comes into play, yielding a concentrated, cellar-worthy wine."
Pinot Noir,"There's a funkiness to this full-bodied wine, from undetermined provenance within the county. Thick in black cherry, it's straightforward and not fussy."
Pinot Noir,"Some Sonoma Coast Pinots are dark, heavy and dense, and this is one of them. It's so rich and full-bodied in black cherry, raspberry and currant fruit, it's almost like a Rhône wine. Defines a certain style, and delicious at that, but not likely to age, so drink now."
Pinot Noir,"With tangy acidity and complex flavors, this is easily the best of Baxter's three 2009 releases. The raspberry and cherry flavors vie with an earthier note of mushroom, and there's a savory edge of balsam and cola. The oak is evident, but has been adroitly applied. Dry and silky, this is capable of aging for several years in a cellar."
Pinot Noir,"This limited-production wine is complex and savory, and it features notes of beets, sous bois and cherries, layered with touches of creamy cocoa and coffee. It's on the full-bodied side of things, but it remains supple and shows great focus on the lengthy finish. Drink now and over the next few years."
Pinot Noir,"Thick tannins obscure some of the richer flavors trying to burst through in this wine, a mix of blackberry, black olive and cedar. Full bodied and generous in every way, it finishes with a slow drag of smoke."
Pinot Noir,"This is a style of Pinot Noir that needs to be drunk chilled. It brings out the smoky, stalky character of the wine that dominates the bitter cherry fruits. It's still young and needs another year to come together."
Pinot Noir,"Despite amazingly luscious aromas of star anise, stewed black cherry, black currant pie and coffee cake, this bottling still offers a prominent line of wet gravel and river stone minerality on the nose. Exotic mulberry and black cherry flavors ride atop the soft tannins and an underlying acidity, while white pepper dust and menthol unfold on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Woodsy and thickly textured, this Weir Pinot is balanced in just-ripe cherry goodness that neatly scrapes the edge of sour-ness. Fine earth and herbal overtones show off its varietal qualities, more typical of its warmer climate than the Deep End of Anderson Valley."
Pinot Noir,"Spice and mint dominate this intensely aromatic wine. Solid and very structured, it is still showing its wood aging and extraction. But its bright future is certain, with the weight of black fruits, the firm tannins and the mineral texture. Guard this wine and don't drink before 2020."
Pinot Noir,"A charming wine with lots of Pinot character. Flavors range from cherries and berries to rose, tobacco, coffee and peppery spice. A little on the thin side, it's very light and soft in the mouth, and is not built for age. But it's fun and enjoyable now."
Pinot Noir,"Light tomato and earth scents accent berry fruit aromas. The palate has a snappy, healthy feel, while flavors of tomato sauce, stewed plum and herbs finish with rooty spice notes."
Pinot Noir,Cherries and strawberries abound in this elegant wine. Old-vine fruit was fermented and briefly aged in neutral barrels that somehow lend a subtle hint of apple-pie spices to the wine. A perfect late summer sipper.
Pinot Noir,"Though labeled simply “Oregon,” this is 100% Hyland vineyard fruit from the McMinnville AVA. Done in a refined, lightly smoky style, it pushes subtle berry flavors into a substantial midpalate laden with highlights of milk chocolate, café crème and a touch of caramel. Smooth as silk, this will be tough to ignore in your cellar, though it will reward another three to five years of bottle age."
Pinot Noir,"Faint cranberry and incense aromas show on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers more flavors, including coffee, black tar, pomegranate and peppercorns."
Pinot Noir,"This  Pinot Noir has deep flavors of cherry and persimmon, plus a lush application of sweet oak. It has a sandpaper-like mouthfeel, and it might benefit from a few years in a cellar. Otherwise, decant it for a couple hours before serving."
Pinot Noir,"A delight to drink, with bright cherry and cola flavors nuanced with earthier tones of tobacco, rosehip tea and anise. The way the wine feels in the mouth is beautiful, all silk and satin. This balanced Pinot Noir defines elegance, and should improve for a few years."
Pinot Noir,"Grapes from this tiny AVA frequently deliver that something extra that catapults Pinot into a higher dimension. Here, solid cherry and berry tones bear almost indefinable traces of iron, mineral and sweet hay. Delicious already, this should continue to improve through 2020."
Pinot Noir,"Young and vibrant, this is the winery's smaller production from a special selection of barrels. A soft, burly expression of strawberry, raspberry and ripe boysenberry, it is accentuated by generous portions of toasty oak and baking spices, a faint hint of dried herb on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"This is a big, ripe, oaky Pinot Noir. Considering how cold the vintage was, it was quite an achievement to produce such powerful raspberry, cherry and plum fruit flavors. The wine is dry, elegantly tailored and vibrant in acidity, and should peak by 2017."
Pinot Noir,"This is a light and fruity wine with red-currant fruit and a crisp texture. Coteaux Bourguignons is one of the Burgundy regional appellations that offers, as here, bright fruity wines that are ready to drink young."
Pinot Noir,"A drop in alcohol by more than a full percent since the excellent 2009 Nysa was released suggests that this vintage did not achieve optimal ripeness. Bitter upon entry, with a medicinal note, this remains stiff and unyielding, with tart cranberry fruit and sharp acids."
Pinot Noir,"A layered, somewhat delicate nose of rose petals, purple flowers, cola spice and raspberry-laced chocolate serves as the introduction to this bottling. Cherry, cranberry and raspberry emerge subtly on the sip, lifted by potpourri and sagebrush that fit into a chalky and tight structure. This will age very well."
Pinot Noir,"Shows the clean, citrus acid juiciness and silky texture of the appellation and is totally dry. But you'll find ripe cherry, currant, pomegranate, peppermint tea, mineral and smoky oak flavors that finish complex and satisfying. Brilliant and versatile at the table."
Pinot Noir,"The dynamic nose of this bottling from a longtime ranching family in Monterey County pops with black raspberry, candied pomegranate and rose petal aromas. Fresh red fruit as well as darker baked raspberry flavors show on the palate, which is lifted by white pepper touches."
Pinot Noir,"Bay Area biotech scientist-turned-vintner Kristie Tacey offers a solid wine with sandalwood, pomegranate and a slight bitterness on the nose. The palate also shows pomegranate along with rhubarb, backed up by graphite minerality and brown spice throughout."
Pinot Noir,"A sumptuous wine from a vintage that is fruity and generous. It does show some of the structure of the appellation, but the juicy cherry and ripe strawberry flavors dominate. It's going to develop into a rich and early-maturing wine. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,"Unctuous and earthy, this medium-bodied wine is more about subtle and savory herb notes than deep fruit. With its light fruit characteristics and bold spice elements, it will make a versatile choice for the table."
Pinot Noir,"Nearly always B-C's top wine or close to it, this quintessential hilltop vineyard combines power and finesse with sheer deliciousness of flavor. Silky and dry, the wine shows an earthy spiciness that undergirds ripe tastes of red cherries, pomegranates and cola. Best now and through 2012."
Pinot Noir,"This drinkable Pinot does have a tannic toughness. On the palate, there are good notes of cherry and cola, but hints of green unripeness compromise its future. Give it a good decant and drink now."
Pinot Noir,"This is a tiny production wine, nutty on the nose in almond paste and an intensity of forest floor and earth. Still gritty in its youth, it shows a soft and delicate nature at its core, accented in rose petal and a persistent streak of minerality complemented by a richness of deep dark red cherry."
Pinot Noir,"Strawberry and raspberry fruit carry a nice touch of bright spice, notably saffron. Some 30% new French oak was used, and the wine expresses it with highlights of toasted coconut. The wine has medium concentration and length, and will benefit from aggressive aeration."
Pinot Noir,"Half of the wine was fermented with native yeasts, and 30% saw new oak. What shines is the juicy, fresh, delicious fruit—a jumble of raspberries and cherries—plus the finish, which hangs deliciously."
Pinot Noir,"A proper, textbook Pinot Noir—it's dry, nicely crisp, with smoothly astringent tannins. It has pleasant, complex cherry, pomegranate, plum, tobacco, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Not an ager, so drink up with upscale fare."
Pinot Noir,"The producer ferrets out some of the best from the appellation, combining 75% of the grapes for this wine from Hudson Vineyards and the remainder from Hyde Vineyards. An inaugural release, it's a showcase of stemmy earth and rose petals set against an ethereal backdrop. Baked rhubarb adds further flavor, seasoned in clove."
Pinot Noir,"Notshowing much generosity now, pinched by tough tannins that give it a scoury astringency. Deep inside is a molten core of cherries and cola, with complex earth, mushroom and mineral notes. Pretty soft, but dry and focused, and could age well. Try after 2014."
Pinot Noir,"Smoky and aromatic, this wine shows great fruitiness against dark, structured tannins. Raspberries and black cherries are layered with wood, spice and final intense acidity. Drink this still-firm wine from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"Longtime San Francisco Giant Rich Aurilia teams with fellow baseballer Dave Roberts to produce a wine with restrained, focused aromas of black cherry, pencil shavings, sarsaparilla and hints of allspice. The palate is all about black gravel and turned loam, with tiny bits of black cherry and noticeably firm tannins."
Pinot Noir,"Seemingly light and elegant, this conveys the cherrylike, cinnamonlike flavors and vibrant balance that Pinot should. It is actually medium to full-bodied, quite smooth but with a touch of acidity to keep it appetizing. This could well improve with age, considering its great balance. Best now–2019."
Pinot Noir,"This soft, fruity wine is pretty much ready to drink. With its red-berry fruits and fresh acidity it has a crisp side, although its round, ripe texture is so attractive. Drink from the end of 2016."
Pinot Noir,"A first-rate Pinot Noir, dry and firm in structure. There's a solid minerality girding the ripe cherry, red currant and cola fruit, while sweet oak provides an ample, but balanced, coating of vanilla and toast. Luscious now right out of the bottle, and should age for a good eight years."
Pinot Noir,"Subtle, intricate aromas and equally sophisticated flavors of baking spices, tamarind and cherries make this a fascinating wine to taste. It's full bodied but lithe. Energizing acidity and firm tannins give it great structure and help carry the complex flavors through a lingering finish."
Pinot Noir,"You'll find this Pinot Noir drier, earthier, tarter and even more tannic than most coastal bottlings. It has flavors of cherry skins, black raspberries, cola, peppery spices and herbs. Drink now–2010."
Pinot Noir,"A super-fruity, direct Pinot, rather one-dimensional in cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors. Dry and crisp, with a silky texture, it's a good wine to drink now."
Pinot Noir,"From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents. The tactile acidity once sipped creates a fascinating soft buzz on the tongue, with flavors of dried mint, brisk raspberry and cherry tomato. Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"This distinctive wine has a light to medium color, with complex and somewhat earthy aromas. Very tasty and diverse flavors suggest black tea and rhubarb. It has medium body, a soothing, smooth texture and lingering finish."
Pinot Noir,There is a touch of minerality in this wine as well as a dry edge and ripe red-fruit flavors that are already attractive. It should be aged at least three years.
Pinot Noir,"Fresh, fruity cherry, citrus and rose aromas are light and airy. This feels a bit raw and scratchy, while currant, red plum and brown sugar flavors finish juicy, snappy and uncushioned. This has all the requirements of a good picnic Pinot Noir."
Pinot Noir,"Faint notes of strawberry rise from the glass; on the palate they become more subdued and meld into fresh, citrusy notes of grapefruit. The combination of fine fizz, grown-up dryness and spiky citrus is absolutely convincing, even mouth-watering."
Pinot Noir,"The flavors are quite tart, tannic and leafy, and the wine gives the impression of coming from very young vines. That said, it's got snap and verve, and the fruit flavors are bright and forward, the herbal flavors clean and green. This would be an ideal poultry wine."
Pinot Noir,"This wine delivers a fresh hit of zesty acidity and earthiness that balance each other well, that liveliness a good match against more brooding aspects of black tea. Light bodied with just enough weight on the palate, it finishes with tastes of wild raspberry and strawberry."
Pinot Noir,"This is a rich, soft wine with jammy black fruits and ripe tannins. The acidity will hold the wine together and allow it to age. A mineral edge comes from the caillou (stones) in the soil—hence the wine's name. It will age, although quickly, so drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"Dark and heavy for a Pinot Noir, although it's certainly well made and delicious. Floods the mouth with cherry and raspberry pie-filling fruit, and the smoky, caramelized oak has a granola sweetness. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"In 2007 the winery's Estate bottling seems to capture a bit more nuance and detail than the reserve, though admittedly it does not have quite the same concentration. For those who prize finesse, this is the wine of the vintage. Herbal and resiny, it's like sniffing a fine wine in a pine forest. It balances raspberry and sour cherry fruit with the tart and herbal “wild” side of Oregon Pinot. Penetrating and complex."
Pinot Noir,"This new cuvée brings forward, spicy, peppery fruit centered around cranberry flavors. The back end tannins turn earthy, and take the shine off the finish. Perhaps a bit more bottle age will open it up."
Pinot Noir,"Steve Dooley heads a bit south from his San Luis Obispo winery for grapes from this historic vineyard, producing a wine with scents of fresh pomegranate, black plums, sweet sage and graphite. The palate shows squeezed red cherry fruit that grows in complexity with sagebrush and pine sap elements."
Pinot Noir,"Warm aromas of red cherries, star anise and cinnamon greet the nose with inviting brown spice scents on this entry-level bottling. Cinnamon, cranberry and black plum show on the palate, along with pencil-lead minerality and a tart plum-skin finish."
Pinot Noir,"Jammy in blackberry, raspberry and mulberry flavors, this Pinot has more exotic notes of sautéed wild mushrooms sprinkled with soy sauce, anisette, pine tar and pepper. But its dominating qualities are dryness, acidity and tannins. Feels too young and unresolved for pleasure now. Give it a few years."
Pinot Noir,"Ethereally light with delicate red cherry flavor, this Pinot is soft, complex and interesting, with a racy herbal streak lurking in the background. Think a ham-and-cheese quiche gingerly sprinkled with thyme and oregano. So distinctive, one wonders what grows near this particular set of vines on the Wentzel Vineyard."
Pinot Noir,"Although plummy fruit dominates the nose, if you take an extra moment or two you can ferret out a lot more: mint, leather and vanilla, for example. The flavors feature a wintergreen component that adds a welcome degree of individuality to this offering, before fading into a medium-length finish."
Pinot Noir,"Loaded with dark cherry earth, this is a dense, drinkable Pinot Noir. From a tiny Watsonville-based producer who sources from all over the state to make a handful of different wines."
Pinot Noir,"This challenging island vineyard, planted in 2007, delivers a stunningly delicate but ripe wine, with aromas of smashed cranberry and strawberry pairing perfectly to sarsaparilla and sautéed oyster mushroom elements. The continually emerging palate shows dried citrus peels, iron and sour cherries, along with riper raspberry and pomegranate juice flavors and a spicy edge."
Pinot Noir,The pure scent of freshly picked strawberries is as enticing on the nose as it is on the palate. The gentle flavors are supported by bright lemony freshness and a frothy fizzy mousse that accentuates the purity of these primary flavors perfectly. All of this spells lightness and ease. The finish is dry and full of strawberry notes.
Pinot Noir,"Plum, sassafras and dark cherry form a contingency of flavor in this brooding, velvety smooth wine with a sizable finish. Cinnamon and clove are peppered throughout this full-bodied, well-made effort from the famous vineyard site."
Pinot Noir,"This Pinot saw one-quarter new oak, which contributed an undertone of burnt toast. The spicy berry fruit is accented by a cola note, and the wine has a friendly, mouth-filling roundness. This is perfect for near term drinking."
Pinot Noir,"A bitter streak of herbal tea seasons a tight grip of tannin in this mountainous wine, structured and burly in wild sage and black cherry. A smoky undercurrent adds intrigue and savory, meaty notes that should be paired with appropriately hearty fare."
Pinot Noir,"The winery's value bottling, this was vinified in a mix of neutral oak and stainless steel. Enjoy soon for its pretty mix of savory herb, black cherry and molasses flavors."
Pinot Noir,"Pale and a bit rusty in color, this modest little wine offers nothing beyond faint pine and earth aromas and herbal, tomato-like flavors."
Pinot Noir,"This is a firm style of wine, showing the mineral character of Pernand-Verglesses reds. The wine has a nervy, almost herbal profile, showing red currants and considerable acidity."
Pinot Noir,"A reductive, bitter rubber component stubbornly dominates this wine. There's cranberry and rhubarb fruit, ample acids, and otherwise all is in balance. But that burnt rubber note carries right through the finish. Two bottles were tasted with similar results."
Pinot Noir,"Full bodied, savory and retentive of tannin and oak, this is a robust, rich and ripe wine, with a tang of dark cherry, cola and vanilla. Youthful, it has ample acidity to keep it fresh in the glass, but allow it to open over time."
Pinot Noir,"This is a toasty, tasty, forward and easy-drinking Pinot Noir. Flavors of black cherry soda, cola and light toast are front and center, and the finish comes on clean and refreshing."
Pinot Noir,"A generic expression of the variety with some notions of ripe plum, dark cherry and black pepper, this straightforward wine is ready to drink now. It takes on full tannic strength on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"This is a new single-vineyard bottling for Goldeneye, grown in the cooler Deep End western part of the valley. It's a feral kind of Pinot. Not for it the tame fruit of warmer climates. This one brims with wild berries: cherries, raspberries, something animal and leathery, and mossy tastes of balsam and tar. For all that explosion, the wine's tannins and acids keep it controlled and balanced, and it never loses its silky lightness. Best now and for six years or so."
Pinot Noir,"From a six-acre site further inland than many of the producer's other sources, this wine shines in classic coastal expression nonetheless. It presents a mix of earthy, stemmy forest and black tea, with a touch of reduction and lightness of oak and power. Delicately textured, it delivers a refined style."
Pinot Noir,"In the Villa Maria style, this is an amply endowed Pinot Noir, but it also shows excellent balance—the dark plum and cola fruit is matched in intensity by crisp acids and firm tannins, suggesting a few years in the cellar wouldn't hurt. Drink 2010–2016."
Pinot Noir,"A single barrel is all that is made. A burst of pure ripe strawberry and cherry fruit resonates across the palate, flavors glowing like light from a candle. It's lovely but ephemeral, without much weight or complexity."
Pinot Noir,"This is a rich, robust Pinot Noir, defining the big, tannic style. It explodes in cherry, cola and pomegranate fruit flavors, with the added note of caramelized oak. You can drink this wine now, but it should hold in the bottle for 6–8 years, gradually mellowing. The vineyard is in the cooler southern part of the valley, near Carneros."
Pinot Noir,"One of the Talley family's more affordable bottlings, this is a great choice for weeknight sipping or bringing to neighborhood parties. Aromas of dried cherries meet with forest floor, wet thyme and chipped slate on the nose, while the palate offers light cran-raspberry, dried herbs and a menthol finish on a decently acidic structure."
Pinot Noir,"From vineyards owned by the Gagey family, this wine is ripe, easy to drink and full of fruit. Its strawberry and red cherry flavors are lifted by acidity and grounded in balancing tannins. It is made to be drunk young and will be ready from late 2017."
Pinot Noir,"Arbor Brook's estate-grown Pinot Noir brings a very expressive mix of cranberry, raspberry, black cherry, moist earth, pencil lead and chalk to the palate. A little bit of green tea, a little bit of herb, a little bit even of stem is just fine when set against natural acids and tart, tangy fruit. Elegance is what Pinot Noir should be about, and that is what is delivered here."
Pinot Noir,"If ripe, jammy fruit is what you like in an Oregon Pinot, this is your baby. A generous amount of strawberry and cherry flavor is wrapped in a cloak of chocolate from 14+ months in 60% new French oak."
Pinot Noir,"The first Reserve released by Parducci, this is dripping with bright cherry and strawberry flavors, and it has an earthy undertone. A trace of spice lingers on the palate."
Pinot Noir,"A small-production Pinot that's earthy in just-picked strawberry, this offers light color and smooth, soft, silky tannins that have integrated well, though the wine remains young and fresh in the glass. It becomes weightier on the finish, expressing just the right amount of oak."
Pinot Noir,"Reflecting the difficulties of the vintage, this is a slightly edgy, coarsely textured wine, with sweet, oaky notes framing cherries and roasted beets. Try it with something slightly rustic, like beef stew."
Pinot Noir,"This estate reserve wine has more texture and length than their regular estate Pinot Noir, and displays varietal flavors mixing rubarb, strawberry and raspberry preserves.  Some spicy herb adds life to the mid-palate, finishing with a bit of mint."
Pinot Noir,"Still young, this is a dark wine with blueberry fruit and firm tannins both on display. It has concentration and the potential for juiciness and richness that will develop. A structured wine, it needs more time. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"This very rich, ripe and forward Pinot Noir can be opened now for its vast array of raspberries, cherries, cola, red licorice and smoky sandalwood. It grows more interesting as it warms in the glass, showing facets of pomegranates and violets. Will provide good drinking through 2014."
Pinot Noir,"Generous, abundant, ripe fruit flavors and a tasty touch of spicy oak make a fine combo in this medium-bodied, plush-textured wine. With repeated sips the fruit flavors taste even more intricate and interesting. The texture firms up nicely due to fine tannins and welcome acidity. While tempting to drink now, this will be best after 2018."
Pinot Noir,"Comes from a little-understood part of the sprawling Sonoma Coast, a place near San Pablo Bay yet to prove itself. There are ripe, rich, young vine flavors of cherry pie and cola, with a very sharp bite of tartness. Think of opulence versus acidity. Hard to tell which side wins. Drink now, for fresh, jammy fruitiness."
Pinot Noir,"This big, dense wine is dark in color, with lush, late-picked aromas and flavors and very full body. Its power and oozing fruitiness make quite a contrast with more elegant styles, but there is no denying the appeal of all that jammy blackberry and blackcurrant character."
Pinot Noir,"From a well-regarded vineyard that's source to several Pinots comes this fine '06. It's silky and dry and crisp and young, with raspberry and cherry jam flavors complexed with smoky oak, green tea and peppery spice. Should age well for the next six years."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is an interesting journey from sniff to sip. Aromas of condensed pomegranate, hibiscus and red plum are lifted by crushed slate, light clove, marjoram and a whiff of smoke. Full flavors of red plum and cranberry start the palate, then come waves of herbaceous oregano, thyme and pepper, before the red fruit returns toward the finish."
Pinot Noir,"This wine has intense and complex flavors while keeping a graceful texture and great balance between acidity, body and tannins. Aromas suggest raspberries and strawberries with hints of pine forest and earth, while the flavors are vivid and bright."
Pinot Noir,"This is a serviceable, soft and widely distributed wine, yeasty with aromas of baked bread circling concentrated red fruit and black tea. Light bodied and youthful, it holds on to oak and tannin on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Just one barrel was made of this reserve. At first the new oak shines through, then as it opens out the wood becomes less noticeable and a complex array of spice, stem and iron filings comes into play. The fruit is light and textural, showing hints of sassafras and even a whiff of petrol."
Pinot Noir,"Sultry aromas of black plum, violet, lava rocks, smoke, caramelized beef, forest floor and star anise draw the nose into this hearty, well-rounded wine. There is both vibrant energy and tannic grip to the palate, with dense, dark cranberry, tangy fruit skins, a touch of vanilla and a minty fennel element on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"From a cool spot planted within classic Goldridge soils, this wine opens with smoky graham cracker and soft red and blue berry fruit. Black tea and clove speak to its site, providing intriguingly exotic and savory undertones that meld well with the fruit and oak. Still young, the wine needs to open for full effect."
Pinot Noir,"Smooth and silky, this seductive wine is absolutely loaded with flavors of cherry and chocolate. It's irresistible, and probably at or near its peak drinking window, as it affords maximum pleasure in a luscious, palate-coating style."
Pinot Noir,The wine has a good structure with sophisticated tannins and perfumed acidity. Black cherry and spice from the wood are balanced by the freshness of the acidity and the rounded aftertaste. Drink from 2019.
Pinot Noir,"This wine from Benjamin Silver is peaking right now, with fascinating aromas of exotic red fruits, sesame oil, maple syrup, hoisin sauce, Korean BBQ spareribs and smoked, coffee-crusted meats. It's in your face on the palate too, with pomegranate and rhubarb ripeness mixing into espresso and meatiness."
Pinot Noir,"This vineyard-designate rocks its way into your heart, opening in spicy, soft aromas of cinnamon stick and dark, luscious fruit and toasted oak. Medium in body with a light finish, it teases along the way in fragrant rose petals and orange blossom."
Pinot Noir,"A little harsh in the mouth, with minty, peppery flavors and tart acids, but you'll find enough cherry and cola flavor to satisfy, and the structure is silky and light."
Pinot Noir,"This is a ripe wine, soft on the normal tannins of this appellation and big on the black-cherry and berry fruits. It does have a firm core, cushioned by the generous fruitiness. Drink this wine from 2020."
Pinot Noir,"A fine, spicy Pinot Noir, elegant and silky. There's lots of candied raspberry, cherry, orange zest and persimmon fruit and caramelized oak, so the wine tastes almost sweet, but it's actually dry."
Pinot Noir,"A little ungainly at first blush, with tannicly sharp elbows and some green, minty flavors. But it shows some pretty cherries and spices, and is dry and silky."
Pinot Noir,"Very true to the variety, this is a soft, barnyardy, raspberry flavored wine. With its ripe fruit and well integrated tannins, it has a smooth mouthfeel that is freshened with acidity on the finish."
Pinot Noir,This easy-to-enjoy wine from the family of Silver Oak has lots of vanilla and fruit flavors and a broad but soft mouthfeel. Hints of cinnamon and red cherries come out on the palate and linger on the finish.
Pinot Noir,"The mature vines in the name of the wine are 40-years-old. The result is a firm structured wine although one with plenty of soft red fruits in the background. They are developing well, bringing with them acidity and good potential. Drink this wine from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"The vineyard is located in the western part of Sonoma County, near the little town of Freestone. The cool 2011 vintage lends mouthwatering acidity to the wine, brightening flavors of red apples, pomegranates and persimmons. Right now, it's juvenile and tight, with primary fruits that are unintegrated with oak. Give it at least eight years in the cellar, and it could be going strong at the age of fifteen."
Pinot Noir,"Of all Roessler's 2007 Pinots this is the only one that's overripe. It strikes you with a Porty aroma, an impression confirmed when you taste the raisiny flavors. Ready now."
Pinot Noir,"This is the definition of a lovely Russian River Pinot that's ready to drink soon. It's silky in the mouth, with light tannins and brisk acidity framing savory flavors of raspberries, cola and toast. A rich streak of mushroomy earthiness adds to the attraction."
Pinot Noir,You'll have to look in the very lower left hand corner of the back label to spot the vintage on this bottle (2014). The soft cherry fruit has a buttery mouthfeel. The wine is lightly toasty and eminently accessible. Drink now through 2020.
Pinot Noir,"Law enforcement veteran-turned-winemaker Cindy Cosco named this brand for her Italian roots, and presents violet, red cherry and pencil-lead aromas in this bottling. A wild-herb character powers the palate, with bay leaf most prominent, followed by tart elderberries and orange-peel sourness. The grippy palate will open more with age."
Pinot Noir,"This medium-bodied, small-production red was given a light touch of oak, only 25% of it new and French, allowing the other characteristics to speak louder than the wood. Compact tannins support a juicy, youthfully grippy frame of pomegranate and orange that opens further in the glass."
Pinot Noir,"Steely and tight, this block selection reveals a chalky flavor of citric acid that overshadows the fruit, which turns thin in the finish. Ample aeration helps a bit."
Pinot Noir,"A wine that is ripe and relatively soft. It does offer some dense tannins, but these are surrounded by rich black plum and ripe berry fruits. The structure comes from wood aging and fruit as much as from tannins. The final flavors are delicious, smoky and toasty."
Pinot Noir,"This is an earthy, minty, tart and taut wine, worthy of its appellation. It offers light-bodied notions of black tea, cranberry and rhubarb."
Pinot Noir,"This old vines Pinot has an unusual strength of flavor. It's easily the most powerful of Lynmar's new Pinots, with deep, brooding cherry and red currant flavors that have been concentrated to syrupy intensity like a boiled-down fruit-wine sauce. It's impressive, but intensely rich. Give it 5–6 years to see if things change."
Pinot Noir,"More structure and less fruit is the characteristic of this wine. A dry core is very present, giving a tough edge at this stage. There are the hints of red fruits and powerful acidity that will develop. With its weight, this is a wine for the long term. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,"Candied—almost confected—red fruit shimmers on the nose. On the palate, this turns into fleshy aromatic red cherry that carries immediate charm. The palate is light, refreshing and full of easy fruit. The finish is clean and reinforces that lovely cherry note."
Pinot Noir,"This has both a rich structure and rich fruit. The tannins comes first, dark and concentrated with spice and a dry core. After it, the ripe and juicy black fruit is layered with dense acidity. Together these two elements make for a concentrated wine that will age. Drink from 2020."
Pinot Noir,"Maybe the friendliest Hirsch bottling, this wine has wonderful complexity, medium body and a broad supple texture that make it a pleasure to taste. It has spicy lightly earthy aromas, plenty of raspberry, red cherry and rhubarb for fruit flavors, and a good sense of layering on the palate, followed by a long finish."
Pinot Noir,"A lean and clean specimen with basic but familiar raspberry and cherry aromas. The palate is a little thin and acidic, but with that comes freshness. Flavors of cherry and mixed herbs are good but sharp, while a light dusting of pepper covers the lean, snappy finish."
Pinot Noir,"Ripe raspberry juice is spiced heavily with cloves rendered in butter and flashes of black pepper on this wine by Adam Lee. It's fresh and flavorful on the powerful palate, with lots of black spice, vibrant berry juice and fresh thyme on the edges. This wine is alive with energy and verve."
Pinot Noir,"Fragrant, with notes of ripe cherry and strawberry, this brisk, bright Pinot Noir is delicately framed, but juicy with nervy sour-cherry and cranberry flavors. Drying tannins make this an elegant food wine to pair with even robust poultry or pork dishes."
Pinot Noir,"This barrel selection evokes the AVA's black-cherry fruit character nicely, keeping it lively and balanced, with excellent depth. Tasting the wine is like gazing into a deep pool; the flavors keep pushing further into the finish. Streaks of coffee and milk chocolate are in the mix, but it's the excellent fruit that captures your attention and holds it."
Pinot Noir,"It's hard to imagine any Pinot Noir being richer or riper than this one, which is made from a blend of vineyards from throughout the county's cooler areas. It's explosive with jammy raspberries, cherries, boysenberries and pomegranates, along with plenty of new French oak for buttery, toasty complexities. It will hold for a year or three."
Pinot Noir,"A delicate expression of power and beauty, this conveys kirsch cherry, wet stone and high-toned minerality. Round and easy to love, it offers a subtle streak of tannin and tight, integrated oak, finishing in dark chocolate and orange."
Pinot Noir,"This wine lays on the vanilla, cream and butter flavors along with a seeming sweetness and smooth texture due to soft effervescence and apparently low acidity. It's very flavorful and plays outside the bounds of traditional sparkling wine."
Pinot Noir,"All the parts are here to make this Pinot a lovely companion to appropriate beef, pork and game dishes, especially if wild mushrooms are involved. The wine is utterly dry and bright in acidity, and the tannins are fairly thick for a Pinot Noir. The black cherry, pomegranate, leather, black pepper and sandalwood flavors are appealing now, but the wine should develop bottle complexity until 2020."
Pinot Noir,"Lean and minty. Despite a certain elegance, this Pinot lacks the voluptuous richness you want in a wine of this price. The chilly vintage seems to have taken its toll. There's some good cherry and currant fruit, but the wine falls short. Drink up."
Pinot Noir,"This wine shows a tough unripeness that makes it hard to appreciate. There's a green peppercorn edge to the raspberries and cherries that accentuates the dryness and acids, and makes the tannins feel metallic. Still, it does display Bien Nacido elegance. Hard to see this wine aging, so drink soon."
Pinot Noir,"So delicious and easy to drink, it's complexities are almost unappreciated. Lush, ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors flatter the palate, finished with smoky toast and exotic spices. Extra points for crisp acidity and lovely tannins."
Pinot Noir,"Coming from a singular vineyard along the Mendocino coast, this wine has smoky savory flavors that complement the just-ripe fruit flavors and give a truly maverick but easy-to-enjoy personality. It is medium bodied, velvet textured, and has good structure, fine-grained tannins and enough concentration for a lingering finish."
Pinot Noir,"A feminine, almost soft Pinot Noir, this opens nicely with scents of roses, red fruits, and pine forest. Despite its light color, it has plenty of grip and density in the mouth, even bringing some streaks of light milk chocolate into the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Woody, herbal and resplendent in forest-floor pine and sandalwood, this is a complex, earthy and medium-bodied wine. It's low in oak, and revelatory in cool-climate seductions of pomegranate, cranberry and rhubarb compote. The finish is all black tea, with still-developing tannin structure and power."
Pinot Noir,"Although it is not entirely laced together, this substantial wine makes a good impression with its ripe purple fruits and strong vanilla and coffee and coconut barrel notes. Big flavors and firm tannins create an impression of strength and weight; what the wine lacks in finesse it makes up for in muscle. It's chunky and rough-hewn, but carries plenty of flavor. Screwcap."
Pinot Noir,"Produced from 65-year-old vines, this is a rich and perfumed wine from the estate of Nicolas Potel. It is structured, balancing the red fruits and acidity with a solid framework of tannins. Spice from the wood aging shows lightly, while the wine finishes with crisp red-currant acidity."
Pinot Noir,"Sanguine and velvety, this richly derived wine made from one clone of Pinot Noir is tannic in black cherry, cinnamon and tar, with a lean, mid-length finish."
Pinot Noir,"This silky, medium-bodied Pinot Noir represents much of what Marlborough Pinot has to offer: generous cherry fruit, modest complexity largely imparted by oak and supple tannins, all at a reasonable tariff. Drink now–2018."
Pinot Noir,"Although this is from the Sonoma Coast appellation, it's high elevation, so the vineyard is often above the fog that plagues the lower Russian River Valley. As a result, the wine is quite ripe and forward in jammy raspberries, cherries, licorice and cola. New French oak adds the usual smoky, vanilla accents."
Pinot Noir,"Though not as concentrated as many examples from this AVA, this brings identifiable Pinot Noir character, albeit in a rather thin, austere style. Pale cranberry and pomegranate fruit is matched to tart acidity and a veneer of herb."
Pinot Noir,"Light raspberry-sorbet notes meet with fresh fennel fronds, pepper and cinnamon on the nose of this bottling from Chad Melville and family. It's tight and tart on the palate, with dried cranberry, pine needle and eucalyptus flavors that juxtapose with the more fruit-driven nose."
Pinot Noir,"Pretty good for its price, this wine shows classic Pinot character in its light, silky mouthfeel and zesty flavors of cherry and ripe persimmon. Although it's a little too sweet, many consumers will like that."
Pinot Noir,"Fully mature, this light-bodied Pinot should be consumed before the end of 2017. Scents of cola and earth add interest to cherry fruit, ending with lingering acids."
Pinot Noir,"Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit is at the heart of this bright, quaffable and value-priced wine. There's a light dusting of pepper also, but it's the fresh fruit that stands out."
Pinot Noir,"Red cherry, red currant, mushroom and sandalwood flavors mark this appealing wine. Bone dry, with good acidity, it's a fine wine to drink now, but it should also age for quite some time, without necessarily gaining in complexity."
Pinot Noir,"This is all Pommard clone Pinot from a vineyard in the McMinnville AVA. It's loaded with ripe, fleshy cherry fruit and suggestions of steely minerality, typical of the terroir. Big, full, delicious and nicely balanced, it wraps up with a yummy chocolaty finish."
Pinot Noir,"This small producer continues to impress with this floral, impressively made effort, sourced from several vineyards, including Terra de Promissio. Sly layers of raspberry define juicy acidity and sizable tannin and oak that support but don't intrude. The finish continues the theme of vibrancy, lingering in cherry and dried cranberry."
Pinot Noir,"Located on a high slope in Marsannay, the Vaudenelles Vineyard creates structured wines. This selection has a beautiful perfumed character, and it offers delicious red-berry flavors and lively acids that are striated by minerality."
Pinot Noir,"Herbal and toasty, this is a smooth, open and forward Pinot. It is showing plenty of barrel influence at the moment, but the fruit seems to thin out a bit in the finish. As it's young, it could certainly flesh out and balance itself with a bit more bottle age."
Pinot Noir,"Richly expressed black plum and strawberry notes mesh with Red Hot candies, purple flowers and potpourri aromas, along with flashes of rosemary and pine. The palate is perfumed with touches of lavender, anise, dried black sage and mint, laid across alpine strawberries, black cherry and raspberry fruit."
Pinot Noir,"The Attaché brings appealing and lively cherry fruit, framed with citrusy acidity. The power in this wine is all forward and fruit-driven. It's quite good, but more for immediate drinking than cellaring."
Pinot Noir,"This Pinot Noir opens with a soft intensity of raspberry liqueur and cherry tart with a sprinkling of orange peel. Unfined and unfiltered, it's subdued and structured, an intriguing example of the dual power and finesse behind Morning Dew Ranch, Burt Williams's vineyard in Philo."
Pinot Noir,"This is a huge wine that's dense in flavors, rich in tannins, and with the soft lusciousness associated with this vineyard. Made from old vines, it's bold in cherry pie, red currants and mocha, yet dry and resilient on the finish. Delicious as it is now, it's a wine with a successful history for aging. Resist the temptation to drink it now and cellar. Best from 2017 and beyond."
Pinot Noir,"Is it just a simple, delicious drink-me-now Pinot? Or is it actually complex and worthy of pairing with the best foods? It's both. Front-loaded with raspberry purée, smoked butter and oak flavors, it has subtle layers of mushroom and dried pine that lift it into an ethereal place. Who cares if it will age? It's drop-dead gorgeous now. Char-broiled salmon could be your best pairing."
Pinot Noir,"Just beautiful, this wine combines spicy, arresting aromas, vivid, bright cherry and raspberry flavors, an electric mouthfeel and bracing texture. All nerve and muscle, and no fat, it is vibrant in acidity, with firm tannins that support the enticing fruit flavors. Virtually irresistible now, this will gain complexity through at least 2022."
Pinot Noir,"Even Carrick's entry-level wine has turned out well in 2013, offering a sturdy, robust mouthful of dark fruit. Plum, espresso and dark chocolate mingle on the nose and palate, while the finish is long, faintly dusty and mouthwatering. Drink 2017–2025."
Pinot Noir,"Extended time in all new French oak barrels give this wine a heartier feel than it might otherwise have, swirls of oaky caramel and toast most prominent on the nose and initial palate. A richness of color also stands out, while velvety tannins and red fruit complete the experience. Letting the wine open helps temper its size, revealing a measured level of refinement."
Pinot Noir,"The cool weather of the Sonoma Coast has made for an acidic, somewhat minty wine. It has some good flavors of cherries, and is elegantly structured and bone dry, but may not have the stuffing for the cellar, so drink now."
Pinot Noir,"This AVA's typical minerality underscores this full-bodied wine, which bears flavors of spice, berry and black cherry cola."
Pinot Noir,"Ripe in dense black cherry, this wine has a pleasant juiciness that keeps it balanced in the glass. A firmness of acidity supports the well-integrated tannins and lithe fruit, while the finish brings a swirl of cinnamon-cola and vanilla."
Pinot Noir,"This has a warm and inviting cherry compote aroma. Broad, ripe and complex flavors resemble black cherry, cinnamon and wood smoke, with a full body and a velvety texture.The wine falls on the rich, plush side of the fence, simply gorgeous in flavor profile, full bodied and long on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Hawke's Bay isn't known for Pinot Noir, but this wine shows that it can be done, given proper site selection. It's supple in style and fully ripe, with an open-knit texture and velvety finish, yet boasts pretty cherry and floral notes. Drink now–2019."
Pinot Noir,"Tasted alongside the winery's light and elegant 2010 Pinots, this 2009 Reserve boldly stands out. The fleshy, black fruit flavors are bigger and fuller across the palate than those from the later vintage. The finish is streaked with a cola note and will leave you reaching for the bottle as soon as your glass is empty."
Pinot Noir,"Made from a selection of high-end vineyards otherwise sourced for single-vineyard wines, this is a stellar offering and a steal of a deal for the quality, a mix of funky, lightly spiced dark plum and black cherry that's unfussy in its approach. Mouthcoating, it'll please a wide range of palates and meals."
Pinot Noir,"The grapes to make this rich, ripe wine were sourced from vines that were planted in the 1980s. The vineyard, which is located next to Bonnes Mares, yields wines that have an open, generous style, plus elements of structure that lend aging potential. Ready to drink in two years, but it should age well for many more."
Pinot Noir,"It's like Christmas in a glass the way the aromas on this wine settle keenly on pine and sugar plum. Earthy with a touch of dried herb, the wine's mouthfeel is velvety with a kick, the body full-figured in blackberry intensity, with the whole wrapped in substantial oak. The weight and firmness suggest cellaring, through 2017."
Pinot Noir,"Tea, spice, tomato and dried-fruit aromas feed into a lightweight palate with slightly raw acidity. Snappy flavors of red currant and plum are clean, fresh and light. In a nutshell, that's what this Tupungato Pinot is about: freshness, femininity and dried red fruits. Drink through 2019."
Pinot Noir,"Borderline translucent in color, and equally light in the nose. The aromas are of cranberry and chlorine. The palate is all strawberry and some bitter oak, and while it picks up steam and fills out with time, the initial impression is hard to overcome."
Pinot Noir,"This wine's cranberry, raspberry and cherry flavors are spicy and tart, carrying a suggestion of hard candy. It's consistent throught its tart finish and promises much development ahead. Drink now through the late 2020s."
Pinot Noir,"Tight-grained tannin plays a supporting role to this wine's undeniable earthiness, a mix of compost and wild mushroom. Subtle on the nose, the savory character gives way eventually to a density and concentration of brighter flavors, from cherry and citrus to spiky pine."
Pinot Noir,"Adam Lee's take on this vineyard on the eastern border of the Sta. Rita Hills is rich with tomato, cinnamon, sour cherry and tart blackberry aromas. It's soft and velvety once sipped, with cranberry juice flavors and cola making for a fun yet approachable Pinot Noir, easy to drink but able to trigger deep thoughts as well."
Pinot Noir,"A soft and rounded wine, full of ripe fruits that command all the attention. Red fruits dominate, just supported by tannins and a firm dryness. This is a rich wine that will age quickly, worth drinking in the next two years."
Pinot Noir,"This wine seems to be a casualty of the cold vintage, with thin fruit and overall earthy flavors. A whiff of barnyard is evident as well."
Pinot Noir,"Fat red cherries and red plums are laid across slate and star anise on the nose of this bottling based on a historic clone. There is solid tension to the sip, with rocky, grippy minerality framing hibiscus, pomegranate and chaparral flavors."
Pinot Noir,"From an ocean-view vineyard with consistently exceptional fruit, this wine represents its provenance with class and elegance, delivering crisp cranberry and cherry around an ethereal earthiness and deft seasoning of herb. Aged in barrels previously used for Chardonnay from the same vineyard, it offers restrained oak that still provides structure."
Pinot Noir,"A bold, chewy expression of the variety, Summit exhibits its 15% whole-cluster fermentation. It also is given more oak, a chance to tame its wild black cherry and lush cola spice. Black tea and a trace of red fruit play into the personality of the wine, adding a brightness to what is otherwise a decadent, full-throttle wine, barely tamed at that. Drink now through 2023."
Pinot Noir,"The chilly vintage shows in the light delicacy of this Pinot Noir. It's pale in color and quite tart in the mouth, which gives the cherries, cranberries and cola a bite. There's a rich jacket of oak, while the official alcohol level is 14.2% by volume. Drink now–2016."
Pinot Noir,"Light cranberry aromas meet turned loam, cinnamon and porcini mushroom-like umami touches in this bottling from a famed vineyard in the region. The mouthfeel is full and broad, but it's also lively with tart cranberry and raspberry fruit, earthy spice and a touch of raw beef rusticity"
Pinot Noir,"From four acclaimed Mendocino County vineyards, Winemaker Jon Grant's Straight Line Pinot is heftier than his single-vineyard bottlings from sister label Couloir. A dense style of Pinot, this has smoke and oak to it, plenty of strawberry and plum, its tannins not resolved, yet it still exhibits a lush fullness and well-rounded elegance."
Pinot Noir,"Not quite ripe, with a vegetal, herbal edge to the cherry and raspberry fruit. The acidity is nice and brisk, and the texture is beautifully silky, but that tug of greenness distracts, and limits ageability."
Pinot Noir,"Extraordinarily rich, this Pinot Noir dazzles with extracted cherries and raspberries, with exotic mulberry additions that have a spicy, feral, meaty quality. Top Anderson Valley vineyards often show this wild note, so welcome in an era when ripe fruit is easy to achieve. On a par with MacPhail's great 2007 Frattey Shams bottling, and the good news for consumers is that they've lowered the price considerably. Drink now–2016."
Pinot Noir,"It was fascinating to compare this to Two Paddocks' regular bottling. The Last Chance is slightly richer, but otherwise features many of the same elements: smoke, tart cherries and delicate herbal notes. Despite the extra concentration, it's still supple and approachable now."
Pinot Noir,"A tart sour-cherry note is warmed by hints of sweet vanilla and freshly shaven cedar on this brisk, sprightly wine. Hints of wet leaves and brine add a tinge of savoriness to the palate."
Pinot Noir,"Attractive red fruits dominate this light and fruity wine. Good acidity and bright flavors are smoothed by wood, while the aftertaste brings back the fruit. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"There's no mistaking the variety, with aromas of sarsaparilla, underbrush and cherry, though a rubber-tire note provides some distraction. The cherry, strawberry and cranberry flavors show good concentration, though they seem a bit clunky at times."
Pinot Noir,"This generous wine is big and full on the nose, with two-thirds new French oak making itself felt in texture and aroma but entirely well-managed, resulting in a balanced wine. Forest floor and earth tones burst on the palate, followed by brambly dark berry fruit, the texture soft to the finish, which offers some grip."
Pinot Noir,"Here is a powerful young wine with concentrated plum and cherry fruit. It's beautifully built around perfectly ripened tannins that provide solid support without being intrusive. Compact and well proportioned, it lingers with highlights of espresso grounds, dark chocolate and black tea."
Pinot Noir,"This producer, based in Ladoix-Serrigny in the Côte de Beaune also has a small parcel in this Grand Cru in Vosne-Romanée. Like all this producer's wines it was fermented in open tanks before barrel aging. That gives an extra concentration to the ripe fruits and firm tannins. It is an opulent wine, juicy with black fruits and acidity. With its structure, it will certainly age further, so drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,"Elegant and complex, this conjures up scents and accents of breakfast tea, black cherry, cassis and cut tobacco. It's tart and sappy, with youthful verve and refreshing acidity. Drink now through 2025."
Pinot Noir,"This is a substantial, complete and well-balanced wine with a deep red color and brickish rim. Intensely fruity and spicy aromas incorporate elegant oak nuances, black cherries, nutmeg and cinnamon, leading to generous, ripe flavors and a smooth, velvety texture. It's quite complex and delicious."
Pinot Noir,"Light earth, tea and cherry aromas join tasty cranberry and raspberry flavors in this medium-bodied and well-balanced wine. It has a nice tension on the palate, with lightly gripping tannins and a firm, appetizing finish."
Pinot Noir,"This shows some extra concentration in its plum and cherry fruit. The mouthfeel has a pleasing texture, and the streaks of herb and cola are nicely integrated. As with many of the wines of this vintage, it's forward and fruit-driven and ready for immediate enjoyment."
Pinot Noir,"Creamy bubbles pour from the bottle on this reliably solid sparkler, with aromas of Meyer-lemon zest, gray slate, wet concrete, crushed white rocks and a shade of nectarine. The palate is yeasty with sourdough elements dominant, alongside shreds of red apple, lemon juice and tangerine rinds."
Pinot Noir,"This extremely limited selection is from the oldest section of the original estate vineyard, planted in 1972. Those old vine flavors are subtle and spicy, opening with pretty berries and breathing into subtle layers with just the right barrel touches of chocolate and espresso to smooth out the finish."
Pinot Noir,"This pretty Pinot offers ripe fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry. There's a nice dash of chocolate and a supple, seamless mouthfeel, with all the components beautifully integrated."
Pinot Noir,"Comes down on the brittle side, a dry, acidic Pinot Noir with good structure, but lacks the richness you really want. You'll find modest cherry, cola and vanilla flavors."
Pinot Noir,"Very fruity and rather soft in texture, this wine has a sense of sweetness from the buttery, grape aromas to the ripe, almost jammy flavors and gentle finish."
Pinot Noir,"A superb wine, the tannins carrying along the dense structure with ease and grace. The purity of the ripe berry fruit is very marked, with acidity giving freshness to the sweet wine. The whole ensemble is developing well, but will need many years' aging."
Pinot Noir,"Sour cherry and brown sugar aromatics introduce this wine, with comparable flavors that thin out rather quickly. Hints of clay and wet fur show as well. It's an unusual, but interesting, wine that may improve with more bottle age."
Pinot Noir,"A fine wine that shows the complexity and volume of the Santa Lucia Highlands. The wine is thoroughly dry and fairly full-bodied for a Pinot Noir, offering rich black cherry, currant and mineral flavors. Its depth and sturdy tannins suggest cellaring for 5–6 years."
Pinot Noir,"Lovely red berry fruits, with great acidity and fine perfumes. The elegance of the wine is spoilt slightly by a rustic edge, although the red berry aftertaste is fresh and clean."
Pinot Noir,"Elegant and well structured, this offers vibrant strawberry fruit wrapped around inviting aromatics of violet and spice. This cool-climate Pinot boasts a silky texture on the palate and finishes with subtle suggestions of wood smoke and cinnamon."
Pinot Noir,"A fascinating wine, it was processed in a carbonic fashion, in which the juice is allowed to ferment inside the mostly intact grape skins, much like what's done in Beaujolais. The result is a transparent, ruby red wine that offers scents of a dust storm mixed with crushed rock and chile pepper herbaciousness. It's warm and soft on the mouth with a presence that suggests something between peppercorns and bell peppers."
Pinot Noir,"It's refreshing to see another importer take a chance on Pinot Noir from the Adelaide Hills, a region that can reliably ripen the variety at reasonable crop loads. This is a rounder, more supple style of Pinot than most from Australia, with cola, spice and cherry notes reminiscent of Dr. Pepper, or of some Pinots from California's Russian River Valley. Drink now–2020."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is round, opulent and beautifully perfumed., with a structure smoothed by the ripe fruits and generous texture. Acidity and a fresh aftertaste bring out cherry flavors and leave a bright aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,"Ripe, ruddy cassis and blackberry are threaded with woody tones of briar and tobacco in this lush Pinot Noir. It's rich and silky on the palate, but marked by pert acidity and a long, velveteen finish."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is densely packed in ripe red-fruit aromas and flavors, but still expressive in earthy notes of cocoa nib, anise and black tea. Medium tannins and plush berry flavors flesh out the mouthfeel, with a crushed satin texture. The evolving finish seamlessly transitions between ripe, fleshy fruit flavors to cherry skin and finally lightly charred oak and woody spice. Drink now–2018."
Pinot Noir,"Initially round, this develops a strong minerality, with a texture that is firm and dominating ripe fruit. There is definite austerity here. The wine is at present firm and tough, and needs several years to open up."
Pinot Noir,"Moderately herbal and tannic, with tight cranberry and pomegranate fruit tucked inside the leaf and stem flavors. That said, this perfectly captures the terroir of the Eola-Amity Hills AVA. If there is a classic Oregon style of Pinot, this would be it."
Pinot Noir,"This is strongly marked by new oak on the nose at this stage, suggesting toast, brown sugar and coffee, but fruit comes through on the palate where hints of dark berries, cola, clove and cinnamon mingle. The wine is creamy and lush in texture, with ample weight and a lingering finish of dried fruit, vanilla and mocha. Drink from 2018 to 2025."
Pinot Noir,"This is a sound Pinot Noir, well-made and clean, with some complexity. It's your basic Russian River Valley, dry and crisp in acidity, with pleasant cola, red currant, cranberry and pomegranate flavors. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink up."
Pinot Noir,"A bit reduced when first opened, it throws off scents of burnt rubber, then slowly opens into a roundly fruity, lightly toasty Pinot with a firmly tannic base. Flavors of Dr. Pepper drift through the midpalate. Give it a good decanting and it's fine for near-term consumption."
Pinot Noir,"Spicy new-oak flavors dominate the modest fruit notes in this over-worked wine, knocking it off balance."
Pinot Noir,"Very fresh, very raspberry, this wine opens gently with sweetness and roundness. The tannins do come into play, but ever so gently, a counterpoint to the sweet, fine fruits that dominate this attractive, relatively early drinking wine."
Pinot Noir,"A strong smoky aroma, spicy oak flavors and a blast of ripe fruit make this a boisterous wine. It's full bodied, with heat on the palate. A little berry and cherry concentration comes through on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Firmly tannic, with a peppery flavor, this accents its tart berry fruit with flavors of brown spices and hints of dried leaves. Its power lies in the interplay of such details, as well as the overall balance and precision of the winemaking."
Pinot Noir,"Smoky and seductive in black cherry and a healthy dose of Asian spice, this wine is full-bodied and well concentrated in a thicket of blueberry and gamy meat."
Pinot Noir,"This is an everyday Pinot, with some classy features. It's silky and elegant in the mouth, with good acidity. The raspberry and cherry flavors are one-dimensional and sweet."
Pinot Noir,"This is solidly anchored in its ripe cherry fruit, a rich mouthful that represents the best of the winery's 2012 lineup of reserve bottlings. Highlights of citrus fruits elevate the acids, and there is a pleasing hint of toast across the full midpalate."
Pinot Noir,"Bright in color and full of snappy cherries on the nose. This cherry-dominated profile follows suit on the palate, where the fruit-to-wood-balance swings in favor of the crisp, dry fruit. Charged-up acids provide a jolt, as do the full tannins. It seems to have the right structure to age for a few years."
Pinot Noir,"Extraordinarily sweet and attractive in raspberry and cherry fruit, as concentrated and pure as anything in California. The acidity is beautiful, as you'd expect from this vineyard in such a cool vintage, and it showcases Pinot Noir's silkiness and beauty. Despite the immediate flash,  it will develop bottle complexity; hold until 2016."
Pinot Noir,"Intense and concentrated, this shows dense tannins and layers of red- and black-fruit flavors, with the acidity cutting through. It's likely to age well over 4–5 years."
Pinot Noir,"This wine offers astounding quality for the price, a juicy expression of fruit and spice with a depth of firm resolved tannin, lively acidity and layers of black cherry and cola. Approachable and delicious, it hits the mark on every level being light bodied and refreshingly balanced while complex."
Pinot Noir,"Thin, dry and harsh, with cola flavors that are so thin, all you can really detect is the heat of alcohol. If you're not fussy, it's a basic introduction to Pinot Noir."
Pinot Noir,"Shows lots of class and finesse for a Sonoma Coast Pinot that's under $20. It's fully dry and zesty in acidity, with rich tannins framing cherry, pomegranate, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors. A great starter Pinot if you're just getting into the variety. Production was 3,576 cases."
Pinot Noir,"This young wine remains tight and tannic, with light cherry fruit highlighted with fresh orange. The tannins are stiff and carry a hint of earthiness."
Pinot Noir,"With some tannins and with bright red fruits, this wine is structured and has attractive acidity. A perfumed wine with a fruity future, it will be ready to drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"Dark boysenberry, dried purple flowers, wet slate and a touch of bay leaf show on the nose of this thick and earthy bottling by the tech moguls T.J. and Valeta Rodgers. The mouthfeel is very chalky, and there is the winery's characteristic earthiness along with mocha and baking spice. But there are also brighter berry flavors, perhaps due to the sunnier slopes."
Pinot Noir,"Ripe, succulent flavors of cherries and cola mark this Pinot, along with earthier complexities of grilled mushrooms. Oak adds a sweet layer of toast, yet the wine remains satisfyingly dry. It's so delicious now, you can hardly keep from drinking it, but it will reward a year or two in the cellar."
Pinot Noir,"Light in color and rustically earthy on the nose, this wine offers ripe black cherry and licorice, with a touch of tartness on the finish. It takes on weight and body as it goes, peaking as the wine hits the back of the tongue."
Pinot Noir,"A light style, but still stylish, with finesse and good structure. The pretty plum fruit is lightly dusted with cocoa, softening the tannins and adding spice to the finish. A gentle and beguiling wine, ready for near-term enjoyment."
Pinot Noir,"This is a forceful and powerful wine from a vineyard site in the producer's portfolio since 2005. Broad-shouldered, it offers juicy strawberry and pomegranate expressive of a ripe, picture-perfect vintage. It also manages to retain a pretty, floral characteristic and a depth of dried herb, clove and peppery spice, particularly on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"This wine has gorgeous ripe fruit aromas, mouth-filling flavors and a plush, generous texture. A hint of smoke shades the ripe black-cherry aromas. Layered flavors of clove, cedar, pomegranate and rosemary intermingle on the palate. Despite the ripeness and full body, a fine coat of tannins and supportive acidity keep the mouthfeel fresh and appetizing."
Pinot Noir,"Bryan Babcock sources from the Buona Terra Vineyard for this bottling that shows intensely focused aromas of candied pomegranate, cola, anise seed and dew on sweet sagebrush. It's rich and soft on the palate, yet lively with intense herbal energy and grippy tension, all laid across the juice of ripe red berries."
Pinot Noir,"Skiers will appreciate the nom de vin, a reference to the steepness of the vineyard. Firm and concentrated, this mixes ripe cherries and red plums, baking spices and a streak of minerality. It's a big, chunky, flavorful wine that rides on through a luscious finish."
Pinot Noir,"This is a rich, plump young Pinot Noir. It's medium-bodied and velvety, with plum, black cherry, bacon and Indian spice flavors, and with a lovely coat of sweet, smoky sandalwood. The tannin-acid balance suggests 5–7 years in the cellar, although it's fine now with a decant."
Pinot Noir,"Sagebrush aromas lead off this bottling from the newish Fossil Point label, which is connected to the higher end Center of Effort brand. On the palate, spice, tar and pomegranate accompany some fairly weighty tannins, meaning that this will probably emerge as a better wine by 2016."
Pinot Noir,"A little sharp and raw in mouthfeel, but silky, elegant and dry. Shows cherry pie filling, orange tea, mocha, cola and mint flavors. Ready now."
Pinot Noir,"Meant to provide value, this wine also offers big oak, smoke and a bittersweet taste of black-tea tannins. Shy in fruit, this has a slightly reduced effect on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"This accessibly priced wine shows soy, black tea, boysenberry, black pepper, baked plums and lavender notes on the nose. The palate offers lilacs, rose petals and more lavender, alongside olallieberry, pencil lead and a peppery spice."
Pinot Noir,"This is a very perfumed wine, full of red fruits and hedgerow berry flavors cut with some firm tannins. It has an aromatic character that is typical of Chambolle-Musigny, a soft, warm texture that is developing behind the tannins. It needs to age, so drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"Dry, spicy and showing aromas of cherry and herbs that are true to the grape. Medium bodied, with light cherry, raspberry and peppery flavors, and the finish is toasty and oaky, with cocoa. A touch herbal and strained but for the most part it's true, likable Pinot Noir."
Pinot Noir,"This Pinot is a full, fragrant, fetching wine with spongy citrus and cherry fruit, underscored with leesy minerality. It's ready for immediate enjoyment, and should be consumed now through 2020."
Pinot Noir,"The red berry and pomegranate fruit flavors are set against a background of dry earth, dried leaf and stem. It's balanced and detailed, definitely tilted more toward the herbal side of Oregon Pinot Noir rather than a fruitier style."
Pinot Noir,"Here, Pinot Noir master Richard Longoria offers a more affordable taste of his Fe Ciega estate vineyard (whose other expressions cost upwards of $45 each). Aromas range from cranberry and tart blackberry to black pepper and wet slate, and the flavors hone in on sour cherry and tar. This wine features gripping tannins, so wait until 2016 for an even more optimal experience."
Pinot Noir,"Ripe and round, this has a strawberry flavor that is surrounded by dense tannins. It shows a fine line of fresh acidity, and it is ready to drink, although it will age for several years."
Pinot Noir,"This Sonoma Coast Pinot is dry and simple, with raspberry, strawberry and oak flavors, accented with mouthwatering acidity. A bit of oak adds smoky complexity."
Pinot Noir,"Good price for a Pinot Noir this elegant and delicious. It's dry and firm, with zesty acidity and some furry tannins. Flavors of raspberries, cola and buttered cinnamon toast lead to a long, spicy finish. Decant it an hour or two before drinking."
Pinot Noir,"This fruity wine brings a mix of strawberry and watermelon, in a smooth and simple format. There's a suggestion of some over-ripe fruit in the mix, so best to drink this chilled down."
Pinot Noir,"This nonvintage wine comes packaged in 187ml cans (four to a pack)—each good for one generous glass pour. Pleasant cherry flavors carry it through, and it's a fine porch pounder, or safe on a hike or campout (just pack the cans back out). Maybe the packaging puts the thought of metal in a taster's head, but there seems to be a slightly tinny aftertaste."
Pinot Noir,"This is unusually pale, with a suggestion of a tawny, slightly oxidized hue. The soft entry brings dusty spices and tart cherry fruit. It finishes with some darker, slightly charred tones, and a hint of cigar. Drink up."
Pinot Noir,"For an inexpensive Oregon Pinot Noir, this has a lovely, expansive aroma that mingles rose petals, strawberry, white chocolate and cola. This is elegant, supple and entirely approachable, with none of the hard, earthy, vegetal or bitter character that can often characterize inexpensive Pinots. Think of a really good village Burgundy from a ripe vintage such as 2005, but at a much better price."
Pinot Noir,Thick tannins gird the powerful fruit in this wine—a mix of red cherry and strawberry that mellows with time in the glass. Toasted oak and baking spice touches provide additional context and pleasure.
Pinot Noir,"A spicy wine, silky and light-bodied, with sour raspberry candy, mushroom and sandalwood flavors leading to a long, complex finish. It's an elegant, polished wine, with modest alcohol . Seems best for drinking over the next few years."
Pinot Noir,"With a delicate, silky mouthfeel and bright acidity, this wine fulfils Pinot's basic requirements. It has raspberry, persimmon and mushroom flavors, and also is quite tannic. Drink now, after decanting it for a while."
Pinot Noir,"An inviting mix of rose and nutmeg evolves into tightly woven layers of raspberry and blueberry, with the wine deftly showing its youth and fine-vintage pedigree. Powerful on the palate, it has weight and length, followed by softly lingering allspice."
Pinot Noir,"Crushed cloves, allspice and nutmeg are sprinkled across a ripe olallieberry base on this wine from a vineyard owned by the founder of Rabbit Ridge. It's thick and dense on the palate, perhaps too much so for some, with dried cherries, cranberries, lots of spice and even some tar elements."
Pinot Noir,"Expensive, but a perfect Pinot Noir to drink now for sheer luxury and decadence. Tastes so good, offering a tapestry of raspberry, cherry, licorice, mocha and sweet, smoky sandalwood. With finely ground tannins and near-perfect coastal acidity, it's addictively likeable. Now–2012."
Pinot Noir,"A slightly reduced aroma unfurls from the glass, begging for more time to air before unfolding with structured layers of olive, sage and pomegranate. The acid-driven structure is noticeably lean and layered."
Pinot Noir,"While it is not a premier cru, this wine conveys many of the precise red-fruit flavors of the Les Marconnets vineyard just below on the slope. It is finely perfumed, with the softness typical of the northern Beaune vineyards. Vivid strawberry and red-cherry fruits are already delicious and ready to drink."
Pinot Noir,"Made with a minimal-intervention mind-set, this marries classic French winemaking to tight, almost steely Willamette Valley fruit. It's a taut, tense wine, focused on raspberry/cherry fruit, with firm, chocolate-tinged tannins. Highlights of malted milk and tobacco sneak into the extended finish."
Pinot Noir,A seven-acre vineyard on the eastern side of Mercurey gives a wine that is broad and ripe. Both its structure and its juicy red fruits are generous and with a firm core of tannins. The wine is likely to age well. Drink from 2022.
Pinot Noir,"Ripe and fruity in raspberries and cherries, this Pinot is also sweet in toasty oak. It has a nice, pleasantly silky texture. Not going anywhere, but good for drinking now."
Pinot Noir,"This intensely crisp selection shows its red-currant-driven acidity immediately. It is a fragrant, refreshing wine, very food-oriented with its dry character. It has touch of toast and a taut, minerally finish."
Pinot Noir,"Armanino's 2010 shows a welcome return to form after the 2009. Indeed, it's more like the '08, vastly rich in raspberry and cherry compote, gingersnap cookie, sweet, caramelized oak and exotic spice flavors. Feels like pure silk and satin in the mouth, making it perfect for drinking now."
Pinot Noir,"From a great site in this cool appellation, this wine shines with a powerful grip of ripe cherry and strawberry fruit and earthy undertones of dried herb and cardamom cola. Layered and dense, it has a seductively smooth texture and bite of minerality."
Pinot Noir,"This wood-aged and structured wine is concentrated and dense. It comes from the Premier Cru vineyard just to the west of the village. With generous tannins and juicy ripe red fruits, the wine is broad and going to be rich. Drink from 2023."
Pinot Noir,"For a cool-climate Pinot Noir, this is ripe, rich and round. Its ample weight delivers broad, complex flavors of clove, cinnamon, black cherry, plum and cola, but its oaky overcoat may dissuade purists. Although the fruit comes from Tasmania, the wine was made on the mainland at Giant Steps in the Yarra Valley. Drink now–2023."
Pinot Noir,"This wine opens with a touch of reductive qualities on the nose, allowing the oak to speak loudest. Soon, dark berry and cherry make their presence better felt, with the oak taking a lesser role and the soft, integrated tannins coating the palate in this light-bodied, unfussy effort."
Pinot Noir,"This is quite pretty, with a soft initial entry into strawberry fruit. There's a touch of resin, a whisper of chocolate, and overall a delicate sensibility, that gains strength and length with ample aeration. It exits smoothly with a finishing lick of caramel."
Pinot Noir,"A basket of tart red cherries, chipped asphalt, fresh-picked thyme and even a touch of rosemary show on the nose of this bottling by Josh Klapper from Riverbench Vineyard. Warmer flavors of cranberry, bay leaf and more thyme make the mouth water, boosted by a plum-skin-flavored acidity."
Pinot Noir,"Ready for immediate enjoyment, this offers a lifted nose of rose petals and cherry blossoms, carrying a slight whiff of milk chocolate. The fruit has a tart, cranberry character, moving up into Bing cherry flavors with plenty of crisp acidity."
Pinot Noir,"A gorgeously plush Pinot, redolent of bright cherry, strawberry, plum, cinnamon and herbs. Explosively fragrant, it's rich and lively on the palate, where it finishes long and lush. A real winner from this Central Coast specialist in Pinot Noir."
Pinot Noir,"On the rustic side, this fruity wine has rhubarb and red fruit flavors, with intense acidity and a pure, juicy core. The soft tannins just underpin the fruity character. Age for two years, although it's ready to drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Succulent and complex, this wine offers substantial body and lush plushness on the palate, alluring in its layering of cardamom spice and orange, cranberry and cherry. Satisfyingly ripe, with inimitable balance, it shows the elegance possible in spite of the appellation's power."
Pinot Noir,"Spicy, fruity and fresh, this hearty vineyard-designate is high-toned in red cherry and citrus, well-integrated and softly layered, with a blistering note of tannic power on the finish. Drink now through 2020."
Pinot Noir,"Dilute yet raisiny aromas struggle to stir interest. This wine feels wide and flat on the palate, with no real focal point. Chunky, slightly bitter flavors of apple skins and wood spice finish with a blast of oaky clove."
Pinot Noir,"This shows both the finesse of the Anderson Valley and the '09 vintage that was so kind to coastal Pinot Noir. It has rich flavors of cherry jam and ripe pomegranate, with fine acidity, but there's an excessive oakiness that gives it a toothpicky sweetness."
Pinot Noir,"This shows light, tangy cranberry and raspberry flavors on the fresh, straightforward attack. Beyond that, it doesn't offer much detail, finishing with a touch of acidity."
Pinot Noir,"Dry smelling, like a wild field in summer, meaning it's a bit brambly. Feels thorough and full, with tea, spice and oaky flavors supporting sweet berry fruit. Crusty and toasted on the finish, but clean and solid as a whole."
Pinot Noir,"Ripe and full-bodied, this is a bright and velvety wine, driven aromatically by lush cherry, cola and vanilla. Textured and fleshy, it's a strong statement for the vintage and vineyard. Deliciously drinkable now, it should also do well in the cellar, through 2020."
Pinot Noir,"Could use greater acidity and structure to provide a framework for all the fruit, but that fruit sure is attractive. It floods the mouth with raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with pretty additions from smoky oak. Not going anywhere, so drink up."
Pinot Noir,"Dark color and a punch of smoky oak underline this wine's big burly hold of tannin and ripe fruit. Tobacco, tar and baked cherry highlight the flavor wheel."
Pinot Noir,"Veteran winemaker Nick Goldschmidt has crafted a simple, appealing Marlborough Pinot Noir featuring bright cranberry and pie-cherry fruit, some slightly mossy or herbal elements, medium body and supple tannins. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Tense with acidity and dense in firm tannins, this fun, affordable wine needs time to unwind after opening. Once aired, it shares notes of black tea, licorice and a twine of leather around thick, shy fruit, most notably cranberry."
Pinot Noir,"The Vigne de l'Enfant Jésus is a 10-acre parcel in the heart of the Grèves vineyard that once belonged to Carmelite nuns. This vintage, while marked by acidity and soft fruit, does have a firm edge of dark tannins, filled out with plum and red cherry flavors."
Pinot Noir,"This is a finesse wine, with light flavors of pomegranate and cranberry. There's a suggestion of burnt toast—just a hint—around the tannins, which remain a bit stiff and chewy. Give this another year or two and it should open up further."
Pinot Noir,"Big, rich while also smooth, this is going to be a impressive wine. It has power and firm tannins as well as plenty of ripe black fruits and acidity. This wine, from one of the range of grand crus in Vosne-Romanée, will age well. Drink from 2026."
Pinot Noir,"A simple Pinot Noir, dry and light-bodied and elegant, with red cherry, root beer, mint, pepper and vanilla flavors. Shows the variety's personality in a direct, likeable way."
Pinot Noir,"From the home village of Pierre André's Château Corton-André, this is a solid, chunky wine, its tannins very prevalent at this stage. It promises to be a smoother, wood-aged sip with blackberry and spice as well as a tasty juiciness."
Pinot Noir,"While lithe on the nose, with understated red-fruit aromas, this shows a palate that's nicely concentrated with crisp red-cherry and plum flavors, laced with an invigorating shower of minerality and acidity."
Pinot Noir,"This is bone dry, with lots of zesty acidity and flavors of sour cherry candy, pomegranate and persimmon, with a mushroomy earthiness. It should change over the next four years, although not necessarily improving. Try pairing it with steak, lamb or a rich cut of ahi tuna."
Pinot Noir,"A beautiful Pinot that shows its coastal influence in the balance of ripe, long hangtime fruit and crisp acidity. Floods the mouth with cherry, cola, mocha, cinnamon toast, black pepper and vanilla flavors that are delicious. With its edge of tannins, it will hold for a few years of aging."
Pinot Noir,"This Pinot is on the thin side, rather stingy in fruit. But it's dry and crisp and clean enough to be called elegant. Shows modest cherryskin flavors that are generously spiced."
Pinot Noir,"This is raw, sour, tangy and loaded with juniper and pine notes."
Pinot Noir,"The Momtazi vineyard supplies these grapes. The wine has a sharp edge to it, a sense of raw wood that pushes against tart, stiff red fruits. Whiffs of smoke and salted chocolate add welcome nuances. The winery's AVA series provides interesting, nicely differentiated wines at somewhat moderate (for Oregon Pinot) prices."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is ripe, rich and full in the mouth, like a fruit salad of red cherries, plums and berries. Yet there's a more solid side—rounded tannins support the concentrated fruits, and touches of wood aging broaden the feel of this impressive wine. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,"The estate vineyard, planted between 1999 and 2005, includes several different blocks, named for family members. This Pinot has a pleasing softness, entering the mouth gently with light raspberry candy flavors. The fruit is wrapped in chocolaty oak."
Pinot Noir,"This wine shows a touch of spicy, smoky oak from aging in 20% new French barrels, setting off powerful fruity, earthy flavors that create a complex, layered and fascinating personality. It's full bodied, mouth-filling and moderately tannic."
Pinot Noir,"This is a fairly muscular, chunky Pinot Noir. Black cherries and plums power it, accented by slightly piny, herbal notes. It's neither silky nor particularly long on the finish, but is a satisfying, sturdy red to drink over the next few years."
Pinot Noir,"Dark, full, generous and ripe to the far edge of elegance, this powerful Pinot is saturated with black fruits, annotated with fennel, pepper, smoke and espresso, the rich and varied flavors rolling right through a lush midpalate and on into a gently fading finish. Retasted over 24–48 hours, it continued to evolve and develop additional nuances. A wine to cellar for a decade or more."
Pinot Noir,"At 21,000 cases, this might be the biggest production Pinot Noir in the county. This good, introductory-level Pinot has a silky mouthfeel and crisp, refined flavors of raspberry, cherry and beet. Don't look for complexity. Just enjoy."
Pinot Noir,"A huge wine, almost Rhône-like in its dark color, thick mouthfeel and cherry flavors. But those cherries are really exotic, suggesting liqueur, and pies spiced with cinnamon, anise, nutmeg and mocha, along with the smoky, buttery sweet pie crust. For all the immediate appeal, it has the tannins and acids to age for a good six years."
Pinot Noir,"This is Sojourn's most successful 2010 Pinot Noir, because it's the ripest and most satisfying. It shows rich, tantalizing raspberry, cherry and cola flavors that are brightened by brisk acidity. It earns extra points for its complexity."
Pinot Noir,"This entry-level Pinot from Domaine Serene outshines more than a few Oregon reserves. It's splendidly clear, refined and aromatic, with a tantalizingly smoky note in play. There is a pleasing dusty character to the cherry fruit and the finish is dappled with highlights of cinnamon toast. It's flat-out irresistible."
Pinot Noir,"Scents and flavors of beet root, rhubarb and cranberry are front and center in this stiff, tart wine with root and acidic flavors. It spent 22 months in one-third new French oak, but that doesn't register on the palate."
Pinot Noir,"This has a rather deep red color and a slightly smoky rim. It offers profuse aromas of black cherry and blackberry, medium to full body and a generous texture. It's enjoyable for the fruit flavor, and easy to drink due to the soft texture. The finish is lingering and almost sweet."
Pinot Noir,"Nicely textured strawberry fruit is featured here. It drinks almost like an especially rich rosé, fresh and simple, in a good way. There's a dash of bitter green in the finishing tannins."
Pinot Noir,"Black cherry, blueberry and blackberry combine for a rewardingly rich, ripe nose, layered with flecks of graphite and chai-like spice. The palate is driven at first by black soil elements, evolving into cooked cherries, tar and bitter root vegetables, yet possessing a strawberry lightness as well. This is extremely complex and as fresh as any more recent vintages."
Pinot Noir,"Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out."
Pinot Noir,"Spiced plum, dried raspberry and cherry-cough-drop aromas are attractive. This feels medium in body, with plumpness cut by fresh acidity. Flavors of dried cherry and baking spices finish solidly and smoothly."
Pinot Noir,"Structured and dense, with layered tannins and an austere edge. At the same time, the fruit packs concentrated strawberry flavors, acidity and complexities from textured wood."
Pinot Noir,"Cool weather in 2012 kept acid levels high, something that comes across clearly in this wine. The fruit is bright and crisp—more like pie cherry than Bing or Rainier—and turns tart on the finish. Because of this, it could be one of those Pinot Noirs that pairs well with salmon."
Pinot Noir,"The winery is in eastern Oregon, near the Idaho border, but the grapes were sourced from an unnamed Willamette Valley vineyard. It's a toasty wine, pleasing and easy-drinking, with pretty red cherry fruit. A dash of iron and some roasted coffee flavors add interest."
Pinot Noir,"Light, clear and crisp, this extremely light-bodied wine combines fruit from various vineyards and clones, and offers a suggestion of cranberry and pomegranate. Earthy, with an edge of forest and tea, it finishes plainly."
Pinot Noir,"A pure and distinctive fruit flavor, like a blend of rhubarb and blackberry, distinguishes this full-bodied but elegant and velvet-textured wine. There is little or no new oak influence to get in the way of the melody of the grapes themselves. While the wine is lush and broad in mouthfeel, a nice boost of fine tannins and fresh acidity keep it lively."
Pinot Noir,"For a Premier Cru, this is surprisingly open and ready. It has a light structure, offering delicious, forward, juicy fruit that has been rounded out by wood aging. With its ripe character, it will be ready to drink in a year."
Pinot Noir,"The second vintage of Rainstorm is smooth and pretty, showing flavors of ripe strawberry and chocolate that last through the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Right out of the bottle, this single vineyard Pinot is rich. The flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar, are delicious and direct. You can certainly drink it now, but the acid-tannin balance suggests the wine will develop and improve over the next 5–6 years."
Pinot Noir,"The 2008 Sineann Pinots are an elegant, refined group of wines, more expressive of Burgundian varietal character than any in memory, and the Resonance, as usual, is among the best. It has a vibrant purity to the fruit that rings true and long through mixed red berries, vivid acids, streaks of iron and earth, and sails on into a detailed and seamless finish."
Pinot Noir,"You'll want to age this Pinot for a few years. It's drily tannic and tart in acidity, which hides the polished black cherry, cola, beef jerky and spice flavors under an astringent coat. Try after 2011."
Pinot Noir,"Made from certified organic fruit, this impressively dark and tannic bottling is essentially the second wine of Huia. Dark cherries and vanilla finish firm. Drink it now with grilled meats, or hold it until 2018–2019 and see how it develops in the cellar."
Pinot Noir,"The new oak is dialed down a bit to 33% in this memorable red from the producer's estate Quail Hill Vineyard. Lovely in every way, it opens in rose petals and a subtlety of Asian five-spice, before a succulence of cranberry, rhubarb and orange unleash a fullness of fruit and lush texture on the palate."
Pinot Noir,"Stark minerality, from hot gravel to chipped slate, meets with garrigue elements of lavender and thyme on the nose of this strong bottling that gains a savory quality thanks to roasted-pork aromas. The requisite fruit arrives on the sip, where smashed cranberry meets with pepper spice and dried herbs. The structure is grippy and affords great length in the finish."
Pinot Noir,"It's rare to get a twenty buck Pinot Noir this good. The wine is dry, silky and elegant, almost faultless in its precision. With savory cherry, red licorice, cola and sandalwood flavors, it's not an ager, but a very pretty wine for drinking now."
Pinot Noir,"Blended from selected vineyards across the Sonoma Coast near Carneros, including the producer's own estate, this wine is made to be approachable and ready to go. It was aged in neutral oak casks, stainless steel and some larger neutral French oak. Herb and mint stand out against a backdrop of rustic black cherry."
Pinot Noir,"Sourced from grapes grown in the Côte Chalonnaise, this is a soft, red-fruit-flavored wine, with a ripe, jammy character that makes it almost sweet. It is ready to drink."
Pinot Noir,"This is dry, scratchy and peppery smelling, with a soft, plump mouthfeel, plus leafy, herbal flavors of baked berry and plum. Plump and solid in terms of feel, with modest fruit and carob flavors that control the short finish."
Pinot Noir,"This food-friendly Pinot Noir has a light body, dryness and crisp acidity that make it easy to pair with steaks, chops, salmon, mushroom risotto and similar fare. There's nothing shy, however, about the flavors, which brim with ripe raspberries, cherries and pomegranates, accented with toasty, spicy oak. Drink now–2017."
Pinot Noir,"Côte de Beaune is a small strip of land at the south end of the Beaune vineyards, not often seen as a stand-alone appellation. This gently structured wine is full of fresh fruits and attractive acidity. With its dry core, it could develop but is drinkable now."
Pinot Noir,"This brilliant wine is supremely focused from the aroma to the finish, like a laser beam of rich and concentrated Bing-cherry flavor. The purity of the fruit makes it delicious to taste, and to feel the burst of cherry spread from the bright aromas on to the palate and to linger on the finish. Drink after 2019 when it should broaden a bit."
Pinot Noir,"Velvety and thick, this wine is tannic, oaky and still tenacious about its youth. Spicy cardamom, violet and dried herb notes make it more earthy than fruit-driven, begging for complementary fare at the table. Raspberry, black cherry and blackberry flavors vie for attention."
Pinot Noir,"Earthy black tea and clove are the highlights in this medium-bodied, moderately oaked wine, a fruity undercurrent of black cherry and strawberry lifting the savory, sassy elements to a bright core."
Pinot Noir,"A simple Pinot Noir, this is dry and crisp in acidity, with cherry pie, mint and cola flavors."
Pinot Noir,"A brilliant wine, massively sculpted and monumental, that shows how great this vineyard is. The wine shows densely concentrated flavors of blackberries and licorice, with the loveliest accent of sweet worn leather and rhubarb, flourished with the dusty spices that always characterize a fine Santa Maria Pinot Noir. Best now–2013."
Pinot Noir,"Solid and earthy, this is a bold, blocky style, highlighted with ripe cherry fruit. Notes of dried leaf and forest floor lead into drying tannins."
Pinot Noir,"This medium-bodied wine has ripe plum and cherry-candy aromas. Equally fruity flavors are accented by some oak spice, with pretty good balance from mild tannins and acidity."
Pinot Noir,"A blend of three vineyards, located between Corralitos and the Summit area, this bottling conveys rusty, earthy cranberries, cherries and Earl Grey tea on the nose. The earthy character also shows on the sip, where animal hide, sour cranberry, red plum, rose petal and pine-forest flavors converge."
Pinot Noir,"This Pinot Noir offers plenty of varietal pleasure. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with cherry skin, red currant and cola flavors."
Pinot Noir,"Well balanced, lively and delicious, this medium-bodied wine pulls together spicy oak and raspberry aromas, compelling and bright fruit flavors and a lip-smacking texture due to fine-grained tannins and good acidity."
Pinot Noir,"Baked strawberry and a bittersweet note of cherry play off the palate around a medium-bodied frame of subtle tannin and oak. Dried cranberry comes in as a secondary detail, before the wine finishes in a blaze of leather and black tea."
Pinot Noir,"The chocolate and black-cherry jam flavors are a little too heavy and rich, lacking zest and complexity. But there's no denying this Pinot is delicious to drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Light in body and frankly a little skinny, this is nevertheless a pretty wine, its tannic structure of skillfully woven silk. Subtle cherry and sous bois notes aren't overly powerful, but persist nicely on the finish. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Very opulent, very rich, this is a complex, structured wine packed with fruit and brooding tannins. It is already rich, and will develop into a beautifully intense, concentrated and generous wine."
Pinot Noir,"The wine is pale in color and very light in body, neither of which is a bad thing. You want some delicacy in a Pinot Noir. The drawback is in a candied simplicity to the flavors, which are of Lifesaver cherries and raspberries."
Pinot Noir,"Dry and gritty with cherry and raspberry flavors that finish thin and peppery. Nothing particularly wrong, just a simple little Pinot Noir."
Pinot Noir,"With easily enjoyed flavors of cherries, raspberries and cola, and a nice coat of sweetly smoked sandalwood, this is a pleasant Pinot Noir to drink now. The light body, and some sharpness on the finish, argue against ageability."
Pinot Noir,"This monopole (single owner vineyard) has produced a wine of great depth and concentration, packed with black fruits, berries and a smoky wood character. It's an impressive wine, very rich and with sufficient layered acidity. Very ageworthy."
Pinot Noir,"Ripe raspberry, slight minerality, mossy earthiness and a minty lift kick off this offering. On the palate, expect sour cherry, mocha and a pleasing espresso finish bolstered by tingling acidity. Though 2010 was considered a less-than-optimal year, the vintage look like a shining star now that wines like this have had time to come into their own."
Pinot Noir,"This has a noticeable scent of tackroom leather that carries into the flavors, somewhat muting the black-cherry fruit. For such a young wine it is already on the way to drying out. Some interesting accents of pipe tobacco, smoke and coffee run through the finish. It's now at its best, so drink up."
Pinot Noir,"Powerful and dense, this shows structured, ripe and concentrated black plum and dark cherry flavors. It has dense, firm tannins, which look likely to dominate the wine for many years, leaving a strong, dry aftertaste."
Pinot Noir,"Herbal plum aromas are oaky and lactic on the nose. This Pinot is juicy on the palate, with cool-climate acidity. The flavor profile includes distant red fruit notes and a heavy topping of oak resin on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Earns its stripes for the sheer power of raspberry and cherry fruit that defines its California ripeness. Firm tannins and acidity fortunately provide balance, and the wine finishes dry. An opulent, extravagent Pinot Noir that will provide lusty drinking over the next six years."
Pinot Noir,"A little on the sharp, green and minty side, with tart acids framing cherry, black raspberry and smoky wood flavors. A good wine that could use more lushness and richness."
Pinot Noir,"Red cherry, ripe cranberry, clove, star anise, dried plum skins and slate converge on the fairly complex nose of this bottling, with a label that features a whimsical map of Santa Barbara County. Light cranberry fruit meets with bay leaf on the sip that offers decent grip."
Pinot Noir,"Stoller offers fine value across its entire portfolio. This is solidly crafted and estate-grown, from the heart of the Dundee Hills AVA. There's a gentle touch of new oak, among a flavorful mix of strawberries, cherries and oranges. The moderate alcohol signals a balanced wine with ample acidity. Drink now through 2022."
Pinot Noir,"From the cool-climate region of Elgon, the Cluver Pinot offers sweet berries and violet on the nose and an unfolding palate of red berry, coffee and chocolate. Restrained and ageable, the wine's acidity gives it food-oriented character; pair with game or wild fish."
Pinot Noir,"Another excellent vintage from Saffron Fields, under the guiding hand of veteran winemaker Tony Rynders. Buoyed by aging in 50% new French oak, it's got more flesh than most Pinots from this cool vintage, along with generous amounts of sweet spices and barrel toast. The red fruits and complementary acidity are also here in abundance."
Pinot Noir,"An earthy rendering of Pinot Noir, this features scents and flavors of clean humus, dead leaves, molasses and just a hint of plum. It's medium-bodied, and finishes well, marked by silky tannins and ample length."
Pinot Noir,"Cherry, raspberry, herb and tomato aromas correctly announce a tightly clamped palate. Herbal plum and raspberry flavors are maintained on a tight, unbreakable finish. This is staunch and tight, with more than enough herbal character."
Pinot Noir,"Produced from 65-year-old vines, this is a rich and perfumed wine from the estate of Nicolas Potel. It is structured, balancing the red fruits and acidity with a solid framework of tannins. Spice from the wood aging shows lightly, while the wine finishes with crisp red-currant acidity."
Pinot Noir,"Moderately intense on the nose with dominating earthy, forest floor notes backed by red plum guts and cherry along with a hint of vanilla ice cream with raspberry sauce swirled in. Dusty tannins flesh out the palate and the finish offers some mild black pepper spice."
Pinot Noir,"Great fruit concentration and grace make this wine a winner. It feels medium-bodied despite its high degree of ripeness, showing that balance is attainable with significant power. It has ripe, plummy aromas, fresh red cherry and cranberry flavors, supportive tannins and excellent acidity."
Pinot Noir,"This dry, 100% Pinot Noir Champagne has tense acidity as well as crisp apple- and citrus-driven acidity. With its taut mineral character, it needs at least a year to soften."
Pinot Noir,"Sharply herbal, this shows a bit of a green edge, which comes across as bitterness on the finish. The pale red-fruit flavors hint at thistle and bramble more than ripe berry, but the balance is there to carry the wine well with food."
Pinot Noir,"There's a savory, slightly demure quality to this elegant Pinot Noir. The palate is not deeply concentrated, but crisp black cherry and plum flavors are shaded by tones of granite and dried herbs. Persistent, fine-grained tannins mark a moderate finish."
Pinot Noir,"Approachable in its youthful vigor and wealth of fruit, this medium-bodied coastal wine offers a complement of spicy black licorice, cranberry and strawberry, finishing lean and focused."
Pinot Noir,"This is a pleasant bottle, with delicate fruit flavors that suggest watermelon and strawberry—nothing riper. There's a distinct impression of white balsamic vinegar, adding a high-toned lift that's just on the edge of too much, at least for some tasters."
Pinot Noir,"The spicy aromas resemble black pepper and anise. Fruit flavors are ripe and delicious, and the creamy texture seems to melt in the mouth. This wine offers lots of personality and very good balance."
Pinot Noir,"Reustle's Reserve Pinot Noir is sweetly scented with cherry fruit. It opens into a lightly herbal wine with streaks of clean earth, graphite and smoke to complement the cherries."
Pinot Noir,"Sourced from old-vine Wädenswil clones, this effort carries the new Elkton AVA designation. Pretty raspberry and strawberry fruit is set in lightly toasty tannins. This is a lovely everyday Pinot Noir with some density."
Pinot Noir,"Cranberry, sour cherry, turned earth, dewy chaparral and anise aromas arise on this bottling from the historic Monterey producer. The mouthfeel is quite full, with sour cherries, leather, tobacco and mocha flavors cut by a judicious amount of acidity."
Pinot Noir,"There's a feral quality to this single-vineyard bottling, with dried rose petals, damp pine needles, dehydrated shiitake mushrooms and touches of violet, potpourri and dried ginger on the nose. The mouthfeel is velvety, with lilac and lavender decorating a base of cranberry and boysenberry fruit."
Pinot Noir,"Chorey-lès-Beaune, on the plain just north of Beaune, can offer—as here—good value for Burgundy. This wine, still showing some young austerity, has the potential to develop into a bold, fruity selection that will always have a firmer structured edge."
Pinot Noir,"This savory Pinot Noir features aromas of blistered tomatoes, Italian herbs, Dr. Pepper and strawberries stewed with anise. Oregano and rosemary give herbal backbone to the pomegranate fruit flavors, all culminating in a very sanguine finish."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is bold and full bodied, big enough for a grilled steak, with powerful ripe fruit flavors like black cherry and blackberry. Firm-enough tannins add grip to the texture, with slightly smoky, peppery accents on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Herbal raspberry and tomato aromas are edgy and come with a note of oak-based sweet plastic. A saucy-feeling palate is moderately intense, while flavors of tomato, plum and green herbs finish short, with a salty aftertaste."
Pinot Noir,"A wine that reflects the relative lightness of the reds in this vintage. It has a layer of tannins, but they don't suggest aging; they are more a base for the attractive raspberry and red plum flavor, freshened by the acidity."
Pinot Noir,"Using grapes sourced from four high-quality vineyards, this shows deeply layered raspberry, cherry, cola and mushroom flavors, with no trace of the unripeness that marred some other coastal wines from this cool vintage. Drink it over the next six years before the fruit fades."
Pinot Noir,"A big Pinot Noir, rich and extracted, and lacking delicacy at this time. It's as full-bodied as a Rhône blend, with jammy cherry, blueberry and spice flavors, enriched by lots of sweet new oak. Delicious, yes, if you care to drink it now. Try cellaring for four or five years to see if it mellows."
Pinot Noir,"Cherry cola accents this bright pretty wine. Fruit flavors emphasize fresh raspberries, backed with tangy acidity and modest tannins. Drink now through 2022."
Pinot Noir,"Simultaneously light yet earthy, this shows cherry pie, concentrated pomegranate, whole nutmeg, buttery crust and intriguing brown spices on the nose. There is a bit less action on the palate, but still plenty of tart cherries, tobacco and brown spice elements."
Pinot Noir,"From a winery named after a summit train stop between Los Gatos and Santa Cruz comes aromas of red cherry, rhubarb and clove spice. Flavors of vanilla cookies, dried strawberries, black cherries and a spicy dollop of licorice power the tasty palate."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is made from estate-grown grapes and a selection of clones, offering robust dark cherry and berry fruit spiked with cardamom, cola and black tea. Smooth and silky on the palate, it finishes with a trace of tart pomegranate and smoke."
Pinot Noir,"There's an overall dustiness to this wine, almost like a combination of talcum powder and dried, crushed plums and berries. Lean and slightly tart on the palate, it has a taut structure and a clean but short finish. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"There's a wild array of aromas to this appellation blend, including wild mint and huckleberries. It's bright red fruit at first sip, then the wine downshifts into cloves, wet asphalt and anise. A direct but clean and very appealing selection, ready for enjoyment now."
Pinot Noir,"Deep red plum, dried rose, lavender and oak smoke show on the nose of this bottling from Rick Longoria's estate vineyard, while it also offers a sanguine, feral quality. The palate continues the intrigue, its dried seaweed and wild sagebrush notes giving nuance to the tart strawberry and cranberry fruit."
Pinot Noir,"There's intensely sharp fruit character on the nose of this bottling from a single clone and block in this historic vineyard, with candied raspberry and pomegranate aromas that are leveled by Early Grey tea and pressed purple flowers. The palate is extremely lively and tightly structured, with dark boysenberry and candied raspberry flavors that rise into a minty finish."
Pinot Noir,"This wine has equal amounts of ripe berry fruit and structure. There is a smoky character, wood and spice notes, balanced acidity and a leather-like touch to the texture. It is slowly developing, and it has the potential to be rich. Age this for 6–8 years."
Pinot Noir,"Great now with lamb, this Pinot is softly complex and forward in fruit, with a silky texture. It shows cherry, raspberry, mocha, anise and smoky oak flavors. Best now and for a few more years."
Pinot Noir,"Crisp and tightly wound, this Baden Pinot has lovely cherry pie and vanilla scents folding in to leather and mixed berry flavors on the palate. Long, slightly tart finish of saddle leather. Drink now to 2013."
Pinot Noir,"A mix of clones and vineyard sources, this is a bit rough and tumble, as the name might suggest. Hard cherry candy carries a touch of rubber, and some rugged tannins. That said, it's got plenty of punch and power."
Pinot Noir,"This is a sophisticated blend of Pinot Noir grape flavors complemented by oak spice and a smooth, luxurious texture. Though full-bodied, the wine seems to glide effortlessly from cinnamon and cherry aromas through clove, cardamom and cassis flavors to an extended, hauntingly delicious finish. Best after 2018."
Pinot Noir,"Somewhat lean in texture but very tasty and classic in terms of aroma and flavor, this wine has a unique presence. Aromas suggest rhubarb, raspberry and black tea, and the flavors reflect that complexity, too. At less than half the price of Hirsch's higher-priced wines, it has almost as much charm."
Pinot Noir,"This is a clear, light wine, aged lightly in oak, only 30% of it new. Wild brush and burnt orange dominate in taste and aroma, with additional characteristics of rhubarb, red cherry and lovely rose."
Pinot Noir,"This light-bodied, surprisingly affordable wine surprises in its lightness of color and texture, its character driven by high-strung elements of pomegranate and tangerine. On the more savory side, expect nuances of earthy mint, bay leaf and white pepper."
Pinot Noir,"A little smokier in flavor and a little firmer in mouthfeel than other comparable wines, this has an intriguing angular personality that's intended not for cocktail hour but for pairing with, say, a roast pheasant. It has tart-cherry and berry flavors, some light peppery, woodsy accents and lusty, gripping tannins. Best after 2019."
Pinot Noir,"Domaine de l'Arlot owns just over one acre of this grand cru vineyard in Vosne-Romanée. This 2005 shows intense, complex fruits and tannins, both finely intertwined. There is power, but the strawberry flavors are just as important, flattering the palate."
Pinot Noir,"Sourced from select barrels drawn from five estate vineyards, the reserve spent 10 months in oak. It is only made in exceptional years, and 2012 was certainly among the best in memory. Berry, cherry and toast components are here in full measure, with a sumptuous mocha-infused finish. Still young, this wine will show best with aeration, or tuck it away for some extra bottle age."
Pinot Noir,"Moss and wood notes mingle with violet and lavender perfume on this elegant, subtly nuanced Pinot Noir. Ripe, rich black-cherry and berry flavors are offset by a brisk acidity and a penetrating mineral backbone. It's lovely now, but structured enough, and still boldly tannic, to merit further cellar aging. Drink from 2020–2025."
Pinot Noir,"Ripe, generous, powerful and opulent, the wine combines blackberry juice character with mature spice and mushroom flavors. This is a massive wine, with a gorgeous velvet texture, only a taut core of tannins. Despite moving towards a mature phase, it has many years ahead."
Pinot Noir,"Delicious aromas cover the entire range of the strawberry experience, from the scents of a blossoming strawberry field to frozen berries macerated into a syrup. It's refreshing and yet grippy on the palate at the same time, with candied raspberry and crushed vanilla bean swirling with bergamot rind, anise, black pepper and pine sap. Imagine mint-wrapped berries on a fresh-cut plank of oak."
Pinot Noir,"From an organic, dry farmed vineyard, this wine is as feral as the forest—a study in wild boar, wildflowers and dried herbs. Bright acidity buoys that meaty quality in the form of tart rhubarb and strawberry tea flavors. Floral on the nose and palate, it's spicy too, with bold seasonings of clove and pepper."
Pinot Noir,"Sturdy and hard in tannins, brisk in acids, this Pinot will benefit from a year or so in bottle. It's extremely dry, with earthy, balsam and mushroom-inspired flavors of blackberries, black cherries and cola."
Pinot Noir,"This has acidity and tannins that are rich and complex. The raspberry, cola and licorice flavors have a nice coating of smoky oak."
Pinot Noir,"A vegetal touch marks this wine, which otherwise shows flavors of sour cherry candy and rhubarb."
Pinot Noir,This earthy wine presents barnyard flavors over the riper red fruit and licorice flavors. Drink now when the fruit is at its best.
Pinot Noir,"This is a beefy and potent bottling, with beef char, ripe cranberry, graphite and iron showing right away on the nose. The savory cooked-meat quality carries strongly to the palate, where complexity comes thanks to pencil lead, red-cherry fruit and baking spice."
Pinot Noir,"This broad, open, tongue-tickling wine comes on quickly with a blast of chocolate and cherries. Highlighted with an underpinning of tart raspberry jam, it's immediately accessible and utterly delicious. A hint of caramel crunch provides the perfect finale to this yum-fest of a wine."
Pinot Noir,"It's dry, silky and crisp, with pleasant sour cherry candy, pomegranate and rhubarb flavors. Drink now, although you do want to decant it for an hour or two."
Pinot Noir,"This medium- to full-bodied Pinot Noir has strong savory overtones. Leather and mushroom notes take charge early on and never let up, dominating the modest plum fruit and lingering on the finish. Drink up."
Pinot Noir,"Mellow, suave, complex and layered, this wine blends oaky spice flavors with delicious ripe fruit in a harmonious texture. It's medium-bodied, showing generous oak influence and a mouthfeel marked by firm tannins and acidity."
Pinot Noir,"Granular aromas of latex, plum and animal lead to a choppy piercing high-acid palate. Dilute flavors of generic berry fruits are candied on one hand and tart and weedy on the other."
Pinot Noir,"Hearty and plump aromas of plum and mulberry shine above the baked soil and cinnamon elements on the nose of this bottling from the Watsonville area. The texture is right down the middle, with even weight and expected acidity, allowing the flavors of anise and dark red fruit to arise."
Pinot Noir,"Ripe aromas are full of cherries and plums, with a hint of pine. Concentrated flavors recall dark cherries and cinnamon. The texture is full and broad with moderate tannins and fresh acidity to keep it lively."
Pinot Noir,"The Deux Verres spreads broadly across the palate, soft and slightly soapy. The simple fruit is accented with earth and mushroom highlights. It quickly fades and leaves behind a pleasant herbal note on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Pure notes of red fruits reach the nose: Morello cherry and mulberry harmonize beautifully. Their purity pervades a palate that has the lightest touch: there is something authentic, beautiful and unforced about this. There is a suggestion, too, of herb, moss or undergrowth. This unpretentious winemaking style lets this pure, glorious fruit speak for itself and brings with it a profound sense of honest depth, bountiful earth and full-fruited balance."
Pinot Noir,"This has a medium-garnet color, not overly dark, and the aromas are a bit restrained. However, the flavors ring out and range from higher notes of raspberry and cranberry to a bass note of black cherry for a whole octave of fruit. Classic firm acidity and tannins provide textural backbone and the finish, though lean, lingers."
Pinot Noir,"This unfiltered wine is cloudy in the glass and rides the low alcohol, low ripeness movement, showing a tangy nose of green olive, tart cranberry and herbaceous peppercorns. The palate is all about spice and savory elements, with lots of acidity and not much ripeness at all. Drink 2019–2029 to test the early picking trend."
Pinot Noir,"Pomegranate aromas on the fairly tight nose of this wine combine with sandalwood, hibiscus tang and minerality. It's tight, bright and rocky on the palate, with chipped slate flavors providing an earthy backbone to the cranberry fruit."
Pinot Noir,"Tart cranberry, wild thyme, olive and Indian spices show on the nose of this appellation blend, a great representation of the cool-climate styles this winery is known for. Kalamata olive and Mediterranean spices arise on the palate, with baked fig, orange rinds, preserved lemon and chaparral combining for a tagine-like expression."
Pinot Noir,"Delicate notes of earthy herbs and cola spice grace the red chery, currant, rhubarb and cranberry tones on the nose and mouth of this easygoing wine. It's light in weight and softly structured, with ample acidity lending freshness through the close."
Pinot Noir,"A fabulously rich and approachable Pinot Noir that offers everything now, yet will also age. The considerable tannins will protect it in the cellar for a good 6–8 years, but it's so fresh and vibrant in cherries, red currants and oak-inspired red licorice that it's hard not to drink it now. Hard to exaggerate the deliciousness factor."
Pinot Noir,"Though the listed alcohol tops 15%, this remains a fruity and rather simple wine, with dominating flavors of raspberry and cherry cola. As good as it is, this could use a bit more muscle."
Pinot Noir,"The estate reserve is simply a barrel selection that the winery feels represents the top 10% of their estate-grown Pinot Noir. Basically it offers quite similar flavors; for the extra money you get more butterfat, more cherry fruit and a little less herb. What it gains in power, the wine loses in detail and nuance; depending upon your own palate preferences, the regular estate might be the better value."
Pinot Noir,"A solid wine, finely constructed, its chunky tannins blending well with the red-plum-juice flavors. The acidity is important, along with the tasty cherry texture. Age for 3–4 years."
Pinot Noir,"This is still pretty stiff and tight through the midpalate, with fruit ranging from cranberry to raspberry and sour cherry. Tannins leave a slightly green impression; the wine doesn't seem ripe and full flavored. Some extra bottle age might improve it. Drink 2020 to 2024."
Pinot Noir,"Form one block of the vineyard, this wine offers a substantial cradling of oak, pushing the envelope on tart, savory aspects of flavor, from pine to cranberry, orange and rhubarb. With a gravelly texture, it has weight and depth."
Pinot Noir,Dark fruits—notably black cherries and figs—come with a chocolaty edge. The citrusy acids keep the wine on point as it slowly fades.
Pinot Noir,"This rich, creamy, juicy wine is full of strawberry fruits and ripe tannins. It has weight and density as well as powerful structure. A fresh black-cherry character comes through, giving acidity and a perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,"This popular vineyard, now almost 20 years old, yields a brambly Pinot Noir which might pass for a Sonoma Coast bottling. More elegant, almost steely, than many of the other Soléna vineyard designates, this offers cooler fruit flavors of rhubarb and wild strawberry, along with anise and dried herb."
Pinot Noir,"Tangy cherry flavors and a lip-smacking texture give a lot of life to this medium-bodied, tight and balanced wine. Great vibrancy comes from fruit flavors that are not overly ripe, and from moderate tannins and lively acidity that keep the mouthfeel fresh. A wonderful creaminess coats the tongue on the finish. Best after 2018."
Pinot Noir,"Bright raspberry and strawberry flavors kick off this well-balanced effort. It's buoyed by ample natural acidity and adorned with highlights of pastry and baking spices. It expands gracefully as it breathes, adding volume and density. Give this extra cellar time. It should drink best from 2018–2030."
Pinot Noir,"Appealing fruit aromas and flavors join a velvety texture in this medium-bodied and beautifully shaped wine. It doesn't go to extremes, but has just enough ripeness and freshness to find an elegant balance."
Pinot Noir,"From a hilltop location near the ocean-influenced town of Freestone, this wine is silky in plum and dark cherry, a hint of mushroomed earth doing its best to come out. Robust on the palate, juicy berry fruit satisfies, finishing thick and rich."
Pinot Noir,"There's a heady mix of smoke and bacon fat on this bottling from one of the appellation's top vineyards, along with baked red cherry and dried fennel, all swirling together in a very appealing manner. The hickory-smoke touches are more reserved on the sip, where tart strawberry mixes with licorice, marjoram and thyme."
Pinot Noir,"Wild cherry and sagebrush show on the nose of this fairly restrained bottling that doesn't rely on any new oak. Thyme and pepper spice show on the sip against a well-woven black-cherry frame. The acidity is balanced and the texture is soft, but the complexity is low."
Pinot Noir,"Exotic Asian spices and moody, brambly black fruit play at the center of this full-bodied vineyard-designate from a high-elevation site. Citrus, fresh-grated nutmeg and bright acidity make for a savory yet completely succulent experience that'll remain memorable long after the bottle is gone."
Pinot Noir,"A massive wine, rich and forward in black cherry and raspberry jam, red currant, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Structural integrity fortunately provides balance by way of crisp acidity, firm tannins and a rocky minerality. Enjoyable now, after decanting, and should age through 2019."
Pinot Noir,"A blend from several of the producer's finest vineyards, including Georganne, Flax, Olivet Lane and Klopp, this offers complex notes of smoky lavender and licorice. Velvety texture underlies mouth-coating flavors of blackberry jam, pomegranate and cardamom, finishing tartly in acidity."
Pinot Noir,"An untamed style of wine, with wild-fruit and ever-so-slight citrus aromatics. It's got a nice full body to it, with some creaminess in the mouth. Proper acids and a good application of oak keep it balanced. Bridgeview has a knack for making well-priced Pinot Noir that's fruity, friendly and complex enough to satisfy those who know and love the grape. This is a perfect case in point."
Pinot Noir,"Previously labeled as Les Gourmandises, this is now The Long Run in honor of Scott Wright's completing his first full-length marathon in 2011. It's all Nysa vineyard fruit, graceful and delicate, scented with rose water and satin smooth. Cranberry and wild strawberry fruit accents lead into a mouthful of cherry soda, delicate but lingering."
Pinot Noir,"Everything about this Pinot is upfront, but it's beautiful. Softly appealing, with a silky mouthfeel, it offers flattering raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with smoky, sweet, buttery notes. The softness suggests that the wine is not ageable."
Pinot Noir,"Byron’s first-ever wine from this justly famous vineyard. This wine flatters the senses from the get-go. The fruit is tremendously ripe, balanced and supple, with enough oak to lend it the requisite smoke and vanilla qualities and glyceriny sweetness. Soft, velvety, smooth and silky are just a few words to describe the mouthfeel."
Pinot Noir,"Funky aromas of red plum are leafy and come with an odd scent of clove. This feels grabby, while salty flavors of clove and dried-out red fruits finish mildly woody."
Pinot Noir,"Scents of cinnamon and red-pepper candy come up quickly, leading into a wine with terrific purity and focus. The raspberry and cherry fruits are clean and sharp, beautifully defined and balanced. Delicious young, this wine is set to develop further complexity if well cellared. Drink now through 2030."
Pinot Noir,"The winery says this is their earliest-picked fruit, which explains why the wine is leaner and earthier than their other bottlings. You'll find mushroom and green herb notes alongside the raspberries and cherries. Whether or not this extends the wine's ageability is arguable, but it does make it less appealing than, say, their Sun or Sky bottlings, which are riper."
Pinot Noir,"Dry, spicy, crisp aromas of cool-climate red fruits come with a mild covering of sweet oak. This is a touch resiny on the palate, with woody, spicy flavors of plum and raspberry. An oaky, lightly herbal finish is juicy in feel."
Pinot Noir,"While this is soft and fruity, it lacks all varietal resemblance. Drink it as a ripe red rather than as a Pinot Noir."
Pinot Noir,"This is a heavy, syrupy Pinot, with caramelized, candied raspberry, cherry and spice flavors."
Pinot Noir,"Pencil shavings, purple flowers, light cranberry fruit and hint of wood smoke show on the nose of this bottling. The smoked cherry character extends to the palate, with it picks up the tang of cranberry and a salty richness."
Pinot Noir,"This is a generous, tightly wound vineyard-designate that tastes more full-figured than it lists in terms of alcohol, jammy in dark plum and cardamom. It finishes with a ripe robustness of dark cherry fruit flavor and hint of earth."
Pinot Noir,"This young wine is finding its way, tight and grippy still, with a strong sense of oak and tannin. Leathery and savory, with a suggestion of the rustic, it offers a crispness of black cherry and plum on the finish. Drink now after a slight decanting."
Pinot Noir,"Made at a somewhat approachable price point, this blend of coastal vineyard sites holds back on fruit and texture. It provides a tightly closed and still youthful touch of savory herb and tea, finishing lean."
Pinot Noir,"A seamless commingling of cardamom and allspice around bursts of black cherry, this is a soft, dark and brooding wine, with an earthy soul and a spicy finish. Still young, it should take on further nuance over time, but is good to go right now."
Pinot Noir,"The Holstein designate offers pretty flavors of cherry and brambly berry, along with the Dr. Pepper character often found in Oregon. It's drinking well, though lacking the concentration that you would anticipate from the vintage and AVA."
Pinot Noir,"Owned by the same Henri Bourgeois family that produces a dizzying array of Loire wines, this tastes a bit like a Loire wine. It's lean and tart in style, with barely ripe fruit that is accented by herbal notes and a crisp finish. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"A likeable Pinot from a stalwart Anderson Valley vineyard, this Ferrington is light in color but rich with baked strawberry and violet. With a distinct woodsy component remniscent of forest floor, it's an ideal wine for wintertime meals adorned in mushrooms and herbs. Its finish is particularly sauvage."
Pinot Noir,"This light refreshing wine spent 16 months in 20% new French oak. The pretty berry fruit is elegantly set in complementary acids, with a streak of blond tea threading through the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Raspberry fruits and juicy acidity are allied to a softly tannic structure to give a ripe while fresh wine. It's fruity but with a firm, dry core that gives the potential to age 2016–2017."
Pinot Noir,"This pale pink wine presents light apricot and wet cement aromas. The palate sizzles with acidity, carrying citrus peel and earthy, clay-like flavors. It lacks only for a bit more fruit."
Pinot Noir,"Dark pink in the glass, this bubbly is incredibly foamy throughout the experience. It begins with aromas of strawberry, raspberry, plum and red apple, then explodes with bubbles on the palate, which make it hard to find the sour pomegranate and plum-skin flavors that eventually emerge."
Pinot Noir,"Grapes for this wine hail from both the cooler Green Valley subsection of the overlapping Russian River Valley and Sonoma Coast appellations, as well as from the Petaluma Gap, which is affected strongly by fog and wind. The result is a wine that opens in ripe aromas of raspberry and cherry before offering black tea and savory herb around a light-to-medium body and finish."
Pinot Noir,"A fairly subdued, mostly mineral-driven nose characterizes this wine by the Santa Clara Valley-based producer founded in 1978, with bits of brick and graphite most prevalent. The flavors are more prominent, with allspice-laced cherries, toasted oak and iron."
Pinot Noir,"One of a series of single-clone offerings from Kason, this has the lowest alcohol, which somehow partially helps to overcome the aggressive barrel flavors. Chunky black fruits and sweet oak combine in a muscular wine that shows none of the subtlety of the grape. It's Pinot Noir on steroids."
Pinot Noir,"The wine is ripe, balanced and likely to be ready to drink soon. With its plump fruitiness and texture, it is a full wine. Rich red-berry fruits are gently balanced by acidity and supported with a light layer of tannins. It will be very drinkable from late 2017."
Pinot Noir,"The second release of this Oregon Pinot project from Walla Walla's Jon Meuret (Maison Bleue) is irresistible. A three-clone blend from a top Columbia Gorge vineyard, it's explosively aromatic, with a strong whiff of pipe tobacco that Meuret believes is a vineyard marker. Those powerful aromatics push into a dense core of strawberry-cherry fruit, enhanced by oak notes. Delicious now, this has the structure and power to cellar well. Drink now through 2028."
Pinot Noir,"This Pinot Noir, named for a particular soil type in the Willamette valley, is scented strongly of the lumber smell you get at a building supplies store. There is a simple but pleasing layer of strawberry/raspberry fruit hidden in the wine's core. Perhaps a year or two of bottle age will pull things together."
Pinot Noir,"Here's a Pinot to drink now. It's a little on the soft, simple side, but tasty, with raspberry and cherry jam, cola, oak and spice flavors."
Pinot Noir,"This block-grown Pinot from the estate vineyard, in the heart of the cool Green Valley, shows the signature Marimar style of tight acidity, dryness, silky elegance and red fruit. It's not a big, fat, blockbuster Pinot, but a leaner, more masculine style. The raspberry, cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors should hold up well to the aging process. Now–2013, at least."
Pinot Noir,"An enormously rich Pinot Nor, stunningly delicious. Hard to imagine a California Pinot offering more opulent notes at such a young age. Dazzles with raspberry and cherry pie filling, vanilla, toast and scads of spices, and feels so soft, so silky, yet finishes so dry. Really a stunner. Should glidepath through the next six years, gradually growing mushroomy."
Pinot Noir,"Concentrated red fruits are matched to lushly toasty barrel flavors. This ripe and forward wine is ready right now. Textural in the mouth, it piles on the nuances, with toasted coconut, vanilla tea and a touch of stem threading through the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Shows a beautiful Pinotesque mouthfeel, all silk and satin, with that elegant Carneros acidity. But the flavors could be more concentrated. The cherries, cola and pomegranates feel a little watered down."
Pinot Noir,"The undesignated Pinot from Felton Road is normally a pretty approachable bottling, but in 2000, it's a big, brooding wine that needs time to unwind. Complex aromas of chocolate, dark plums and smoke are complemented by a hint of root vegetables. Finishes with notes of coffee and tart cherries."
Pinot Noir,"Light-bodied and yet offering a depth of complexity, this is resplendent in rhubarb and spicy anise, layered and textured in silky waves of fleshy flavor. A well balanced and approachable selection that's enjoyable now."
Pinot Noir,"This is a good value for a Sonoma Coast Pinot of this quality. The wine is dry, crisp and clean, with complex flavors of raspberry jam, pomegranates and heirloom tomatoes, which lend a satisfying earthiness to the fruit. New French oak is applied judiciously, and crisp acidity gives it delicious bite."
Pinot Noir,"This is a juicy wine, packed with red fruits. It has acidity along with an edge of tannins. The attractive fruitiness suggests the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,"This appellation blend is rich and lush with baked black-cherry aromas, touches of black cardamom and clove spice, and earthy rhubarb and beet notes. The palate packs a lot of forest-floor flavors, from loam to pine needles, into dark cranberry and tight raspberry fruit, leveled by pepper and pencil lead."
Pinot Noir,"Light and delicate, it attracts more for its stylish finesse than for any power or ageability. Berry and earth flavors are framed in modest tannins and soft acids, and there's some bitterness from the middle palate through the finish."
Pinot Noir,This is a uniquely layered Pinot with concentrated dark-cherry liqueur flavor wrapped in notes of mushroom and dirt. The finish is bright and long-lasting. This one calls for chanterelles sautéed with plenty of olive oil and bacon bits.
Pinot Noir,"This coastal Pinot exhibits ripeness, but also hints of green bitterness. It's dry and crisp with acidity, and boasts flavors of sour cherry candy, cranberry, baking spice and sweet oak. It's not likely to be a longterm ager so give it 1–2 years and enjoy."
Pinot Noir,"Other than a sugary sweetness, this wine shows all the hallmarks of a very nice Pinot Noir from this famed vineyard. The raspberry, cherry and vanilla flavors are accented by dusty spices, and the texture is silky. But the wine just doesn't taste dry."
Pinot Noir,"A new effort from DDO, this drops Domaine Drouhin from the name, and puts the vineyard name front and center. It's young and well-crafted, with strawberry and cherry fruit. The potential is evident for an impressive site once the vines get some age under them."
Pinot Noir,"This fruity, friendly Pinot opens with ripe berry aromas mixed with touches of minerality and latex. It feels fresh and sturdy, with black cherry and raspberry flavors. A pure, sweet, lightly chocolaty finish wraps things up."
Pinot Noir,"This very elegant nose is like a love potion perfume of violet, sterling rose, myrrh and raspberry essence. The flavors veer toward tart raspberry and cranberry, with cola and purple flowers coming through before a brisk acidic finish."
Pinot Noir,"This smells like a forest fire, but it's also creamy and roasted. Tangy and tart, this features narrow plum and cherry flavors that are powered by blazing acidity."
Pinot Noir,"Here's a supple, delicious Pinot Noir. The wine is elegantly silky, with satisfying flavors of cherries, currants, Dr. Pepper, smoky vanilla and fresh Provençal herbs. It has a good edge of tannins."
Pinot Noir,"This is a concentrated wine, with intense flavors of cherry and red currant. There's a tug of the earth by way of minerals and dried herbs. It's splendid acidity and firm tannins give it wonderful structure. It's an ager, so it should hold out at least through 2017."
Pinot Noir,"Ripe and juicy, this is a well-structured wine with both delicious red fruits and a core of serious tannins. The wine has weigh, richness and a opulence that comes from great fruits. The result is a wine with beautiful character that will develop well. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,"While forward, plump red-cherry and strawberry notes are buoyant, a deep vein of granite and minerals adds gravitas and complexity to this elegant wine. Fresh cranberry acidity drives a swift finish."
Pinot Noir,"A troubled Pinot Noir. The mouthfeel is all wrong, lacking Pinot's sensuality, but marked by harshness. And the raspberry and cherry flavors have a green, minty edge. Not likely to age, so if you drink it now, give it a good long decant."
Pinot Noir,"This is quite an interesting Pinot Noir. With a scent of mushrooms, cola and cherry pie and good acidity, it's Burgundian, with a pale color and a light, silky body. The alcohol is relatively high, but the wine wears it well. Although it's drinking well now, the wine should get a little better over the next 4–6 years."
Pinot Noir,"This is a chewy, generous and expansive vineyard-designated wine, dense and fulsome in savory cranberry, cardamom and streaks of black tea. Full bodied, its layers of texture are soft and velvety, and the finish lengthy in spice."
Pinot Noir,"This bottling comes from two Pinot clones planted within a 6.5-acre vineyard in Blucher Valley, a frigid, low-yielding site. On the edge of ripeness, the wine is unusual in orange pith, cranberry and pomegranate with a vividly tangy crispness. Soy, balsam and pine tar provide an edgy character that adds complexity and texture."
Pinot Noir,"Cloudy Bay's latest vintage is the first from their own vineyards in Central Otago and reflects a step up in quality despite a challenging vintage. Plummy fruit dominates the rather chunky wine, framed by hints of toast and dried herbs, while moderately dusty tannins and bright acids mark the finish. Drink 2018–2025."
Pinot Noir,"There are some unripe, vegetal flavors in this Pinot Noir. It's dry and simple, although it does boast some cherry and currant flavors, and has a nice, silky texture. Ready now."
Pinot Noir,"With just a touch of bitterness and structure, this is a finely textured wine. It has plenty of fresh red and white fruit flavors, a lively, busy mousse and a tight acidity on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"From the former Ashley's Vineyard, which the Parker family sold a few years ago, comes this tough, acidic young wine. It shows a maritime influence in the dry tartness and bitter cherryskin flavors. Could be a sleeper."
Pinot Noir,"This is Coppola's best 2011 Pinot Noir, out of several produced under different brand names. It has a stylish mouthfeel of silk and satin that's pure Pinot. Meanwhile, the flavors are lush, suggesting oak-influenced raspberries."
Pinot Noir,"Round and fruity, this mixes sweet berry with red plum and Bing cherry. Orange-peel highlights lift the midpalate. The wine shows excellent balance and a detailed, lingering finish."
Pinot Noir,"This is a solid, sharply defined, taut wine with a refined core of cherry fruit. The through-line is straight and true, finishing with a lick of citrus. Give this one a little more time to smooth itself out, and drink with pleasure after 2018."
Pinot Noir,"Hibiscus, rose petal and sour cranberry kick off the nose of this bottling, but its most compelling aroma is the stark and ethereal minerality, recalling iron and crushed gravel. Strawberry fruit pops on the palate, as does ripe cranberry, but that earthy soil and crushed rock quality rises to the top again."
Pinot Noir,"Dark and dense upon opening, this compact, concentrated cuvée matches its muscular fruit to polished tannins. Black cherry dives deep, almost to the level of black currant fruit, and brings a streak of black olive. This impressive effort will drink well now through 2025."
Pinot Noir,"This vineyard, often featured in the Sineann lineup, moves over to WildAire for this sensational debut. The blend is a two-clone mix of 777 and Pommard, and it captures a range of delicate, well-defined flavors. Raspberry, cherry, light char, smoke, pepper, bitter herb, vanilla and camomile tea come rolling through. The prime location, which borders on Jadot's Résonance vineyard, contributes a great deal, but the winemaking brings it on home."
Pinot Noir,"This firm wine fits well with the image of Pommard. A tannic core contrasts with the potential of the red cherry fruits. Wood aging is still prominent, and the wine needs time to balance out. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,"A wine with great color, attractive smoky and red fruit flavors and a touch of tannin. It has a good structure as well, reflecting wood aging as well as fine fruit. Drink from 2016."
Pinot Noir,"This Pinot is crisp and delicately structured, with a silky texture. But the cola, raspberry and red currant flavors are thin, leading to a fast finish. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"The nose on this Pinot is delicate, perfumed faintly with crisp black cherry, rose petal and spice. The palate is markedly riper, streaked by fleshy black plums and cranberry acidity. It's straightforward in its fruitiness yet balanced smartly, finishing on a fine, yet penetrating, tannic note."
Pinot Noir,"Initially dense and brooding, this wine reveals lightly etched layers of cherry and strawberry on the palate. Just the right accent of earthy dirt and stone round out the finish."
Pinot Noir,"This comes out of the bottle a little tarry and rubbery, so splash it around a bit while pouring, or opt for a quick decant if that's possible. Once those off aromas dissipate, the wine delivers plenty of herb-tinged cherry fruit, with a medium body and a mouthwatering, fine-grained finish."
Pinot Noir,"This marvelous vineyard has not been featured by Elk Cove previously. The characteristic blackberry fruit shines through, but winemaker Adam Campbell has wrapped it in the sort of elegant, lightly herbal, spicy flavors that define the Elk Cove style. Perfectly ripened at 14.5% alcohol, this wine manages to be both fruity and complex, open and layered."
Pinot Noir,"With luscious raspberry, cherry and vanilla flavors, this silky Pinot is ready to drink now. It has a good structure of tannins and acids, as well as lots of new oak, which it handles well."
Pinot Noir,"Any winemaker will tell you how difficult it is to make Pinot Noir in large volumes, so this is a notable achievement. Delicate herb and cherry aromas pick up vanilla shadings on the palate, then finish with a silky texture and a hint of tomato leaf. 10,000 cases imported."
Pinot Noir,"This wine leans more toward the earthy, savory side of Pinot Noir, yet still boasts enough plum and black cherry fruit to please most consumers. It's medium bodied, with a velvety or suede-like texture and hints of root vegetables, mushrooms, sassafras and cola. Ready to drink."
Pinot Noir,"This is a juicy, fruit-forward selection, boasting vibrant notes of red cherry, raspberry and strawberry on the nose and mouth. A hint of vanilla adds a sweetness to the finish, which otherwise ends clean and mouthwatering. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Fresh raspberry and Bing cherry juice meet with wet black slate, rain on cement and toasted sagebrush scents on the nose of this block-selection expression. The palate opens with ripe red berry, then tightens on slightly sour cranberries, with singing acidity down the middle and a warmer anise tinge to the edges."
Pinot Noir,"This well-balanced Pinot Noir shows red-cherry fruit, with complex hints of anise, star anise, thyme and even tarragon on the nose. Both the acidity and tannic structure are lively but not aggressive, carrying tart cherry flavors deep into the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Created by Joshua Klapper, the fine winemaker at La Fenetre, for Santa Monica's Fig Restaurant, this wine is balanced in alcohol and subtle, but complex in its array of fruits, spices, earth, oak, tannins and acids. If you're in the area, check it out."
Pinot Noir,"Red-berry aromas are damp, mulchy and not fully fresh. On the palate, this wine feels sticky, while flavors of briny, herbal red-berry fruits turn salty on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Softly floral and brightly spicy, this wine rocks in red cherry and tangy citrus, sure to please a broad range of palates in its approachable elegance and restraint. Toasted vanilla oak rounds out the finish."
Pinot Noir,"The 2009 Torii Mors are not widely separated in style or substance. The Select is smooth and fruity, with citrusy acids and light red-berry flavors. It's ready to drink, but does not show the depth or detail for long-term aging."
Pinot Noir,"Superripe in raspberries and cherries, with a strong coating of sweet, smoky oak, this Pinot Noir is a little lacking in subtlety. But it has excellent acidity, minerality and even some firm tannins, and that structure gives it elegance. A bit brusque now, but will be fascinating to watch it develop over the next six years."
Pinot Noir,"A vegetal note drags down the enjoyment. On the plus side, the wine is nice and silky, with good acidity and raspberry, cherry and fig flavors. But that tug of asparagus is a problem."
Pinot Noir,"A new, reserve-level wine from the producer's estate Winside Vineyard, Laura is both floral and sauvage, spicy, dense and full-figured. Blackberry compote and black-cherry pie come to mind through its intensity, while it ends packed in tight-grained tannins. Drink now through 2023."
Pinot Noir,"A welcome new entry in the burgeoning Oregon sparkling wine scene, this vintage-dated, all Pinot Noir cuvée can stand right alongside the best in the U.S. Details in both aroma and flavor bring elements of sweet hay, lemon rind, pineapple and green apple, with fine bead and impressive length."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is soft and fruity, with a smoky touch that adds interest. Red-cherry flavors and balanced acidity allow easy accessibility. The wine, with its gentle texture, is ready to drink."
Pinot Noir,"This cuvée reflects the lean vintage with modest alcohol and slightly dilute fruit flavors. Pretty aromatics suggest rosewater and sandalwood, and the wine fades gracefully with plum and cherry fruit."
Pinot Noir,"Despite its single-vineyard designation, this watery effort could be from anywhere. Thin, dilute, barely ripe strawberry fruit vanishes quickly once in the mouth, and there is little trace of any barrel flavors from aging in 20% new French oak."
Pinot Noir,"Very smoky aromas, the fruit ripe with sweet blackberry flavors. The wood is still very present, not yet completely integrated; there is a touch of green perhaps from the wood. At the same time, the wine is developing while keeping a fresh streak of acidity."
Pinot Noir,"Brambly raspberry aromas are accented with a dusting of minerals on this dry, refreshing rosé. The palate is delicate with subtle red-cherry flavor but finishes elegantly with a lingering cherry blossom perfume."
Pinot Noir,"Flavor-wise, this is a huge wine, bursting with raspberries, cherries and persimmons. The texture is pure silk and satin, as light and airy as Pinot gets, yet with a ghostly weight. Drink now with your most Pinot-friendly foods."
Pinot Noir,"This blend of many vineyard lots seems less than the sum of its parts. Pungently herbal with characteristic Oregon tomato leaf tannins, its fruit remains hidden beneath the tannins. Age may enhance its beauty, but for the moment it remains tight and unyielding, with suggestions of heat around the cranberry/pomegranate fruit."
Pinot Noir,"Starts with creamy, oak-based aromas of milk chocolate and mocha, yet the fruit notes below are kind of short and briary. Flavors of strawberry also come with sharper hints of rhubarb, while the finish is medium in length, balanced and tastes of chocolate. Not a bad effort for Chile. 2,500 cases made."
Pinot Noir,"This wine features the signature, woodsy, savory aromas of Phillips Hill. It has a lighter, slightly tawny color compared with most of its peers from Anderson Valley. Flavors combine spice and fruit with meaty, mushroomy notes, giving character and personality to a delicious wine."
Pinot Noir,"Blush wines from Pinot Noir can be all over the map. But this one lands squarely on the dry, balanced side, offering crisp flavors of cherries, rose petals, orange tea, cloves and cinnamon. Superversatile with a wide range of foods, it's a good by-the-glass wine for restaurants."
Pinot Noir,"The Suremain family winery in the main street of Mercurey has cellars going back to the 17th century. This wood-aged wine will have been kept here, where it has developed into a structured and firm wine, full of dry tannins as well as ripe red-berry fruits. Drink from 2023."
Pinot Noir,"This south-facing vineyard has produced a well-balanced wine. The tannins are gentle, enveloped by the juicy red-fruit flavor and the mineral acidity. It is ripe, full of fruit with a crisp, tight aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,"For a Volnay, this is a very structured wine. It has huge richness laced with firm tannins and dark fruits. It is the firmness that dominates, suggesting some extra extraction, although the acidity does push right through to the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Smells like pink bubblegum, tastes like sugary cherry pie filling. Even at this price, it's not a bargain."
Pinot Noir,"NEXT is a new label for King Vintners, a new division of King Estate. This blends grapes from southern Oregon and the Willamette Valley, putting a pleasing toasty character around the light red fruit. A streak of burnt coffee suggests that the barrel influence is still being integrated."
Pinot Noir,"Principally blended from Abbey Ridge vineyard fruit, this offers red plum and cherry fruit, with a distinct streak of pineapple. Native yeast was employed, along with aging in one-quarter new oak, adding hints of Asian spices. The length and balance are impressive."
Pinot Noir,"Good price for a deliciously drinkable Pinot Noir. It's silky and a little sweet in raspberries, brown sugar and bacon flavors. Easy to drink and at this price, it can be your house Pinot."
Pinot Noir,"The 2015 vintage is a strong one for Woodbridge. Ripe fruit tones, bright acidity and lightly mouth-puckering tannins underpin red cherry, clove and blackberry flavors, while the texture is mouthfilling. It's a treat to find an inexpensive wine with such good backbone."
Pinot Noir,"From an estate vineyard, this wine is somewhat unformed and quite feral, largely tannic, with a rough-hewn texture. The oak is overwhelming and needs time to settle, to better reveal the abundance of strawberry and cherry fruit."
Pinot Noir,"Give this polished Pinot an hour or two of decanting and serve it now with a good steak, or try prosciutto-wrapped dates for an exotic appetizer. It's dry, rich and spicy, with ripe cherry, red currant, cola and bacon flavors, edged with sweet, smoky sandalwood."
Pinot Noir,"Sharp and tangy, this assertive wine shows a well-integrated mix of berry, cherry, sassafras and herb. Lightly dusted with fresh earth, it does a gentle fade through the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Rich fruit meets hearty earth on this bottling, with aromas of baked cranberry, candied cherry and pomegranate alongside juniper, forest floor and ginger snap. The fresh berry and pomegranate juice-led palate is enhanced by cinnamon and clove, touched by dried orange-rind bitterness."
Pinot Noir,Drouhin has significant holdings in a number of top Chambolle vineyards. This wine is a blend from other Premier Crus in the same village. It has the typical generous character along with a more serious structured backbone that gives a dry and solid density that's worth aging. Drink from 2017.
Pinot Noir,"The Stewart cuvée is lightly smoky, with plenty of up-front flavor. It marries cherry fruit to citrusy acidity, with a chunky, robust core and a crisp, clean finish."
Pinot Noir,"Fresh and fruity, this is full of red cherry flavors and crisp acidity. It has some age, hinting at a more toasty future. For the moment, it's at its best after eight years aging on the lees in the bottle."
Pinot Noir,"There's a rugged earthiness and delicious meaty character to this fantastic bottling, which shows dried cranberries, dried olallieberry, smoked pork and hummingbird sage on the brawny nose. A similar power infects the palate, where red and black cherry meet with plum, mulberry, cola, shaved chocolate and a deepening sage character, finishing on crushed mint."
Pinot Noir,"Exceptionally ripe and forward with blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam flavors, this wine is accented with hints of savory spice and a smoky jacket of oak. It's a good wine, flashy and succulent, yet a little soft and hot in alcohol. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Elegant structure on this wine, with a graceful silkiness, although it's a bit lacking in concentration, especially at this price. Shows jammy cherry, raspberry and spice flavors, with a coating of smoky oak."
Pinot Noir,"From the estate vineyard of a winery founded in 1994 by Silicon Valley mogul TJ Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor, the grapes must be picked by a special tractor-on-wires because they are so steeply planted. Like the other 2009s, this Pinot Noir is characterized by strong tannins, meaning that it will last. Unlike the others, this one boats a more mushroom-driven nose between shiitake and porcini, with a touch of mocha. The palate reveals caramelized raspberry, graphite and silty flavors."
Pinot Noir,"Briary plum, cherry and lemony oak aromas ride high on this dark, aggressive PN. Feels full and bullish, with dark, lemony flavors that suggest black fruit but never really get there. Finishes fiery, with size and heat."
Pinot Noir,"A stunning return to the quality that was seen in 2008, this superb effort bursts onto the palate with brambly berries, sweet herbs, coffee grounds and somewhat stiff, but polished, tannins. It's complex, with a touch of earthiness and generous length. The label reads Willamette Valley, though the vineyard is in the Chehalem Mountains AVA."
Pinot Noir,"With spice and dark coffee flavors, this wine shows some wood aging. It also has considerable acidity and the brightest strawberry fruit. Lively and fragrant at the end, it can be drunk now."
Pinot Noir,"Earthy and gritty cherry, tomato and herbal aromas set up a grabby, sticky, caramelized palate. Flavors of brown sugar and generic berry fruits finish with a hint of sweet chocolate. This is good but short on traditional Pinot Noir character."
Pinot Noir,"Luscious and seriously structured, this is a wine that offers the dense texture of a Gevrey Grand Cru vineyard. It has rich fruit, touched by chocolate and licorice, as well as ripe black fruits. For aging over 4–5 years and more."
Pinot Noir,"This estate vineyard is generally prone to cool-site characteristics, meaning more of an emphasis on leaf and root and herb. Peppery herb and tart red fruits combine in an elegant, precise midpalate, suggesting wild strawberry and carrying a dash of sea salt caramel through the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Done in what can deservedly be called a European style, this low-alcohol, delicate wine offers varietally correct scents and flavors, with a lightly woodsy character."
Pinot Noir,"Sourced from two vineyards, including Sangiacomo Amaral Ranch, a cool site near the bay, this is a tremendous offering for the price. The wine is light, bright and brambly in raspberry and cherry kirsch, with a mischievous streak of cola. Pretty and fresh, it finishes in a tease of black tea."
Pinot Noir,"Quite reserved in aroma, this bottling from Duckhorn made with fruit from a Dierberg-owned site shows light cranberry and chaparral scents on the nose. The palate is straight-forward with tangy cranberry and cedar flavors."
Pinot Noir,"Light-bodied and crisp, this delivers tart cherries and a whack of mocha-tinged oak, which dominates the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Earthy aromas of turned soil meet with dark red currant and a layer of smoke on the nose of this estate bottling by the historic vineyard. Strawberry, smoked pork and a touch of lavender show on the sip, which rides a strong acidity that arises in the midpalate and persists deep into the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Fresh, light aromas of raspberry and milk chocolate give the wine legitimacy, but for the most part it's simply a lean, sassy Pinot with racy red-fruit flavors, warmth and a touch of sweet oak. Rudimentary but varietally correct with few flaws or virtues. Good but wholly basic."
Pinot Noir,"Soft and aromatic, the wine is fruity with open tannins and plenty of acidity. It is smooth and developing quickly, showing its red-currant fruit. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,"Rich succulent black cherry and berry notes mingle with swathes of ripe bramble and dried sage in this bold full-bodied Pinot Noir. Unabashedly luscious and fringed by a feathery fray of tannins, its forward but refined nature is appealing now."
Pinot Noir,"Good vineyard sources and a flavorful mix of raspberry, cranberry and rhubarb characterize this aromatic and spicy Pinot Noir. Well-balanced and lightly herbal, it finishes with medium length and should be consumed over the next 3–5 years."
Pinot Noir,Aromas and flavors like prunes and strawberry jam make an unusual combination in this full-bodied and uncomplicated wine. It is certainly fruity and generous in personality.
Pinot Noir,"This distinctive wine has a light to medium color, with complex and somewhat earthy aromas. Very tasty and diverse flavors suggest black tea and rhubarb. It has medium body, a soothing, smooth texture and lingering finish."
Pinot Noir,"This particular block was first planted in 2007, so these are young vines. Sometimes fruit from young vines will burst forth in spectacular fashion, and that's the case here. Supremely aromatic, this opens with a velvety mix of Asian spices, fruit leather, plum, cherry, cocoa powder and coffee grounds. All this and more can be tasted as well as sniffed, with excellent penetration through a lingering, cedary finish."
Pinot Noir,Jammy aromas and equally ripe sweet fruit flavors give this wine a candied character. It's full-bodied and feels a little warm on the finish.
Pinot Noir,"This young wine may need more time to reveal itself; though Resonance is proven as a top vineyard, here it seems shuttered and not yet woven together. Tart berry and cherry fruit turns sour in the finish, and does not display the power and depth of which it is capable."
Pinot Noir,"Wild berries, cranberries and pungent herbaceousness characterize this Barrel Select Pinot Noir. It seems a little light at first, then gathers itself in a focused, spicy midpalate that nicely integrates the fruit and herbs."
Pinot Noir,"This firm Pinot Noir has made subtle use of wood aging to round out and become rich. Red cherry fruits fill the mouth with soft tannins and toasty spice giving some complexity. The wine could age, although it is ready to drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Concentrated oak aromas and flavors are the hallmarks of this medium-bodied, full-flavored and attractively priced wine. Lush plum and black-cherry notes vie for attention, but oaky accents like cedar, nutmeg and cinnamon stay in the forefront from the aroma through the soft texture to the finish."
Pinot Noir,"A fine, solid Pinot, showing the tart acidity, delicate silkiness and tight structure of the coast, in a wine to drink now. The flavors are flashy and complex, with sour cherry candies, cranberries and toasty oak."
Pinot Noir,"While light-bodied, gentle and intricate, this wine offers plenty of flavor nuances. Cranberry and herb tea aromas mark the nose, while the mouthfeel is at once soothing and tangy, with mulled cherry and clove aromas that slowly emerge and persist on the finish. It's a treat to sip and savor."
Pinot Noir,"Bright and peppery with spice, this bottling from Ed Kurtzman delivers all that's lovable about Pinot Noir in a fresh, light style. Its raspberry fruit is accented and lifted by bay leaf, thyme and white pepper notes, with a saline hint of kalamata olive. That boundless energy continues on the palate, where crisp pomegranate blends with marjoram."
Pinot Noir,"Very rich and sumptuous, if a little heavy. It's delicious and complex, with cherry, mocha and red currant flavors that finish sweet and spicy. You'll experience a hit of tannins that provides structure, but makes the wine slightly unaccessible. Aging is a gamble, given a certain pruniness on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Soft and rich, with appealing flavors of chocolate, cherry and butterscotch, this is a seductive wine. It is ripe but not hot, and the chocolaty richness wraps around the sweet cherry fruit but retains just enough of the leafy quality that defines it as Oregon. Nice balance and structure too."
Pinot Noir,"A bright, fresh example of Pinot Noir, this is medium bodied and slightly creamy in texture as well. Bold notes of red cherries and beet greens add hints of button mushroom on the palate, then finish tart and refreshing. Drink now–2016."
Pinot Noir,"Not showing the richness of the fabulous 2005 vintage, but a very nice wine nonetheless. Bone dry and rich in citrusy acids, its flavors veer toward cherry skins, orange zest, cola, anise and pepper."
Pinot Noir,"Sourced from the Omaka Valley, this Pinot Noir is fermented and aged in 1000-liter casks, hence the Big Barrel moniker. It's medium bodied and silky in texture, with only minimal oak-derived flavor. Instead it offers crisp red fruits like cherries and pomegranates, plus subtle hints of tomato leaf and smoked meat. Drink now–2021."
Pinot Noir,"A little rugged around the edges, with jagged tannins that emphasize the acidity. But it's dry and balanced, and you'll find ripe flavors of cherries, pomegranates, red licorice and toast. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"There is a voluptuous edge to this generous wine. It has rich flavors, some strawberry and plum juice. The final extreme freshness shows through the layer of firm tannins. For aging over 4–5 years."
Pinot Noir,"Soft and earthy, this Pinot has good raspberry and cherry fruit and cola flavors, and a nice application of oak. But it lacks the structure to give it liveliness. Drink up."
Pinot Noir,"Striking acidity adds freshness to more rustic characteristics of cooked red fruit, caramelized sugar and hay on this medium-bodied Pinot. Brambly on the palate with hints of mushroom and foliage, it finishes clean with just a trace of tannins."
Pinot Noir,"The Crossings is based in the Awatere subregion of Marlborough, where ripening is more difficult than the main valley because of cooler temperatures. That evidently wasn't an issue in 2013, as this wine features ripe black-cherry fruit and a creamy texture. Hints of herb and cocoa chime in on the supple finish."
Pinot Noir,This is a crisp cherry-flavored wine. Cool-climate Pinot Noir has a light texture that gives the wine a hint of tannins although it is much more about fruit and bright acidity. Drink now.
Pinot Noir,"From a vineyard poised along Eastside Road, this wine is juicy in flavor and dense in color and on the palate upon entry. Marked by great, well-defined acidity, it's gorgeously floral in fresh rose petal and orange peel with just a touch of reduction, with an additional weight of black tea and cranberry."
Pinot Noir,"This well-made wine brings briary, brambly notes to its core raspberry fruit. The impression of light herbaceousness continues through a medium-long finish, with a hint of thistle and wet stone. The wine spent 10 months in 50% new French oak."
Pinot Noir,"Despite showing a note of vinegar on the nose, this benefits from a good offset of red-berry perfume and leathery scents. This feels tight, rubbery and a bit tannic, with plum, raspberry and spice flavors leading to a solid finish. For Chilean Pinot Noir, this is good but not spectacular."
Pinot Noir,"Rather aggressive tannins and distinctly earthy scents of tomato leaf and vegetation characterize this modest effort. It's chewy and herbal, with little indication of fruit ripeness."
Pinot Noir,"A brooding, savory and smoothly textured wine, velvety more than silky, this offers black tea, truffle and high-toned cherry. The wine is named for sandstone, “mother rock” of the Goldridge soils that are so prominent where these vines dig down. Soft, it's also lengthy, a substantial and substantive bottling."
Pinot Noir,"This blend of grapes from three different Columbia Gorge vineyards is immediately appealing, with round, smoky, relatively soft and accessible flavors. It's smooth and seductive, offering bright cherry fruit augmented with that smoky streak and a whiff of tobacco in the finish."
Pinot Noir,"A single-barrel reserve, this wine is compact and concentrated—a perfectly melded blend of fruit, barrel and acidity. It's a refined, beautifully polished wine, with just a touch of butterscotch wrapped into the finish. Drink now through 2030. If enjoyed soon, give it some time in the decanter to open up."
Pinot Noir,"Blended from several Central Otago subregions, this is a supple, immediately drinkable wine. Oak spice and vanilla notes mark the nose, while the midpalate fills in with crisp red fruit reminiscent of cranberries. It's medium bodied, with a silky texture that lingers on the finish. Drink now–2022."
Pinot Noir,"A standard Pinot Noir, soft and extracted in cherry and raspberry pie filling. It has a nice, silky texture and good acidity."
Pinot Noir,"From what's becoming one of the most heralded vineyards in the region, this bottling shows wet cement, baked plums, blackberry, thyme and black sage on the nose. Boysenberry fruit comes first on the sip, followed by tart orange peel, a touch of green olive and more fresh thyme flavors."
Pinot Noir,"The most affordable of Harper Voit's 2013 lineup, this deeply aromatic wine offers up a lush mix of rose petals and other perfumed floral scents, along with hints of rhubarb and cherry. Elegant on the palate, it's a poised and balanced wine that brings to mind the old line about Ginger Rogers doing everything Fred Astaire did, only backwards and in high heels. Here the dance includes ripe strawberries, cherries, flowers and a long, graceful encore."
Pinot Noir,"There's lots of mouthwatering acidity in this bone-dry Pinot Noir, with an ample supply of ripe fruit in the form of raspberries and cherries. There's also something wonderfully earthy, like roasted mushrooms splashed with balsamic and tamari sauce. The cool 2010 vintage was kind to Bacigalupi Vineyard, which can produce overripe wines in hot years."
Pinot Noir,"Lightweight and lacking in texture, this wine offers fading red-cherry fruit, cola notes and leafy greens. Drink up."
Pinot Noir,"Always at the top of the Chilean Pinot heap is this true, complex wine from Kingston Family. The nose features light raspberry, citrus, oceanic brine and toasty, creamy oak. The palate is lush and rolls across the tongue with ease; ripe fruit in the cherry zone along with cocoa and spice make for fine flavors. Finishes with purity, smooth tannins and herbal twinges."
Pinot Noir,"Chaparral scrub and hibiscus combine on the rather light and dainty nose. Iron, tart cranberry and riper pomegranate pop on the palate, which has good energy and is fairly straightforward and simple."
Pinot Noir,"An aroma like red-apple skin and modest red cherry and plum flavors make a good combination in this medium-bodied, subtly styled wine. It tastes dry, nicely crisp, yet smooth in texture."
Pinot Noir,The honeyed notes on the nose almost have a savory soy-scented quality. These savory notes of stone and yeast also hover on the palate which is dry and replaces primary fruit with honeyed fluidity against the canvas of yeasty autolysis. This works not only as a dry refreshing apéritif but as an accompaniment to delicate foods.
Pinot Noir,"Produced from old vines, this textured, solid wine has a tight and firmly tannic character. Underneath, red cherry fruits are already releasing a fragrant side and the potential of bright fruitiness. Drink from 2016."
Pinot Noir,"This bottling is showing a touch of age on the nose, with clove, allspice and black-plum aromas most prominent. Dried ginger spices up the dried fig and plum on the sip, which approaches prune as well. Drink up now before more age sets in."
Pinot Noir,"Rich and dense, this concentrated wine has a fine, smooth texture that is ripe with red-berry fruits. The freshness of the vintage comes through in the acidity and crisp, taut texture. The wine will be ready to drink from 2020, the 800th anniversary of the oldest-known traces of this vineyard."
Pinot Noir,"This is a concentrated wine, full with dry tannins and perfumed red fruits. Hints of the wood aging give the wine toast and smokiness. The fresh fruits form a contrast offering a future of fragrance and stylishness. It needs to age, so wait until 2019."
Pinot Noir,"There's a beechwood smoke touch to the nose of this bottling, accenting a core of dried purple flowers and black raspberry. It's well integrated on the palate, where smoke and dark, tangy fruit mix with white pepper and an acidity that carries its flavors into the finish."
Pinot Noir,"The largest of the four grands crus in Morey-Saint-Denis, this vineyard gives the most structured wines. This bottling, with its tannins and power, is no exception. While it shows plenty of rich black, perfumed fruit, it also has an immense structure of tight tannins are balanced by juicy acidity. Drink from 2027."
Pinot Noir,"Exceptionally rich, a Pinot Noir that tastes dramatic from the get go. It's full-bodied, dry and velvety, with complex flavors of berries, pomegranates, cherries, cola, currants, mushrooms and spices. The firm tannins and crisp acids suggest ageability over the next six years."
Pinot Noir,"A stunningly delicious Pinot Noir, opulent in raspberry, cherry, red currant, red licorice, cola and beef jerky flavors. Impossible not to be impressed by the richness, yet the tannin-acid structure is wonderful and bracing. Doesn't seem likely to age well, so drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Svelte, focused and very appealing, this block selection has a slightly roasted aspect, with flavors of plum and cherry. There's a sweet spicy coating around the finishing tannins. It was fermented with native yeast, and aged 15 months in one-quarter new French oak."
Pinot Noir,"Big and bold, this is real Chambertin, a dense mouthful of plum fruit and tannin. It is foursquare, solid but not overbearing, leaving room for a delicious mix of black fruits and power leavened with some acidity. Age this wine for 10 years."
Pinot Noir,"Young Pinot Noir can sometimes dazzle you with juicy expressive downright sensational fruit, as this does. Though tasted prior to its official release, the wine drinks beautifully, offering a big hit of citrus flesh and rind along with lovely raspberry and blueberry fruit. It's forward, fresh, balanced tightly against its lush acidity, and is already just about irresistible."
Pinot Noir,"A sweet-seeming oakiness fills the aroma of this full-bodied, ripe-tasting wine from a Pinot Noir specialist. It smells like vanilla, cinnamon, and maple and tastes generous and rich, with layers of cherry and cola flavors. The texture is soft and full, keeping the ripe fruit lingering on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Crisp raspberry tart is the prominent flavor in this wine that is intoxicatingly alluring on the nose, bright in pomegranate and dried herb. Minerality surrounds the savory, light-bodied core, the finish bracing in black peppery spice."
Pinot Noir,"Really beautiful. Walks right up to the tartness line, but never crosses it, with rich, citrusy acidity framing ripe, complex flavors of cherries, currants, cola, pomegranates, sandalwood and Asian spices. Clean and pure, and an ager. Now–2013."
Pinot Noir,"A touch of mushroom and vegetable unripeness runs through this Pinot. It's not entirely unpleasant, but it does interfere with your enjoyment of the fruit. Drink this silky, dry wine now."
Pinot Noir,"Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade."
Pinot Noir,"Big, tannic and fruity, giving an intense structure of black plums laced with sweet raspberries. It exudes richness and power, generous while also firm."
Pinot Noir,"This is a big, meaty wine that wears its youthfulness on its sleeve, showing a touch of reduction and assertive oak. Beneath its wall of ripeness, black licorice, cherry and pomegranate characteristics are buoyed by a depth of thick tannin."
Pinot Noir,"Feels heavy and ponderous now, almost like a common Grenache, and might age, but it's a gamble. Made in a particular style of extreme ripeness, the wine features blackberries, currants, red licorice and spices, and is fully dry."
Pinot Noir,"Despite showing dusty plum and cherry aromas, this comes across lean on the bouquet, a defining characteristic that's confirmed on the palate via zesty, crisp acids and raw, tangy, herbal red-fruit flavors. A dry finish turns hot, an appropriate ending to this tightly wound Pinot Noir."
Pinot Noir,"Young and forward, this pleasant wine brings black-cherry fruit front and center—a good start, but it doesn't really develop any further. It just does a quick and quiet fade out."
Pinot Noir,"Smooth and rich, the first release of the new vintage from Le Cadeau is a gem. Tangy berry/cherry fruit is framed in chocolate, while balancing acidity props up softer, caramel streaks. The finish brings a wash of citrus, leaving the mouth feeling clean and ready to sip again."
Pinot Noir,"While this vineyard is close by the Russian River and is not considered the best of Rochioli's vineyards, winemaker Bob Cabral consistently makes its grapes into one of Williams Selyem's most compelling wines. This shows the impeccable tannins and acids of Rochioli fruit, with sweet, ripe, deep flavors of cherry and spice. Notes of pomegranate, rum punch, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood add complexity. Beautiful to drink now, it should continue to develop for at least 10 years."
Pinot Noir,"When first opened it is tight and herbal, with the scent of blood. But the subtle hints of rock and spice that underlie the pristine cranberry fruit need some years to unwrap themselves. This new 2006 Schindler comes out swinging, its wild berry fruit laced with earthy, barnyard funk. Tastes like an unbridled mix of fruit and soil, spice and barrel, that adds up to a vibrant, earthy, alive Pinot."
Pinot Noir,"From the extreme wilds near Annapolis, this vineyard-designate is rapaciously earthy in all the right ways, a taste of its environs, sauvage and demanding. Dark cherry and blueberry exude on the nose and follow through on the palate, in between jolts of baking spice and dried herb. Medium bodied, the wine is on the money right now, but should also do well in the bottle for years to come."
Pinot Noir,"It's somewhat odd to find a reserve-level Pinot Noir done entirely in neutral oak, but here it is. Pretty cherry fruit comes wrapped in tart acids. The tannins are light and suggest drinking this now rather than aging it further."
Pinot Noir,"Produced from old vines on the Bourgeois estate, this wood-aged wine certainly shows its toastiness although it also has plenty of red-berry flavors as a balance. It is richly concentrated, a good example of the richer, more serious style of Pinot Noir that is coming from Sancerre. It is structured and can age, so drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,"Attractively perfumed, this rich wine offers some dark tannins as well as forward black-currant fruits. The wood aging is still showing in the burnt toastiness of the wine, although this will diminish, leaving a broad wine packed with fruit. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"This is a solid Pinot, ripe in raspberries and cherries, with fine coastal acidity and firm tannins. It has a silky mouthfeel the way Pinot Noir should."
Pinot Noir,"A 100% varietal wine fermented in stainless steel, this is a bright, lively tangle of cherry and orange built around bristling acidity that practically sizzles on the palate. Light-bodied and plenty crisp, it mellows to show length and breadth on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Union Wine Company, which now owns Amity, makes a number of good-value, well-structured Pinots. Add this one to the list. Aged 11 months in 15% new French oak, it's pleasingly fruity (raspberry and cherry) but doesn't stop there. The touch of barrel-aging adds coffee and caramel highlights."
Pinot Noir,"This opens with a full and succulent burst of fruit, notably cherries and plums. The rich and juicy flavors are highlighted with a streak of cola and buoyed with ample acids. This is just flat-out delicious."
Pinot Noir,"With the dominance of Pinot Noir in the Aube region, it is no surprise to find a vintage Champagne that is 100% from that grape. With a round character from the Pinot, as well as a hot vintage, this is a full-bodied wine with vibrant fruit and lively acidity. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"On the sharp and lean side, showing sour red cherry candy, wintergreen and green peppercorn flavors, fattened with sweet oak. Dry and elegant, but not very rich. Drink up."
Pinot Noir,"Tar and rich black cherries form the nose of this wine sourced from a vineyard planted in 1997. Luscious red fruit begins the palate, supported in the midpalate and finish by black pepper and fennel seed. It makes for a very approachable but complex, spice-driven wine."
Pinot Noir,"Still tightly wound, this brings cranberry and raspberry fruit front and center. There's a hint of yeasty bread dough also, and the wine seems to still be emerging from its raw youth. Let it breathe, and a nice streak of deep, dark chocolate fills in the finish."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is smoky with hints of wood. The red-plum fruits are a little suppressed at the moment although the acidity and freshness hint at a good future. It has a cool character with plenty of acidity under the tannins. It will develop, but slowly. Drink from 2020."
Pinot Noir,"Deliciously ripe in raspberries, cherries and plums, with an exotic coating of sweetly caramelized oak. The texture is fine and silky, but ultimately the wine is too sweet and simple."
Pinot Noir,"With brisk acidity, a bone-dry finish and some dusty tannins, this is an interesting Pinot Noir, with a silky texture and cherry jam, pomegranate and cranberry flavors that are ready to drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Fragrant and soft, this wine carries a gentle floral fragrance—crushed roses—into a midpalate of bright raspberry and cherry. It turns a little leathery in the mouth, astringent but with the cherry flavors persisting, suggesting that further bottle age will soften it and add more textural complexity."
Pinot Noir,"A splendid, near-perfect Pinot, although it's very young and will benefit from time in the bottle. Few Pinots offer richer, more massive flavors. Just explodes on the palate with raspberries, cherries, persimmons, Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and cinnamon spices, yet the tannin-acid structure keeps it all balanced. A joy to drink as it warms and changes in the glass. Now–2014."
Pinot Noir,"This selection is from the winery's first planted vineyard, now nearing 20 years of age. It's all Pommard clone, offering a burst of pretty cherry fruit backed with stiff tannins and a streak of iron. Still showing some sharp edges, it's just out of 15 months in 50% new oak, and will benefit from aerating or further bottle age."
Pinot Noir,"From vineyards close to the winery in Chevannes, this wine is ripe and fruity. It has attractive acidity, recalling the freshness of the vintage, and tannins that hold it together, providing a firm background. Drink from late 2017."
Pinot Noir,"If you know Elqui, than this funky wine's murky, stewy, muddy aromas won't come as a shock. In the mouth, this is soft and mushy, with little to no noticeable acidity. Flavors of burnt leaves and stalky berry fruits offer minimal punch, while the finish tastes stewy and rooty, which is nothing unusual for northerly Elqui."
Pinot Noir,"Like the winery's 2008 Pinot, this new 2009 is tart. Its acidity cuts right through the rich, ripe cherry and raspberry fruit, giving the wine a sour candy taste. Everything else about it is great."
Pinot Noir,"From a walled vineyard once owned by the local bishop, this wine is structured and firm while also having great red cherry and berry fruit. It's one of a number of Premier Crus from this producer—and certainly the most expressive with its generous fruit and balanced tannins. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"Textbook RRV Pinot Noir, a red wine for Cab and Merlot lovers who want to graduate to this great grape. Dry and full-bodied, it actually has some pronounced tannins, with currant and bitter cherry skin flavors and darker, complex notes of pine sap, balsamic and black pepper."
Pinot Noir,"Candied red and purple fruit meets mocha and cola spice on the nose of this bottling, which is approachable and simple. The palate is tart with cranberry and plum skin flavors, lifted by dried ginger spice."
Pinot Noir,"Cool, leafy, earthy aromas are low on fruit and freshness. This is a tannic wine with leafy, candied berry flavors and then a heavy blast of burnt caramel and toast. Charred and fruitless on the finish, this is more oaky than anything."
Pinot Noir,"This is a light- to medium-bodied wine with a soft, silky texture. Cherries, mushrooms and just the smallest of herbal nuances end on a faintly dusty note. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Just two barrels were made, from the vineyard's 1972-era planting. This all-Pommard clone selection delivers extra nuances of leaf and bramble to a wine of medium density. The strawberry/cherry preserve fruit flavors are concentrated and rich, and the time in French oak has brought light flavors of caramel, chocolate and toasted hazelnuts into the finish."
Pinot Noir,"A structured wine, packed with red fruits and delightful acidity. There is a core of dark tannin and a solid structure as well as the bright freshness at the end. Because it has this structure, it's worth aging for 4–5 years."
Pinot Noir,"A touch of earthy funk shows at first on the nose of this bottling, laced throughout the dark cranberry, pomegranate, crushed grapeseeds and a lavish layer of violets. The palate is heavily spiced with clove, gingerbread, a touch of juniper, lots of earthy sagebrush and a strong cranberry fruit, all seasoned by an iron-powered minerality."
Pinot Noir,"Not much going on with this simple but drinkable Pinot Noir. It's light in body and softly crisp, with slightly sweet cherry pie and sweet oak flavors."
Pinot Noir,"It is not clear while a simple appellation Bourgogne should need a wax capsule and heavy bottle. It all makes it that much harder to get to the warm ripe wine inside. With its strawberry fruit that is laced with acidity, the wine is generous, reveling in the fine 2015 vintage. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"Redhawk makes a value-priced lineup of Pinots, and in 2009 it is the two least expensive that have the most varietal character and charm. Concentrated cherry candy fruit builds depth and interest with a wash of mint and menthol. It's full-bodied and mouth-filling, and the flavors linger a long time."
Pinot Noir,"Here is a well-focused wine with appealing toastiness as soon as it's opened. Fruit flavors are still tight, but unfold into tangy raspberry. It spent 18 months in half new French oak, to good effect."
Pinot Noir,"Three-quarters of this wine was whole-cluster fermented, and spent 18 months in one-third new oak. Blending the winery's three best barrels of the vintage, it's a spicy, edgy wine which marries bitter herbs to black cherry and chocolate components. Firm and muscular, young and powerful, it should be cellared for a few years. Drink 2020–2025."
Pinot Noir,"Red in color, with grassy aromas of clover and cherry. The palate runs soft and a little cloying, with sweet, flat, grassy flavors of plum and cherry. Candied and a bit dull on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Simple and sweet, showing cherry pie filling and cola flavors. The mouthfeel is soft, lacking vitality. An okay Pinot, but nothing special."
Pinot Noir,"From the heart of Pinot Noir country, this iconic vineyard, originally planted in the 1970s, yields concentrated flavors of black cherry, root beer, incense and peppermint. Tart, juicy and quite young, this finishes with leaf and herb-infused tannins."
Pinot Noir,"The first release annually from the estate vineyard, this is a solid effort, seemingly infused with scents and flavors of pine needle, pine tar, earth and bark. The fruit is in the background, and leans toward cranberry and brambly blackberry."
Pinot Noir,"This upper-tier label shows condensed strawberry fruit against an herbal backbone of marjoram, black cardamom, rainbow peppercorns, dried tobacco and green olive. The palate is tangy with woody fruits of elderberry and juniper, likely to thrive with age."
Pinot Noir,"This is still a young wine, with its ripe red fruits and black cherry flavors. The taste of licorice mingles with the fruit and balances with the smoky toast flavors. It's a rich wine that needs time, so drink from 2016."
Pinot Noir,"A balanced, ripe wine, this offers a good contrast between the dusty tannins and bright red-berry fruits. It's ready to drink with its fruitiness, although it will develop a richer, fuller character as it ages over the next year. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,"This is an excellent appellation blend, starting with a slightly sweet nose of concentrated grenadine, carnations and wild herbs. The sip dries up considerably, with lots of eucalyptus showing at first and then a strong candied raspberry flavor riding the herbs and a strong acidity. Strawberry arises into the finish."
Pinot Noir,This light-colored and easy-drinking wine offers bright cherry and tea aromas followed by raspberry/cranberry flavors on a crisp texture with good acidity and moderate tannins. It shows the leaner side of Pinot.
Pinot Noir,"Bright but tart cherry and blackberry flavors are swathed in dusty tannins; the nose offers similar berry and plum aromas. It's a little acidic, but finishes with nice dusty-plum flavors."
Pinot Noir,"Leafy raspberry aromas are offset by cured-meat notes of sausage or ballpark hot dogs. This has a creamy yet flabby mouthfeel with barely detectable acidity. Baked cherry and raspberry flavors show touches of cinnamon and chocolate, while the finish is dull."
Pinot Noir,"Fine, elegant wine, packed with delicious strawberry flavors, sweetness and richness. At the core are firm tannins, but these are almost crowded out by the ripe fruit."
Pinot Noir,"The cool 2011 vintage has kept this bottling from being as ripe as previous wines from this producer. It's certainly leaner, but for all that, it's dry, silky and elegantly complex in its own way, with dried raspberry, tea and white pepper flavors. It could surprise after 2017."
Pinot Noir,"Red cherry, vanilla, chaparral scrub and cranberry puree show on the nose of this bottling from the longtime estate, and then come the intriguing olive and Middle Eastern spices. The palate hones in on that Mediterranean spice character, with Kalamata olives blending into lavender, exotic mulberry and thyme-laced cherry-plum sauce."
Pinot Noir,"A rooty style of warm-climate Pinot with sarsparilla, tomato leaf, beet and black cherry on what is a hot, slightly fiery nose. The palate is juicy, with cola, sweet cherry, herb and stemmy flavors, while the finish is snappy, with an aftertaste of caramel and berry liqueur. From vines planted in 1968."
Pinot Noir,"Riddle is in Green Valley, on a high ridge prone to morning fog. This resulting effort showcases a sizzling, mouthwatering basket of wild strawberry, cherry and vanilla tea, managing to be plush, lush and elegant simultaneously. Juicy and pleasurable, it's immediately enjoyable, silky and the right kind of rich."
Pinot Noir,"The nose is subdued, with aromas of crisp red plum, herb and bramble; but the palate is lush, with loads of ripe strawberry, peach and cherry flavors. This is dry in style but soft and juicy on the palate."
Pinot Noir,"Too sharp, with a bite of acidity and green tannins, but otherwise a decent introductory wine for learning about Pinot Noir's charms. It's dry and silky, with red cherry flavors."
Pinot Noir,"Flavors roll from cranberry to sweet red cherry in a red-fruit riot. It was aged in 52% new and 24% one-year-old oak, but it's unobtrusive and not especially toasty. The barrel time has begun to smooth out any bumps and rough edges, though a touch of phenolic bite remains. Drink from 2018 to 2022."
Pinot Noir,"One of South Africa's premier Pinot Noir producers, Hamilton Russell offers a 2007 Pinot that marries earthy and primal with poised and balanced. The nose exhibits black cherry, clove and anise, and on the palate, savory, rich fruit is balanced by a racy backbone and plucky spices. Elegant and intriguing."
Pinot Noir,"Spicy strawberry and cherry hover over forest floor and a tangle of tangy acidity that keeps this wine fresh and vibrantly compelling. Full bodied and robust, it maintains a balance in the glass, making it both food-friendly and an option on its own."
Pinot Noir,"Floral and aromatic, this wine is the opposite of the typical tannic Nuits-St.-Georges. It is lively, with vibrant red fruits, great rich black cherry flavors, with a light layer of tannin providing structure."
Pinot Noir,"This is intense and muscular without being overdone. Herbal and peppery notes bring nuance to the concentrated flavors of dark plum, mocha and baking spice. The finish is richly tannic but not hard, making it approachable now but capable of aging through 2030."
Pinot Noir,"This is a great effort by winemaker Etienne Terlinden, offering dense and deep but bright and lively blackberry, black cherry, cola, graphite and a touch of wild herbs on the nose. Long-lasting flavors of sarsaparilla, shaved licorice, vanilla bean, bay leaf, fennel seed and dark earth meet with more black cherry fruit on the palate, carried by an expert acidity level."
Pinot Noir,"The strawberry fruit shows a wild herbal side, with a touch of toasted grain. The tannins are firm and the finish carries a hint of chicken broth."
Pinot Noir,"Plenty of rich, forward raspberry and cherry pie filling flavors in this Pinot, which shows a delicate, silky mouthfeel. With crisp acidity and a spicy finish, it's easy to drink now with burgers and grilled salmon."
Pinot Noir,"This wine's distinct and intriguing nose pairs cola and cinnamon with cranberry, chopped chaparral scrub and wildfire smoke. That scrubby character of green sage and mugwort extends to the palate, spicing up the beet juice, ripe raspberries and a pencil-lead backbone."
Pinot Noir,"Grassy aromas send you toward a lean and gappy-feeling palate with rudimentary cherry and plum flavors blended with medicinal, green undertones. Turns more green on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is restrained on the nose and initially on the palate, showing a touch of reduction and tightly-held flavor. As it opens, it unleashes juicy dark cherry, berry and huckleberry notes, its core dense with tannin and oak."
Pinot Noir,"This has acidity and tannins that are rich and complex. The raspberry, cola and licorice flavors have a nice coating of smoky oak."
Pinot Noir,Nice wine—if you're a beaver. Dry cedar and toast overwhelms the modest fruit.
Pinot Noir,"This is rich, showing the full-bodied character of a Gevrey-Chambertin Premier Cru. It has a sense of gravity and structure, with a flavor of red-plum jelly. Solid and chunky, this already expresses its fruit, although it does need at least six years to mature."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is structured, dark and dense, with great swathes of smoky tannins plus plenty of red-fruit flavors. With its concentration, structure and richness, the wine will develop well and powerfully. Drink from 2021."
Pinot Noir,"Bow Tie is planted to a variety of clones, including Swan and Rochioli. It is one of the winery's newest vineyard sources and this vintage is the first of its vineyard-designated wines from the site. Floral in anise, plum and raspberry, it is medium-bodied with a background of oak that picks up on the finish, offering seasonings of caramel and chocolate."
Pinot Noir,"This is well-made in a classic Oregon mold, which is to say, putting plenty of herbal highlights into the mix. There are light red fruits in abundance as well, and the flavors meld well through a medium-long finish."
Pinot Noir,"This Pinot is consistent with the winery's previous bottlings over the years. It's a solid wine, with gentle tannins and tart acidity framing cranberry, cola and herb flavors. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Black cherry and blueberry fruit show on the dense, dark nose of this bottling, alongside clove, allspice, nutmeg, purple flower, crushed rosebuds and dust. Black and red plums show on the sip, as does chipped asphalt, charcoal and coffee. It's a standout in terms of darkness for a Pinot Noir."
Pinot Noir,"If you had the resources to analyze what makes a picture postcard-perfect Russian River Pinot Noir, and then to actually produce it in case quantities, this is what you'd come up with. The wine is dry and silky and crisply acidic, with pleasant cherry, root beer and spice flavors. It's as friendly as can be and fully ready now."
Pinot Noir,"Another successful 2011 from this winery, in fact the best of their six new Pinots. Shows the brilliant acidity and light, delicate texture of the coast, with the concentrated fruit, cola and spice flavors this esteemed vineyard is noted for. Highly complex and dry, it's delicious to drink now, and should age well for a good six years."
Pinot Noir,"A pale shadow of richer Russian River Pinot, but with plenty of flavor and appellation character. Sort of an introductory  Pinot, with pretty cola and cherry flavors and silky tannins. Snaps to a quick finish."
Pinot Noir,"From a section of the producer's Quail Hill Vineyard, this wine sings with smoky sage and forest floor notes, its tingling acidity emphasizing freshness. Its backbone of thick tannins offers strength and power, contrasting more delicate layers of blueberry flavor."
Pinot Noir,"This bright, focused wine with tense acidity blends fruit from five vineyards across the appellation. Silky tannins enwrap its nuanced dark cherry and wild strawberry flavors tinged with earth."
Pinot Noir,"Scratchy, dry raspberry aromas are standard and accurate for Pinot. The mouthfeel is tight and crisp, with gentle acids pushing standard strawberry, raspberry and oaky flavors of cocoa and spice. Mild tasting but long on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Biodynamically farmed, this young vineyard seems to improve with each new vintage. More and more you find an expression of soil details—delicate streaks of dried leaf, moist loam, a flavor of clay. The fruit is refined and perfectly ripe, without being fleshy. An elegant style, cellar-worthy but delicious already."
Pinot Noir,"Interesting components of rural earth, mushroom, plum, dark cherry and cola spice play off each other in this robust, full-bodied Pinot, from the growers of Toboni Vineyards."
Pinot Noir,"Good concentration, which gives the fruit more plum and black cherry than red raspberry. It's deep and sinuous, with threads of graphite and smoke, but the fruit is the star here, and the wine has the concentration and acidity to cellar well for a decade or more."
Pinot Noir,"The style at Martinborough Vineyards has always been geared toward aging, and this 2011 is still remarkably fresh. Floral and cherry notes lead the way, backed by tart acids and firm tannins. Worth stashing away until 2018."
Pinot Noir,"Produced from old vines in the Aegerter Domaine, this wine is dominated by red fruits and spice from wood aging. It is fruity, perfumed and likely to be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"This is a blend of several marquee vineyards, including Gap's Crown, Martinelli and Widdoes. It comes together nicely in a mix of fig and baked bread, peppered in baking spices and dried herb. Cherry comes through along with subtle hints of violet and rose, before a long, lingering finish ties things in a juicy bow at the end."
Pinot Noir,"Thin, dilute, with a minty, unripe character, and hard-as-nails tannins."
Pinot Noir,"Ripeness marks this Pinot. It floods the mouth with jammy raspberries and cherries, brightened with acidity. Seems a bit straightforward by virtue of sheer dazzle, but it is a superb example of the Santa Rita Hills, at a good price."
Pinot Noir,"Rugged scents of wild berries and forest woods blend into intriguing aromas on this wine from the highest Pinot Noir vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains. It unleashes a rainbow of flavors, from acai and red fruit to rum cake and brown spices to mocha, tea, tobacco and Dr. Pepper."
Pinot Noir,"Here is the most engaging offering of the winery's 2013 single vineyard Pinots. It's bright with red-berry fruit and tropical-candy highlights. Meyer lemon peeks in, and the tangy fruit flavors continue into a finish of medium weight and length. Drink now and over the next couple of years."
Pinot Noir,"A Pinot in the ultralight style. There’s cranberry and tea qualities, and an almost weightless mouthfeel. No new oak renders it clean and fruity, with plenty of fresh-berry essence. In the end, it’s a lightweight that closes with licorice and anise notes."
Pinot Noir,"Give this lovely Pinot Noir a few hours in the decanter and serve now with your best lamb and steak entrées. It's dry, refined in the acid-tannin balance and deliciously complex, with waves of raspberries and cherries, pie crust, baking spices and toasted oak."
Pinot Noir,"This firm, well-crafted wine reflects the lightness of the vintage. Raspberry, citrus and stone components come across in a balanced effort that should continue to drink well until 2020."
Pinot Noir,"From a vineyard planted in 1988, this bottling offers aromas of lavender and sweet incense, with a woody spice uplifting the exotic plum and mulberry fruits. Ripe wild berries meet with elderflower and lilac on the very perfumed palate."
Pinot Noir,"This is a bigger, more forceful wine than its Lindemans stablemate, but not quite as charming. The flavors are earthy and dark, featuring hints of cola and root beer. Finishes with drying tannins. —J.C."
Pinot Noir,"Sometimes a blend of vineyards like this one can equal or surpass the single-vineyard bottlings. This complex and well-rounded wine achieves a good balance between seductive fruit flavors and more subtle, woodsy, savory nuances from whole-cluster fermentation, while not going over-the-top in body or oakiness. Each sip uncovers more spice, more cedar and more subtlety."
Pinot Noir,"This is a light-colored wine, with structure and acidity to balance the perfumed cherry-flavored fruit. Still young, still developing its fruitiness, the wine is going to be crisp with attractive strawberry flavors and soft tannins. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,"This full-bodied wine demonstrates the jammy side of Volnay. It is rich and dense, and it has a delicious berry flavor. In the process of all this generosity, the tannins are lost, so drink it over the next few years."
Pinot Noir,"Light in weight and lacy in texture, this is a savory, subtly flavored Pinot Noir that's ready to drink. Notes of smoke, mushrooms and dried herbs intertwine with tart fruit."
Pinot Noir,"A rich, candied Pinot Noir, filled with raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors. It's a bit simple, but deliciously so, with a crisply silky texture."
Pinot Noir,Ripe luscious aromas of fleshy red plum and cherries turn a bit more demure on the palate of this Pinot Noir rosé. It's a full bodied wine with yielding acidity and pleasant heft on the palate. A touch of minerality lends elegance to the finish.
Pinot Noir,A bit of charred wood and black pepper in the aroma give way to lush berry and cherry flavors that spread across the palate and cling to the sides of the mouth. This wine is lightly oaky and has an attractive richness that lasts on the finish.
Pinot Noir,"This is a limited (two barrels) bottling from a Dundee Hills vineyard. Tight red currant fruit is streaked with licorice and baking chocolate. There's plenty of acid, not entirely integrated into the fruit, and a hint of caramel in the finish. Good components, though not yet a complete and seamless wine."
Pinot Noir,"Five vineyards contribute their best barrels to this outstanding blend, which carries the humble Oregon AVA on its label. It's a testament to the art of blending, as most of the components are also featured in vineyard designates, but here the whole is more than the sum of its parts. It's a showcase of pure, dense, detailed red fruits, set in perfectly matched acid, tannin and mineral elements."
Pinot Noir,"Although this has a rustic edge, this is an attractive, ripe and red-fruited wine. It has a rich, jammy quality that combines with the dry tannins. The finish is dense and firm. Enjoy this now, or wait for three years."
Pinot Noir,"Meant to impart the meaning of the “true” Sonoma Coast, this bottling hails from Campbell Ranch near Annapolis. It impresses with its lush complexity: cherry grenadine and forest floor scents, with cardamom spice and a hint of orange peel. It's full-bodied and densely powerful."
Pinot Noir,"This is sourced from 1970s-era vines. It's an almost ethereal weave of berry, saffron, mint, cola and tea, all wreathed in light smoke. It shows lovely complexity for such a young wine, and it's got the balance and structure to age nicely. Drink now through 2025."
Pinot Noir,"The fascinating nose of this wine is reason enough to seek it out—an aromatic display of underripe raspberry, tart pomegranate, fresh dill, eucalyptus and sage. Montmorency cherry notes show on the palate, along with mace, Vietnamese cinnamon and fennel. A unique, refreshing and memorable wine."
Pinot Noir,"This wine's incredibly distinct nose of pure fruit shows plump raspberries alongside delicate grapeseed, a pinch of baking spice and a whiff of yeast. Though the wine is light in color and frame, the palate shows lots of earth, tobacco smoke, cherry pits, bouquet garni and rosemary, with refreshing wild berry fruit."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is dense, although you hardly notice the tannins for the weight of concentrated fruit. The tannins are there, though, a power to thrust this immense wine well into the future. It is well formed, firm while rich. Drink from 2024."
Pinot Noir,"Starts out very full-bodied and rich, almost too heavy for Pinot Noir. Then the acids kick in to accent the silky texture, and you know it's a ripe, ageable Pinot Noir. With deep flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, cocoa and peppery spices, it should develop well over the next 4–6 years."
Pinot Noir,"This bottling of the 667 and Pommard clones starts with a stewed-cherry note before the sagebrush, forest floor and moss aromas start to dominate. There's an exotic sesame touch to the sip, where cherry and berry flavors are lifted by savory hints of salt, pepper and nori wrap. Really unique and delicious, it leaves the mouth watering and invigorated."
Pinot Noir,"Made by an Oregon winery from Carneros region grapes, this wine tastes mellow and mature. It has a relatively light color with an auburn rim, aromas that are savory and meaty, flavors like rhubarb and beef, a fairly crisp balance and smooth texture."
Pinot Noir,"A seductive, downright sexy wine, this opens with scents of dried cherries and sandalwood. Those cherry flavors expand inside a frame of dark chocolate. Tannins have a bit of a shell, but ample aeration takes the stiffness out."
Pinot Noir,"In its second vintage, this wine is light and spicy, clearly made to be enjoyed with food. A collaborative effort between winemaker Guy Davis and proprietor/grapegrower and chef Guy Fieri, it shines in subtly toasty oak, cinnamon and dark cherry flavors, with a lingering lushness on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Wet slate, cinnamon and allspice notes meet with red cherry, baked black cherry and bramble on the nose of this bottling from a popular single-vineyard source. Clay and chalky earth notes show on the palate, which is very full and rich with tart cherry, black plum and pencil-lead flavors."
Pinot Noir,"Light and easy, and made for drinking now. Shows plenty of charm, with dry, crisp flavors of herbs, red currants, tobacco and spices, wrapped into scoury tannins."
Pinot Noir,"For those wondering what minerality means in a red wine, this bottling is the answer. Against the black cherry and dark strawberry on the nose rise powerful crushed slate and smashed graphite aromas. The palate starts with cranberry and pomegranate, but the slate and rocky-soil flavors swing back in, giving backbone to the hints of bay leaf and herbs."
Pinot Noir,"This is a sort of junior version of Swan's awesome Trenton Estate Pinot. It shows the same dryness and acidity, with appealing flavors of cherries, raspberries and mushrooms. It's not quite as dense and complex, but it's a gorgeously silky Pinot Noir."
Pinot Noir,"A huge Pinot Noir, superripe and exotic in raspberry and cherry jam, persimmon, cola, cinnamon, clove and sandalwood flavors. Defines the Sonoma Coast, with a crisp spine of acidity providing bright structure. Bold now, all fruit and oak, but has the balance to develop bottle nuance through 2015, at the very least."
Pinot Noir,"Zippy acidity balances soft sour-cherry and rustic earth tones on Millbrook's standard-label Pinot Noir. It's an elegantly subdued wine, with soft, gentle tannins and a hint of green herb that linger on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Juicy on the palate with ample black cherry and Damson plum flavors, this is an easy-drinking Pinot Noir with just the faintest whisper of tannins. Hints of bramble and wet earth add dimension."
Pinot Noir,"Concentrated cherry and plum aromas meet with iron, cinnamon and gingersnap on the nose of this single-vineyard wine. The flavors surpass the aromas in succulence—star anise, nutmeg and bay leaf seemingly wrapped in buttered pastry."
Pinot Noir,"Named for the soil layers important to wine's terroir, this Pinot is sourced from a variety of sites and multiple clones, providing a complexity of wild strawberry, high acidity and an herbaceous, oaky backdrop. A teasing kiss of toffee and chocolate on the finish is deliciously intriguing."
Pinot Noir,"The 30-year-old vines at Canary Hill seem to have ripened well at lower brix, yielding a full-flavored, forward wine with lovely plum and cherry fruit. There also are pleasing details of leaf and cured meat, in a wine that keeps on giving the more you look."
Pinot Noir,"Cherry and clove star in this vineyard-designate from a good vintage, in which the producer again aims low in terms of ripeness. It makes for a somewhat one-dimensional experience once the initial aromas and bite of flavor dissipate on the palate."
Pinot Noir,"The appellation is good at producing soft early drinking wines like this. It is fruity with good acidity and red-currant fruitiness. The tannins are in the background, allowing the wine to age for a few years. Drink this ripe wine from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"This small production (200 cases) Pinot Noir is a mix of older and younger estate vines, a selection of lots given 22 months in 60 and 132 gallon French oak casks. It's still tasting quite young, sharp and chewy, with spicy fruit backed up against earthy tannins. Give it plenty of breathing time."
Pinot Noir,"A very rich Pinot Noir, this tastes almost as heavy as pie filling. It's delicious, tasting of brown sugar, ripe black cherry and pie spice, with a buttery toast note from oak barrels. It's a little soft, so drink up."
Pinot Noir,"This wine, which shows a touch of age, offers heady aromas of damp morel mushrooms, dried seaweed, a soy-like umami, iodine and beef jerky. It's meaty on the palate, with tart cranberry and dried orange rind flavors, lifted with hints of violets, lavender and pepper."
Pinot Noir,"Finely perfumed, with berry fruits that freshen the more severe tannins. The wine has concentrated structure, smokiness as well as fresh acidity. The finish is dry and firm."
Pinot Noir,"Light aromas of tea, briary raspberry and field notes are mild as a whole. Feels juicy, lean and transparent, with agile dry-fruit flavors, cocoa and modest buttery oak. Light in weight and tasting on the tail end."
Pinot Noir,"The Pinot-ness of this wine is undeniable: its structure is of velvet, and its aromas convey freshly turned earth, autumnal oak leaf and subdued red-cherry fruit. There is a depth that evokes deep forests. Have this with furred or feathered game."
Pinot Noir,"This wine captures the essence of Swan's 2010 Pinot Noirs. It shows the effects of the cool vintage, and it bears an earthy, mushroomy inflection to the plummy and cherry-like flavors."
Pinot Noir,"Elegance is the keyword for all the wines of DDO, with the added bonus of structure that almost begs for cellaring. This lovely Pinot Noir effortlessly captures the essence of the grape without any heavy-handed oak, alcohol or over-ripeness. Truly Burgundian, a moderate 14% alcohol, it offers seamless integration of berry and plum fruit, natural acids and lightly applied oak accents of sandalwood and toasted cracker."
Pinot Noir,"Despite the bold statement of this rosé's cat-shaped bottle, it is fairly subdued, suggesting more mineral tones than fruit. It's brisk and lemony though, with a refreshingly clean finish."
Pinot Noir,"An oaky, concentrated wine, this is briary in robust black and blue fruit that offers a smidgen of black tea. Tannic, this is a powerful wine from a powerful vintage, exuding much of the appellation's earthy signature."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is sourced from grapes grown in an organic estate vineyard in the heart of the Green Valley. Flavors of raspberries and pomegranates are delicious, and new French oak marries seamlessly with the fruit. Vibrant coastal acidity makes everything sing. If there's an off note, it's a mushroom and veggie note, courtesy of the cold vintage. The wine is already softening in tannins so drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Stewed black plum and tangy black cherry fruit meet baking spice and cola on the nose of this bottling from Lompoc-based Brian Loring. The palate is tangy with black cherry and cranberry, with a touch of herbs and forest floor."
Pinot Noir,"Light raspberry fruit carries a suggestion of clean earth and dried herb. The tannins show some substantial grip. The overall balance is fine, though the wine drinks younger than most 2012s. Best after 2020."
Pinot Noir,"Produced from the oldest Pinot Noir vines in the Willamette Valley, this extraordinary wine is history in a bottle. Glorious aromatics offer intense scents of citrus, pine needle, pepper and berry, with flavors following. There's a welcome kick of citrus in the natural acidity, and this promises a long cellar life, as proven over and over again by this founding Oregon winery. Drink 2020 through 2040 and beyond."
Pinot Noir,"This lovely, evocative wine celebrates the finesse that characterizes the finest Pinot Noirs. Delicate nuances of bramble, cinnamon, tar and nougat wrap around and weave through a core of black cherry fruit. Ample acidity ensures much life ahead, through at least 2025."
Pinot Noir,"This is a terrific representation of all that is spectacularly specific about Keefer Ranch, a relatively cool site for grapes in Green Valley. Earthy and spicy in clove and nutmeg, the wine is layered in cranberry and crisp cherry. It's supple and silky on the palate, with an earthy oomph to the finish."
Pinot Noir,"A soft, silky-textured Pinot Noir, this wine starts off with admirable complexity on the nose in the form of bacon, smoke, fresh greens and strawberries. Despite an overall lack of punch, it's easy to drink and offers decent value in Pinot Noir. Imported by AUSA Pacific, LLC."
Pinot Noir,"Raspberry and clove characterize the nose on this single-vineyard bottling. The palate kicks off with vibrant black cherry, slips toward black olive on the midpalate and ends with bright acidity on a decent finish."
Pinot Noir,"This is edgy and lean, with mulch and latex on a stripped back nose. In the mouth, it clangs around due to racy acidity. Flavors of leafy red fruits and citrus are not fully convincing."
Pinot Noir,"A very tight, tart and tannic Pinot Noir, almost impossible to open up despite hours of breathing. Acidic and unyielding, the rating is a compromise between what it is currently showing and what it hints at if you probe deeply enough."
Pinot Noir,"Stewed black plum and tangy black cherry fruit meet baking spice and cola on the nose of this bottling from Lompoc-based Brian Loring. The palate is tangy with black cherry and cranberry, with a touch of herbs and forest floor."
Pinot Noir,"The winery's single-vineyard 2011 Pinots varied widely in this erratic vintage. Dry and tart, the wine is marked by a vegetal streak that cuts through the raspberries and cherries."
Pinot Noir,"Winemaker Kim Crawford has crafted a dark, full-bodied Pinot Noir that could use another year or two of bottle age. The nose is slightly meaty and bacony, while the palate delivers dark flavors of black cherries, plums, cola and baking spices before turning firm on the finish. Drink 2018–2025."
Pinot Noir,"This is a memorably refreshing and reasonably complex effort, a crisp, delicious mix of tangerine, grapefruit and fresh strawberry made by the saignée method. Meaty, with texture, it's round, balanced and dry. Stock up."
Pinot Noir,"This wine from the Palos Verdes coastline is redolent with sagebrush, crushed anise and alpine strawberries on the herbally aromatic nose. The sage also powers the palate, alongside juniper and pine, all set against a wild berry frame. This is a big Pinot, though it is relatively light in structure and happily reliant on savory herbs rather than overly ripe fruits."
Pinot Noir,"Well balanced and moderately flavorful, this wine feels quenching and appetizing at the same time but needs time to round off its rough edges. It's not overwhelmingly fruity or oaky, but has compact, concentrated red cherry and rhubarb and a good firm grip of tannin and fruit acidity. It will be best after 2019."
Pinot Noir,"A gentle, easy Pinot, showing a finely dry, silky texture and ripe flavors of cherry and raspberry jam. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Sharp cinnamon and concentrated but light hibiscus and strawberry notes meet with an extreme menthol character on the nose of this bottling. That minty element explodes on the palate, where camphor and pine needle flavors overwhelm the strawberry fruit."
Pinot Noir,"Fairly light in the glass, this bottling shows sharp pomegranate aromas with a gunmetal edge and a touch of cracked-pepper spice. Pomegranate also arises on the palate as does orange rind, tart cherry and an intriguing potpourri and lavender element, altogether light and easy to drink."
Pinot Noir,"Light in color and silky in texture, this earthy wine offers overtones of cinnamon, dark cherry, raspberry and clove. Well integrated in terms of oak and tannin, it's full-bodied enough to please those who like a bigger styled wine."
Pinot Noir,"This new entry into the value-wine sweepstakes is a pretty rose color, offering clean, light scents of wild berry and milk chocolate. Flavors are gently spicy with a malty finish."
Pinot Noir,"Concentrated tannins balance this juicy red-berry flavor wine. The wine is still very young, showing its tannins strongly. They will certainly integrate. Drink this potentially rich wine from 2022."
Pinot Noir,"Perhaps the most forward and appealing wine in the lineup, the Vista Hills Pinot Noir brings round flavors of chocolate-covered cherries, hints at pepper and herb, then finished up with lots more chocolate. Though not as detailed as some of the other Panther Creek single-vineyard offerings, it has pleasure written all over it."
Pinot Noir,"This is smooth as silk—supple and soft, with pretty cherry fruit and highlights of cocoa powder and coffee grounds. It's a professionally built wine all the way, made for easy enjoyment, with satiny tannins and a touch of anise."
Pinot Noir,"Schug's regular Pinot, as opposed to their Heritage Reserve, is a dependably village-style expression of easy-drinking, cool-climate Pinot Noir. The '06, like previous vintages, shows a silky, delicate texture framing cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a smoky vanilla edge of oak."
Pinot Noir,"A very finely crafted Pinot Noir, although it's also very young and wants some time in the cellar. Combines great Highlands fruit power and tannic structure with a silky, delicate mouthfeel. Beautiful now for the elaborate raspberry and cherry flavors, elaborated with beautiful oak, but better after 2013."
Pinot Noir,"Dark-colored and deeply flavored, this full-bodied wine smells smoky and meaty, tastes savory, feels firm and appropriately tannic. Showing the more robust, hearty side of Pinot, it can be paired successfully with most opulent meat and fowl dishes."
Pinot Noir,"Acidity is the main thing you notice when you sip this bone-dry wine. Also the light body, like silk in the mouth. It's delicate in texture, yet potent in flavor, offering waves of raspberries, cherries, red currants and spicy cola. It's a fine wine, but really too young. Hold it until 2018, at least."
Pinot Noir,"Savory and structured, it has a supple layering of allspice that dances on the palate, with floral violet tones. Black cherry and earth make up the soul of this wine; it's both classy and hearty."
Pinot Noir,"This widely available and well-priced appellation blend shows dark aromas of black raspberry, elderberry, wet slate and crushed gravel on the nose. The wine makes a soft entry on the palate, where mulberry meets with Earl Grey tea and a pinch of anise."
Pinot Noir,"Fruity in a grapy, plummy way, this is a substantial wine with deceptively sweet undertones that finishes dry and with a slight tang of black tea."
Pinot Noir,"Aromas of pork au jus with mashed cranberry and pomegranate mesh expertly with sage spice, woody forest-floor notes, porcini mushrooms and a touch of juniper on the nose. The palate offers lots of juniper and anise spice atop a boysenberry core, with black slate and graphite minerality."
Pinot Noir,"From negociant Nicolas Potel's own vines, this wine is dense and smoky. It has spice and hints of licorice as well as rich red-cherry fruit. The tannins and the structure of the wine promise aging, so drink this concentrated wine from 2020."
Pinot Noir,"This dry-farmed property produces concentrated grapes. Particularly in this vintage, it offers burly, tannin-laced fruit with a tendency to brood. Soft and velvety on the palate, it veers into tangy, oaky and spicy finishing touches."
Pinot Noir,"Dark and structured, powered by smoky tannins and plum skin texture. The wine is just beginning, its weight an indication of good aging potential. It is firm and dense, the acidity providing an attractive final freshness."
Pinot Noir,"This starts out well, with soft, plummy fruit. It then turns a corner into an odd, lingering finish with residual flavors of sour fruit, plastic and gun metal."
Pinot Noir,"Veteran winemaker Larry McKenna says Te Rehua consistently shows the most ripeness of his various single-vineyard wines. In this vintage, that comes across as a slightly jammy midpalate filled with plums and blackberries. Upfront, there's a floral element, and on the finish, some dusty tannins. Try it once 2016 rolls around, and drink it through 2025."
Pinot Noir,"Subtle, spicy oak influences mingle beautifully with tasty Bing cherry and persimmon flavors in this medium to full bodied wine that has a silky texture, crisp balance and fine-grained tannins. Good balance and interesting complexity propel it more than fruit intensity."
Pinot Noir,"Distinctive and precise, this well-priced wine should have a place in your cellar. It captures the specific characteristics—terroir if you will—that distinguish the best Willamette Valley Pinot Noirs: highlights of cola and herb, refreshing minerality, a perfect balance of fruit, acid and tannin, and a riveting liveliness in the mouth. All this without any hint of new oak makes this a winemaking tour de force."
Pinot Noir,It's not clear what separates this from some of the other estate-grown cuvées. The thin strawberry fruit accompanies rather stemmy tannins and a green vegetal streak.
Pinot Noir,"Lots of zesty acidity in this wonderfully complex, exotic Pinot Noir, which comes from the true Sonoma Coast, in the Fort Ross area. It's explosive in wild summer raspberries and cherries, briary nettles, vanilla bean and spices, with a perfect coating of sweetly caramelized oak. Very pure and refined, and best enjoyed young."
Pinot Noir,"Leathery cherry aromas lead to a fresh medium-bodied palate. Flavors of spiced plum, cherry and herbal tomato finish with tea notes along with dry spice. Overall, this is balanced and succeeds by keeping things simple."
Pinot Noir,"Aggressive vanilla and tobacco flavors overtake the simple, light cherry fruit. The over-oaked impression continues into the finish, which leaves a bitter aftertaste."
Pinot Noir,"Showing classic Santa Lucia highlights of enormously ripe cherries, Asian spices and acidity, this wine flatters the palate with the sheer force of its fruit and new oak. It's a young, fresh, vibrant wine that's at its best now."
Pinot Noir,"Tasted in a flight with far more expensive wines, this Pinot stood proud. It's dry and richly complex, with the silk-and-satin texture you want. The flavors reward with cherries, cola, Canadian bacon, Indian spices and sandalwood. At this price, it's a steal."
Pinot Noir,"Formerly the deLancellotti vineyard, Silice brings fresh, supple flavors of bright raspberry and cherry fruit. A distinctive ashy stone note forms the bassline, holding the finish firm. It should benefit from another year of bottle age. Or give it a long decant to enjoy now."
Pinot Noir,"With scents reminiscent of an early morning hike through a foggy forest, it features aromas of cola, sassafras and a damp, earthen funk. It hits the palate with a medium body, delivering some violet florals at first and, with enough swishing, finishing on sanguine flavors of red meat."
Pinot Noir,"This is a very spicy, peppery wine, and while it's pretty good, it's rougher and more rustic than most of its peers in Anderson Valley. The cherry, cola and carob flavors are savory, but there's a quality to the tannins that's robust, to say the least. Could be a sleeper."
Pinot Noir,"This vintage of Mirabai is open and full-throttle fruity, with appealing cherry scents and flavors. It's a lovely, delicate shade of rose, with a floral component to the bouquet. It's a subtle, elegant wine that offers immediate enjoyment and the prospect of cellaring well through 2020 or longer."
Pinot Noir,"Rich aromas of boysenberry, cranberry, pipe tobacco and dark chocolate prepare the palate for flavors of cherry syrup and pomegranate. Soft but persistent tannins are apparent in the mouth, and the finish offers lingering flavors of dark chocolate and coffee."
Pinot Noir,"Presumably unfiltered, this wine is slightly cloudy, which leads to a nicely creamy mouthfeel. But first come aromas of blistered cherry tomatoes, fennel seeds and green olives, followed by flavors of soft strawberry, tart cranberry and a tongue-tantalizing finish of cracked peppercorn. Serve with roasted pork."
Pinot Noir,"Chunky cherry and earthy tea aromas lead to a supremely tannic and overbearing body, leaving a residue as it transitions to the finish. Flavors along the way include oak, vanilla, syrupy berry, plastic and creamy chocolate."
Pinot Noir,"Clean and classic aromas of dark-red fruit, from cherry to bramble, meet with candied rose petal and clove aromas on the nose of this appellation blend. The palate is led by allspice and dried mint, all packaged in a medium-bodied format."
Pinot Noir,"Fruit is the star of this wine. It's gigantic and forward in sweet raspberry and cherry flavors that taste wild, picked under a hot summer sun. Fortunately, there's a lot of acidity, and firm tannins provide additional structure. The finish is thoroughly dry. A bit in your face now, but could do interesting things over the years."
Pinot Noir,"Rubbery plum, tomato and spice aromas are modest. This has a standard but healthy mouthfeel and flavors of raspberry, herbs and spice. On the finish, this doesn't offer anything different than what's on the palate."
Pinot Noir,"This estate-grown Pinot is still pretty rough and chewy, with earthy tannins that are chalky and drying. The fruit leans toward cranberry, with some vanilla flavors threaded in."
Pinot Noir,"From old vines planted in a single vineyard, this is a spectacular red. It has the crisp acidity of the cool-climate Sancerre, but it also has the weight and ripeness of a fine Burgundy. The wood aging has left a spicy toasty edge to the beautiful cherry fruits and acidity. It could age for another year to be at its best. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,"Firm and structured, this is a solid wine that will take time to mature. The vineyard, backed by woods, is considered one of the top premier crus in Mercurey. Certainly, this wine with its solid tannins and wood flavors that are backed by acidity and red-berry fruits, is one with a serious future. Drink from 2021."
Pinot Noir,"A swell deal for lovers of rich Pinot Noir who can't afford single-vineyard pricing, this countywide blend packs rose petals, stewed red cherries, hibiscus punch, wet gravel, black plum and nutmeg on the nose. The palate is juicy with a wide array of berry and cherry fruit, boosted by gingerbread spice and dark clay minerality. It's ripe but layered."
Pinot Noir,"From one of the larger of the great grands crus of Vosne-Romanée and Flagey-Echézeaux, this is a dark, structured wine. It has power and juicy acidity that drive its black plum and berry fruit flavors. A dry core of tannins promises many years of maturing. Drink from 2026."
Pinot Noir,"With its attractive red-fruit flavors, this is a light, perfumed wine. It has spice, fine acidity and a smooth texture that is just lifted by tannins. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"This wine comes from the fourth-generation winemaking family behind Los Angeles' San Antonio Winery, which owns vineyards in Santa Lucia Highlands and Arroyo Seco. It offers aromas of smoked pork loin and wild berries and is peppery on the palate, with tart raspberry fruit and the driving sense of smoke throughout. The tannins are a bit firm right now, so wait until 2016 or so."
Pinot Noir,"This medium-bodied Pinot Noir shows tasty varietal characteristics such as complex aromas of tea, plums and forest floor, almost-sweet cherry flavors, refreshing acidity, moderate tannins and a lingering finish. It earns its points with charm rather than weight."
Pinot Noir,"his is representative of the Cupcake style—a Pinot that lush with raspberry and rhubarb flavors, but also decent acidity. Drink up."
Pinot Noir,"This sophisticated and compelling wine combines full body and a muscular texture with very tasty, solid fruit flavors. The balance between acidity, tannin and flavor is good, and the finish is tangy and lingering."
Pinot Noir,"Given its high-octane aroma of barrel and petrol, this Pinot is defined by its need to settle down, more disheveled teenager than the groomed adult it surely will become. The bones are there, dark berry fruit and lurking, earthy spice. There's a developing softness to the texture, the aromas still being worked out."
Pinot Noir,"This is a pure expression of Pinot Noir from one of Italy's first organic and biodynamic wine producers located in the far, mountainous north of the country. Aged in oak barrique, the wine is elegant, fine and silky, with beautiful aromas of wild berry, almond, cola and herb."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is solidly built with tannin and oak, a searing earthiness dulling the fruit. Tar, earth and spicy cardamom aromas domainate its full-bodied concentration and youthful ripeness."
Pinot Noir,"Scoring slightly higher than the Alderpoint vineyard-designated wine, this basic Humboldt County bottling bursts with with black cherry aroma. It's medium-bodied, free of oak-driven flavor and loaded with fruit. Lively acidity and mouth-filling texture keep the cherry and raspberry notes echoing through the finish, striking wonderful balance in an appetizing, mouthwatering package."
Pinot Noir,"From the new, négociant side of Domaine Jessiaume, now owned by Scottish businessman Sir David Murray. The wine hints at the grandeur possible from Clos de Vougeot without quite achieving it. The power is there, but without the black richness. Instead, there are fine tannins, firm dark fruit skins and elegance. Age for 3–4 years."
Pinot Noir,"Undeniably riper than the 2011, this soft and smooth wine offers pretty red plum and cherry pit flavors, lightly spicy and supple. Lovely though it is, the wine tilts toward a high-toned finish, suggesting that it's best consumed young."
Pinot Noir,"Intensely perfumed, this wine has soft tannins and a smooth, red-fruit-dominated texture. From a 3.5-acre premier-cru vineyard, it is ripe while light in character, suggesting it will age smoothly and quickly. The wine is almost ready now, although it will be best from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"Attractive red fruits and freshness combine to produce a lively, elegant wine with a light structure and complete fruitiness. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,"Lucky Failla gets to source grapes from this vineyard that most winemakers would trade their left arm for. It's lush, ripe and amazingly generous in raspberries and cherries, yet retains an elegant balance, as well as fine, mouthwatering acidity. Part of the attraction is low alcohol, which lets the stones and earthy complexities of the wine shine through. This is really a brilliant wine—light, delicate and powerful. If you want to age it for eight years or so, you won't be sorry."
Pinot Noir,"Winemaker Gustavo Gonzalez left Robert Mondavi to do his own thing, and what an auspicious start. He's taken fruit from this historic Carneros vineyard and crafted a big and bold yet balanced Pinot filled with lusciousness. The flavors are enormously complex, ranging from fresh raspberry jam and cranberries to red currants and persimmons. Earthy cola, mushroom and forest floor notes add complexity. The acid-tannin balance is just about perfect. Good as it is, this compelling Pinot should develop well over the next six years."
Pinot Noir,"Dusty and toasty, with plenty of spice and just a hint of composty barnyard, this biodynamically farmed fruit brings in subtle notes of dried leaf and herb. Cranberry fruit flavors roll into fine-grained tannins and a medium-long finish."
Pinot Noir,"Shows the Morgan signature of full-bodied weight, concentrated raspberry and cherry fruit, brisk acidity, notable tannins and dryness that make their Pinots Noirs so enjoyable. Very nice to drink now and over the next 3–4 years."
Pinot Noir,"Owned by the Devillard family, Château de Chamirey produces firmly textured wines. This Mercurey is on the dry side, while not losing sight of fresh red-berry fruits and bright acidity."
Pinot Noir,"Right off the bat, this Pinot impresses for sheer depth of fruity flavor. It's rich and showy with plums and cherries, spicy notes of tobacco and pine, and toasty, new oak. The tannin-acid structure is impeccably balanced. Delicious to drink now, but should also mature beautifully. A majority of the grapes come from the winery's Wayfarer Vineyard, in the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation."
Pinot Noir,"With brisk acidity, a bone-dry finish and some dusty tannins, this is an interesting Pinot Noir, with a silky texture and cherry jam, pomegranate and cranberry flavors that are ready to drink now."
Pinot Noir,"This reserve offers rather light strawberry fruit, and some highlights of tobacco and milk chocolate. It spent 18 months in one-third new French oak. Despite the reserve tag and the excellent vintage, it comes across as simple and a bit dilute."
Pinot Noir,"Light and clear in color this wine is somewhat simple on the palate and marked by the presence of oak. Light bodied, it has flavors of baked bread and strawberry jam that get along well before a wave of vanilla lingers on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Doesn't taste quite ripe, with very dry, herbal flavors and also a strong hit of acidity. Almost suggests wintergreen sour candy, although there's some decent cherry and cola, accented, of course, by oak. Awkward, but could just be young. Hard to tell."
Pinot Noir,"The 2005 Pinot Noir from Honeywood is a dead ringer for—guess what!—the 2004 Pinot Noir from the same winery. Soft entry, herbal and somewhat stemmy mid-palate, tannic, slightly hot finish."
Pinot Noir,"From a very reliable series of well-priced wines, this one shows a clean nose of slate, rose petals and a hint of lilac. The light and airy flavors are reminiscent of rose water, with olallieberry and hibiscus elements spicing up the palate."
Pinot Noir,"Broad aromas of black cherry and black-tea spice make for a dark and full nose, which is enhanced by strong soil components of turned loam and gravel. Dark boysenberry and tart plum skins show on the palate along with more tea spice, making for a very full sipping experience."
Pinot Noir,"This clonal combo from a meticulously tended family vineyard shows iron, cranberry, strawberry blossoms, sagebrush and a wound-up minerality on the nose. Sanguine flavors power the tip of the palate alongside cranberry and pomegranate fruit. A suave spiciness of dried mint and menthol emerges in the midpalate."
Pinot Noir,"Plump yet bright with fruit, suave yet spicy with herbs and gamy elements, this bottling shows candied cherry and cranberry alongside sage, eucalyptus and slight barnyard notes. The same juicy red fruit immediately elevates the palate, which is then leveled by lively Mediterranean spice and a buoyant acidity."
Pinot Noir,"Rich red cherries, raspberries, red currants, concentrated rose petals and hibiscus are cut with an edge of eucalyptus oil, chipped slate and purple sage on this stellar bottling from this producer's 25th vintage. Dark fruits of blueberry, blackberry and black cherry emerge across a deeply layered palate, which is boosted by violet and lavender florality."
Pinot Noir,"Fans of fruity Pinot Noirs will love this one, with its sweet raspberry and cherry jam flavors. Beyond that, there's not much going on. It's silky in texture, with a boost of acidity."
Pinot Noir,"Tannic and earthy, this is defined principally by flavors of stem and bark, with thin red fruits in the background. It might best accompany a rich, oily fish such as salmon."
Pinot Noir,"This is a thickly concentrated and powerfully full-bodied wine, spicy in clove and cinnamon as well as a lingering note of cola. The fruit leans into blackberry and black cherry, with a pronounced weedy, herbal undertone."
Pinot Noir,"From a replanted single vineyard, single clone site, the first vintage since that replanting in 2009, there's a youthful awkwardness still at play here, though the wine is quite juicy in black cherry and a lingering suggestion of soy. The oak and tannin are fairly firm and pronounced."
Pinot Noir,"Using grapes sourced from estate vines planted in 1972, this wine is comparable, in its subtlety and delicate elegance, to an old-vine Zinfandel. Strawberry and spice run through the core, with brambly highlights and excellent balance. The wine is still a bit closed, so give it a good decanting, or leave it alone for a few more years."
Pinot Noir,"This Gallo brand exploits extensive new Pinot plantings in the appellation to produce a wine that's clean and correct, rather than exciting. The flavors range from cranberries to black cherries, and the tannins are silky. Will improve with a year or so in the cellar."
Pinot Noir,"Earthy and herbal, this inexpensive Pinot offers faint cherry tones and a structured, juicy midpalate. The wine's pronounced tannins take center stage on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"You'll find plenty of Pinot Noir character in this wine, which is ultimately simple and for drinking now. It's silky in the mouth, with crisp acids framing cherry, cranberry, cola and oak flavors."
Pinot Noir,"Lots of ripe fruit in this wine, offering rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, persimmons and red plums, with a tart note of cranberry. Tastes fresh, lively, and rather young. Drink over the next six years."
Pinot Noir,"Has this property been making strides, or is it just the superb quality of the 2013 vintage? Either way, this is a wine worth trying. The cherry and spice flavors are spot on, as is the medium body, silky mouthfeel and long, crisp finish. Drink now–2020."
Pinot Noir,"A bright, spicy oak note in the aroma sails through the flavors and adds a nice lift to the ripe red cherry and plum flavors. It's a medium-bodied wine, with mild tannins and a generous, smooth texture."
Pinot Noir,"Dry and elegant, this Pinot has a Central Coast feeling, with a pale color and brisk acidity. The cherry, cola, spice and oak flavors seem a little simple now, but that could be deceiving, as years in the cellar might benefit."
Pinot Noir,"This is a ripe wine. Red plum and berry fruits are given weight and richness by the solid tannins, smoky flavors and the dryness at the heart of the wine. Give this structured wine time to develop and drink from 2021."
Pinot Noir,"There's been lots to like from this SoCal winery, and this bottling adds to the list. Rusty in color, it offers cranberry, strawberry, sagebrush and iron aromas. The palate pops with zesty pomegranate fruit, lifted by herbal garrigue notes and spice."
Pinot Noir,"This wine's peppery details act as counterpoint to its well-defined raspberry and cherry flavors. Streaks of toast and graphite add to the layers, suggesting further complexity will develop with another year or two in bottle."
Pinot Noir,"There's weightiness to this big, bold, flavorful wine that exhibits concentrated berry and cherry cola that persist in a full-bodied way. Accents of minty earth and floral aromatics provide a hint of herb and lightness."
Pinot Noir,"This delicious, compelling, full-bodied wine blends luscious fruit flavors like red cherry and boysenberry with stylish, spicy oak accents and a firm backing of acidity and tannins to keep the mouthfeel vital. The fruit and softly spicy nuances mingle beautifully and seem to melt in the mouth. It's great to drink through 2020."
Pinot Noir,"This is proving to be a great vintage for this emerging producer in an increasingly exciting region of mid-Monterey County. Graphite, crushed rocks, rose petals and cranberry show on the nose, followed by a palate of black peppercorns, eucalyptus, snappy black raspberry and lots of black clove."
Pinot Noir,"This is subdued, almost invisible, with herbal flavors accented with bitter greens. Barely ripe red fruit leaves a flat taste, with no life in it. Two bottles tasted."
Pinot Noir,"This puts the spotlight on a single Dijon clone and delivers polished cherry fruit. It follows through with hints of graphite and the underlying minerality that is characteristic of this AVA. The wine is young and should be decanted, having spent just nine months in barrel prior to bottling."
Pinot Noir,"Some overripe and green notes dilute the cherries of this Pinot. It's dry and silky, a sound wine for drinking now."
Pinot Noir,"From grapes grown at some of the Willamette Valley's highest elevations, this is a pungent mix of citrus oil, grapefruit, metal shavings and stone. The flavors persist along that path, crafting a sleek and distinctive wine that in many ways is the antithesis of the fleshy, jammy, fruit-forward style of many domestic Pinots."
Pinot Noir,"Earthy funk and black tea surround dampened mushrooms, giving this wine a feral quality before a lift of red rhubarb and strawberry pie provide juicy succulence. Cola and vanilla make appearances toward the finish, which builds in intensity of oak."
Pinot Noir,"Emblematic of the emerging trend of pushing finished alcohol levels down and aromatics up, this puts the flavor emphasis on subtle complexity. It offers a full range of tart red fruits, along with seams of dried leaf and milk chocolate. It was entirely whole-cluster fermented, and aged 16 months in 15% new oak."
Pinot Noir,"A soft, aromatic entry opens into compact cranberry and raspberry fruit. This wine is young and firm, beautifully balanced, and still showing some stiffness in the tannins. It does a clean, gentle fade, retaining its freshness all the way."
Pinot Noir,"Another Joe Davis wine that's benefited from patience, this bottling offers more mature character than the same vineyard's 2009. Umami touches of soy, shiitake and leather underscore the cherry and raspberry scents on the nose. It has a grippy texture and a subtly presented range of flavors—from dried anise and Christmas spice to elderberry, cranberry and dried plum skin."
Pinot Noir,"Lots of rich raspberry, cherry and cola flavors in this Pinot Noir. It has a delicate, silky texture and some true complexity, but is a little too soft to age. Drink up."
Pinot Noir,"Mulberry, crushed slate, turned earth and a touch of clove can be found on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard planted by the Franscioni and Pisoni families. The sip shows rusty rhubarb and beet juice, with some tart cranberry, sour cherry and graphite rounding out the flavors."
Pinot Noir,"Char and toast singe ruddy black cherries and plums in this dark, full-bodied Pinot Noir. It's plush and luscious in texture, with brambly notes on the midpalate and fine, slightly bitter tannins lend complexity."
Pinot Noir,"Pale salmon in color, but quite robust in flavor and alcohol, this brings concentrated flavors of watermelon and raspberries, with all the freshness of the newest vintage. It's bright and focused, the very picture of what is most exciting about these seasonal Northwest rosés."
Pinot Noir,"This is indicated as a reserve-level selection, but at the moment remains unfocused, and even a bit dilute. Tart fruits and tight tannins never quite fit together. The drying finish carries a hint of wet cement. Give this at least another year or two of bottle age."
Pinot Noir,"Aromatic, with an elegant blend of mountain berries, just-ripe cherries and a refreshing minerality, this estate-grown fruit is farmed organically and biodynamically. The balance and detail are impressive."
Pinot Noir,"This is ripe and muscular without being overly oaky. Cherry fruit is supported by a balanced dose of cedary oak, but the tannins come largely from the fruit, suggesting decent aging potential. The finish is dry, firm and long, further bolstering that impression. Drink 2017–2025."
Pinot Noir,"A vibrant minerality consumes the aromas on this bottling from an extremely coastal vineyard. On the palate, strawberry and sagebrush flavors emerge, all couched in a clean, crisp and refreshing acidity with appropriate bitterness as well. Ready to drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Baked blackberries, nutmeg and star anise aromas make for a dense and full but not overly powerful or rich nose on this bottling. It's fairly thick and soft in body, but with some textural grip, showing flavors of black plum skins, graphite and sandalwood, before finishing on a eucalyptus kick."
Pinot Noir,"A shy, mineral-leaning nose offers pencil shavings and dark raspberry notes. The palate proves more dynamic, with sagebrush, red cherries and anise seed, showing lots of energy but nothing too complex."
Pinot Noir,"This is an absolutely lovely Pinot Noir that's softly refined and balanced, yet so complex. It's silky and dry, with waves of raspberries and cherries, red currants, mocha, red licorice and sautéed wild mushrooms. Drink now–2015 for fresh appeal."
Pinot Noir,"The husband-and-wife team behind this label deliver a well-balanced, approachable but serious wine in this bottling. Aromas include red rose, dark violet, pomegranate, limestone and clove. On the palate, there is luscious black cherry fruit, with slate and acidity to stand it up straight."
Pinot Noir,"Pas de Nom, meaning “no name” in French, is intended as a self-effacing moniker for the winery's top cuvée. A barrel-selection, it's front-loaded with big cherry-pie fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is light and buttery, with a pleasing lick of caramel, while the tannins have some muscle and a hint of stem. This young, powerful wine should drink best 2018–2025."
Pinot Noir,"Ripe, fruity while also rich, this is a soft wine that's developing quickly. It has some smokiness, gentle tannins and a juicy texture. Drink this already easy wine from 2015."
Pinot Noir,"A rich style from winemaker Bill Brousseau, this shows smoked pork, plum, boysenberry and dashes of dried ginger on the nose. Rounded black-plum flavors arise on the palate then tighten toward elderberry, brisk cranberry, bay leaf and green peppercorn, altogether savory and tart."
Pinot Noir,"Dark and deep aromas of black cherry, clove, allspice, black pepper and char make for a hearty impression on this appellation blend. The palate is also rich and powerful, its thick mouthfeel showing black cherry, cocoa, vanilla and a touch of asphalt. A rocky minerality and minty finish complete the experience."
Pinot Noir,"The impressively plump and prominent strawberry and red-currant aromas are alluring on the nose, enhanced by touches of cinnamon and pepper dust. The palate combines savory pepper spice, red plums and berries, with a solidly simmering acidity shimmering through the entire sip."
Pinot Noir,"High-toned, red cherry fruit aromas on this bold, full-bodied Croatian Pinot transition nicely to a deeply concentrated black fruit palate sprinkled with cocoa and vanilla notes. The texture is lush overall, but grape tannins feel harsh and grippy on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Slightly shy aromas of blackberry, black plum and turned black soil are simple and straightforward on this wine. The palate combines pencil lead with anise, thyme, marjoram and black pepper, framed by tart cranberry, beet juice and sour-cherry fruit. A sip enlivens the mouth and wipes clean on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"The alcohol on this bottling is lower than most Fe Ciegas have been in the past, reflecting the cool vintage. The wine seems more austere than in the past, withholding a bit of the early appeal it used to show. Nonetheless, it's wonderfully structured in acids and tannins and very dry, with a judicious application of oak, and there are intricate flavors of cherries, red currants and herbs. Seems like it could shine with age, so give it six years in the cellar."
Pinot Noir,"Despite the name, this is the value offering, not the reserve, from Soléna. Young, tart and tight, it displays primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, with sharp, lemony acids. Holding until 2016–2017 may help to smooth it out, but it's perfectly delightful already."
Pinot Noir,"Unfortunately only available in Bermuda, this wonderful bottling shows salted brambleberries, crushed violets, asphalt, rosemary and pinpointed florality on the fresh yet concentrated nose. The palate is zesty and darkly focused, with elderberries, stewed plums, thyme and Earl Grey tea. It's quite a complex effort."
Pinot Noir,"Aged for 14 months in wood, this wine is perfumed and soft. Red fruits and attractive acidity give a wine that is ripe and almost ready to drink. It comes from the village just north of Gevrey-Chambertin in the Côte de Nuits. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,"This is a medium-bodied, somewhat chunky Pinot Noir, but does manage to combine plummy aromas with distinctively Pinot-like sous-bois character. The flavors turn tart and savory, ending on a pomegranate note."
Pinot Noir,"There's a very intriguing sachet-like aroma to this bottling, reminiscent of a potpourri bag left in a cigar box alongside pipe tobacco and sweet cherry syrup. Sour cranberry fruit leads the sip, where the herbal character is impressively pervasive, though perhaps a tad too much so."
Pinot Noir,"The most notable thing about this Pinot is its intensity of flavor. A blend of both new Dijon clones and older California selections of Pinot Noir, it is stunning with flavors of raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper. It's a balanced, elegant wine with vibrant texture , but needs time to truly shine. Hold till at least 2017."
Pinot Noir,"This is a warm wine with a rounded feel, making it soft and full of red fruits. It features strawberry sweetness as well as a tighter, more tannic character. It could well age, so wait until 2016."
Pinot Noir,"Spy Valley's 2007 Envoy Pinot Noir is an attractive wine, featuring an exterior of brown sugar, dry leaves and coffee and a fruit-filled cherry center. The only concern is the slightly drying finish and some slightly coarse, rustic tannins. If those resolve gracefully, this rating may look stingy in 3 years' time."
Pinot Noir,"Dark reddish-orange in color, this medium-bodied rosé offers refreshing acidity against a dramatic backdrop of intensely etched flavors, a mix of dark cherry, strawberry and blood orange that refreshes and rewards."
Pinot Noir,"Firm in tannins, but bright with cherry fruits, this has lovely youthful acidity. Firmer tannins promise good aging over the next 4–5 years."
Pinot Noir,"This wine from the most northerly of the Côte d'Or appellations is a blend from multiple growers. It has red cherry and plum fruit with a fresh streak, typical of the vintage. Underlying firm tannins will sustain it as it ages. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is rich and ripe, oozing with black cherry, boysenberry and strawberry jam aromas and flavors. It feels full and rather soft on the palate, as the acidity and tannins appear very mild."
Pinot Noir,"It's Pinot-esque in the cherry and raspberry flavors and light, silky tannins, which make for easy drinking. Crisp acidity boosts the flavors and adds zest and life. Certainly a simple wine of little depth, but will suffice for an inexpensive Pinot Noir."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is on the light side, with pretty cherry and mushroom flavors. Crisp and stony on the palate, a mouthwatering tartness rings on the finish. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"Tastes harsh and a little stemmy, although you'll find Pinot's silky texture and nice flavors of cherries, red currants and cedar. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"This opens with a pleasing toasty aroma, following through on the palate. That deft touch of French oak (33% new) frames a solid core of strawberry preserves and Bing cherry fruit. It resonates on through a stylish, textural finish. Enjoy this immediately, and tuck away a few bottles to drink in five years."
Pinot Noir,"This wine has a richness that borders on candied, a celebration of ripe raspberry and cherry with medium weight and body around strong streaks of tannin."
Pinot Noir,"This is Buena Vista's basic Carneros Pinot, but it's certainly a wine worth investigating. Dry and tart in acidity, it has flavors of cranberries, sour-cherry candy, oak, and earthier notes of rhubarb and heirloom tomatoes that give it savoriness. Drink now until 2015–2016."
Pinot Noir,"Light in weight and lacy in texture, this is a savory, subtly flavored Pinot Noir that's ready to drink. Notes of smoke, mushrooms and dried herbs intertwine with tart fruit."
Pinot Noir,"Good concentration and a classic Oregon Pinot mix of herb and fruit characterize this winning effort. Dried herb, thistle, berry, cherry and a Dr. Pepper streak are all in the mix, with hints of earth and stem."
Pinot Noir,"The wine is King Estate's superpremium offering, made exclusively with organically grown grapes from the estate vineyard. Lush and earthy, it's got a lot of forward, tart berry fruit power, turns a bit soft in the middle, and sails away with a hint of heat and a lick of chocolate."
Pinot Noir,"A supple, medium-bodied Pinot Noir with a pronounced acidic edge. Cranberry is the starring fruit here, framed by coffee-like oak. Crisp and a bit astringent on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"This wine is produced from old-vine Pinot Noir planted on flint soil. The wood from the wine's aging does show, giving a spicy, smoky character that is still dominating the red-cherry fruits. This will balance out over the next few months to give a wine with concentration. The aftertaste brings out acidity. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,"A delicious aromatic range of smoked meats, spicy strawberries and cinnamon-laced churros introduce this wine from one of the appellation's most promising vineyards. Red fruits and brown spice power the palate, with noticeable tannins and a good wash of acid on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"All estate-grown grapes go into this early release. Juicy cranberry and raspberry fruit, tart and slightly savory, backs into drying tannins, finishing with a touch of stem."
Pinot Noir,"Rich, thick and robust, this offers a mélange of black cherry and strawberry. A fruity element dominates over any savory varietal character."
Pinot Noir,"A pretty, light-weight wine that offers up smoky, herbal scents along with almost ephemeral wisps of red fruit. It's dry and delicate; a waif-like Pinot that could benefit from a little more flesh. —J.C."
Pinot Noir,"Kathleen Inman has gained such a following with her Rosé that she's given it a special designation, a nod to her happy marriage. Made in a direct-press style, the dry, refreshing wine is light salmon in color and marked by aromatic grapefruit and strawberry, mouthfilling and juicy as a slice of watermelon in summer."
Pinot Noir,"Given 22 months in new French oak, this reserve Pinot Noir still brings the fruit front and center. Blackberries rule here, but there is a strong menthol/mint streak as well, which leaves the palate feeling as if a curiously strong breath mint has recently passed through. Kason seems to have great fruit sources, packaged in a rather rustic style, but offering quite delicious and bold flavors at moder prices."
Pinot Noir,"This wine brings spicy cranberry and strawberry, underscored with a whiff of leather. Flavors punch down and finish strong, with a leathery note that does not preclude the solid fruit."
Pinot Noir,"Like all of Melville's new 2011 Pinot Noirs, this bottling is powerful and forward in cherries, raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola, alongside earthier mushroom and earth notes. It's a beautiful wine that shows the classy elegance of a well-grown Santa Rita Pinot, with brisk acids and firm but fine tannins. Drink now–2017 for maximum freshness."
Pinot Noir,"Winemaker Larry Cherubino has crafted an excellent yet affordable Pinot Noir. Hints of cedar and vanilla accent the cherry fruit, while the texture is appropriately supple without being overripe. The oak is prominent, but the weight and texture hit the mark. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"This is a rich, rounded wine with pure red berry aromas. The initially soft tannins has a dryness that creeps up as the fruit increases in its richness. Layers of wood spice support the fruit rather than dominating."
Pinot Noir,"This AVA-specific cuvée brings a sharp focus to mixed fruit flavors of raspberries laced with citrus highlights. It's a pretty wine, smooth and fresh and forward. Drink over the next three or four years."
Pinot Noir,"The fruit and juicy acidity are the focus here, supported by smoky tannins. The wine will develop relatively quickly, full of fruit. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,"From an extreme-coastal vineyard near Cambria, this shows lots of low-alcohol, low-ripeness qualities on the nose: Kalamata olive, sautéed brown mushrooms, wet asphalt and just the slightest hint of raspberry and cranberry. There is tons of tingly acidity on the palate, along with flavors of tobacco, marjoram, dewy oregano and barely ripe cherry tomato. Drink 2020–2030."
Pinot Noir,"A little sharp and awkward in the mouth, with some green flavors leading to a tart finish. There are enough berry, cherry and oak flavors to make the wine interesting. Shows a classy dryness, but doesn't seem to have the balance to age. Drink up."
Pinot Noir,"Firm and solid with great swathes of black fruits as well as dense tannins. Ripe fruits are a major element of this concentrated wine. The wine has power and a firm tannic core, and certainly needs aging for seven years."
Pinot Noir,"So deliciously forward in raspberries and cherries, you're tempted to drink it now, and that's fine. You can. But the wine is balanced enough in acids and tannins that it will gain traction over six years or so. The vineyard is a great one, source over the years to high-scoring Pinots from MacPhail, Fulcrum, Expression 38 and others."
Pinot Noir,"There's an impact of treacly grenadine-strawberry on the nose of this wine that suggests full-bodied ripeness, but on the palate it underwhelms in light, diluted flavor and texture. The finish is short."
Pinot Noir,"Much like its companion Rumba Pinot, this is light and tart, with sour cherry fruit. A whiff of smoke and streak of bell pepper come through in the finish, which is pleasant but quickly thins out."
Pinot Noir,"Rich red cherry, rust, smoke and crushed gravel aromas show on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard. Smoked meat, lavender and rose petal notes play with cranberry, pomegranate and hibiscus flavors, creating a pleasant mix of delicate and savory elements."
Pinot Noir,"The delicate structure on this Pinot immediately appeals. It's all silk and satin, gliding across the palate with mouthwateringly crisp acidity that gets you ready for rich fare, like steak, tuna, lamb. A dried thyme earthiness suggests its warmer Napa origin, but the strawberry and cranberry fruit is evocative. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,"With smoky aromas, this starts out as an enticing wine. On the palate, the fruit is surprisingly soft for a Nuits-St-Georges, with the wine's evident structure showing an open character, edged with wood and red plum and currant flavors. The dry tannins give shape, but do not dominate this big wine."
Pinot Noir,"Ripe, sweet-fruited wine, its red berry fruits and opulent tannins giving a rounded feel. There is, as well, a good structure composed of acidity, licorice and wood. It needs 2–3 years still to really develop all its depth of flavor."
Pinot Noir,"A highly-regarded California producer of Pinot Noir dips its toe into the Oregon waters with this inaugural vintage from the Roserock Vineyard in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA. It's impressive, elegant and sensual, with the subtle complexity for which the grape is famous. Rose petals, red fruits, light spices, a compelling texture and mouthfeel, and overall elegance all point to a wine with a decade or more of life ahead."
Pinot Noir,"This fine new offering is whimsically packaged with a screw cap and a floral label. That spirit is further evidenced by the wine's pretty pink color and subdued, light building of flavor, highlighted by orange, peach and strawberry notes and a substantial bite of mouthwatering acidity."
Pinot Noir,"From vines just to the north of Nuits Saint-Georges, this firm and structured wine features ripe fruits, red berries and bitter cherry flavors. Both dark in texture and perfumed, it's powerful and does need some aging. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,"Despite the effects of a cool year, this wine is still enjoyable. Its cherry fruit is tinged with notes of root vegetables and beet greens, and while there's ample weight, the tannins are just a touch drying on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Production is lower for this cuvée in 2010, and the sources now incude Nysa and Ribbon Ridge along with Maresh. Aged in one-fifth new French oak for just under a year, it remains tightly wound, with tart, primary raspberry fruit wrapped in moderate acids. There are delicate herbal notes sprinkled throughout. Overall this is elegant, balanced and strongest on the midpalate."
Pinot Noir,"A big style that manages to avoid tasting rustic or heavy. Starts with baked pastry shell, black cherry and plum, then adds in hints of licorice and black pepper. Could use a touch more richness in the midpalate, but closes nicely, with fresh acidity that perks up the fruit flavors."
Pinot Noir,"One of the four vineyards that this winery entirely uses as a monopole bottling, this wine shows smoked pork, baked raspberry, crushed rosebuds and a touch of sesame on the nose. The palate's backbone is a tangy cranberry fruit that is enhanced by pencil lead and cedar spice."
Pinot Noir,"This full-bodied wine is complex and detailed from the spicy perfume to the finish, and rich and satisfying in the middle. Aromas like black tea and rhubarb lead to ripe and deep cherry and slightly tangy raspberry flavors that are lifted by moderate tannins and linger on the finish."
Pinot Noir,"Textured in bold cranberry and strawberry fruit, this older Pinot still offers plenty of fruit and weight, though neither will necessarily last much longer. It shows a softness, and streaks of herb and allspice, too. This wine offers a chance to travel back in time to a healthy vintage for Anderson Valley and see the intermingling of savory with sweet."
Pinot Noir,"One of the most remote and unusual vineyard sites in Oregon, the Maple Ranch provides ripe grapes at lower alcohol levels. The reward can be found in the delicate but real accents—subtle spices and surprising length."
Pinot Noir,"A heavy chaparral element consumes the nose of this wine, with sagebrush, eucalyptus, pencil lead and just a touch of elderberry fruit. The palate is all about tart cranberries and sour cherries, with a bit of graphite minerality holding it together. It's a brisk and earthy sipper."
Pinot Noir,"This focuses on the Wadensvil clone, and seems almost spritzy—it's definitely a tongue-tickler. Cherry cola flavors highlight sweet, primary fruit. Refreshing, though probably best enjoyed within the first couple of years."
Pinot Noir,A light and fruity wine with attractive red fruits and acidity. There is just a touch of tannin to hold the friendly fruitiness together.
Pinot Noir,"Winemaker John Benedetti relies on a single clone usually used for sparkling wine in this bottling from a 25-year-old dry-farmed vineyard at 1,700 feet. Aromas of buttered cherries, rhubarb, red flowers, cinnamon and milk chocolate give way to a palate that shows lots of slate and graphite as well as dried cherry, eucalyptus, dried mint and a touch of leathery gaminess."
Pinot Noir,"This Pinot is a little heavy in the mouth. It's front-loaded with raspberry and cherry jam fruit, while plenty of oak slathers it with butterscotch and caramel. It's not an ager, so decant and drink up."
Red Blend,"Inviting aromas of blackberry, cola and mixed spices are thorough. This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend feels fresh, with balanced acidity and tannins that prod and poke. Lightly herbal, woodsy berry and plum flavors finish with classic Chilean notes of olive, tobacco and foresty spices. Drink through 2023."
Red Blend,"Made from the estate's oldest vines, this silky blend of 95% Schiava and 5% Lagrein opens with a fragrance of wild berry and alpine herb. The vibrant palate doles out layers of sour red cherry, juicy raspberry, mandarin orange and a light almond note alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Enjoy soon to capture the delicious fresh fruit flavors."
Red Blend,"A blend of Cabernet (70%) and Merlot, it offers aromas of dried herbs and rasinated dark fruit along with a kiss of vanilla. The fruit flavors are plump in feel with a sweet finish."
Red Blend,"Good for Valdivieso that they are willing to experiment with a Mourvèdre-led blend that also contains Carignan and Syrah. This is racy and a bit tangy, with plenty of old-vines acidity making the wine a bit jumpy and scouring. Probably best with food; it's a bit astringent on its own."
Red Blend,"Made with 50% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of bell pepper and clove. The aromas carry over to the straightforward palate together with red berry and a hint of leather. Enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"This wine takes a modern approach, recognized by the ripe blueberry, currant, vanilla and toasted nut aromas that characterize it. The wine is soft and silky in the mouth with a caressing quality and bright spice notes on the finish."
Red Blend,"ReNoto shows ripe aromas of black cherry, strawberry and blueberry jam. The wine is juicy and succulent and delivers a blast of bright fruit on the close."
Red Blend,"Prune, leather, oak, vanilla, underbrush and mint aromas lead the nose. The austere palate isn't very expressive, showing subtle oak, toast and espresso in the forefront with notes of dried cherry alongside tightly drying tannins."
Red Blend,"Deep berry, cola, mint and leather aromas are classy and not overdone. Feels lush and deep in the mouth, with blatant ripeness and toasty, oaky flavors of cola, coconut and blackberry. Finishes big but not that long or complex. Drink now through 2013; Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot."
Red Blend,"Full-bodied, tannic, juicy-fruity and dry, this red blend has flavors of blackberries, plums, dark chocolate and anise, with spicy, earthy notes of tobacco. Made from Primitivo, Zinfandel and Teroldego."
Red Blend,"Beautiful richness and intensity make for a very welcoming bouquet. This 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend lasts long on the palate, and boasts luscious aromas of blackberry, Maraschino cherry, tobacco and lightly toasted hazelnut. Extrasoft, velvety tannins characterize the finish."
Red Blend,"This bright red blend from southern Italy offers modest aromas of black cherry, blackberry pie and crushed black pepper. The mouthfeel manages to be plush, clean and crisp at the same time."
Red Blend,"Lightly herbal, stalky aromas of berry fruits and eucalyptus are classic Chilean characteristics. This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend feels a bit short on foundation. Chunky, inky flavors of blackberry and oak are a touch green and herbal, while this is tannic and tastes of tobacco and herbs on the finish."
Red Blend,"Structured and elegant, this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot offers aromas of blackberry, red currant, blue flowers, clove and oak. The concentrate palate doles out black cherry, plum, sage, anise and tobacco alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2022."

Red Blend,"An alluring nose of violets, berries and a touch of spice begins this stylish wine from Waterford. On the palate, flowers, spice and minerals unfold and mingle with elegance. The tannins are pronounced but refined. The wine will age and offer more as time passes, but it's a gorgeous sip today."
Red Blend,"This has a pronounced nose, with aromas of black fruits swathed in savory dried herbs, mushrooms, game and smoke. The palate, by contrast, is juicy with tart black-cherry and berry flavors framed with ripe, but grippy, tannins. Pleasant now, but it could improve over the next 3–5 years."
Red Blend,"Aromas of tobacco leaf, wet soil, mature plum, resin and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The palate offers dried prune layered with notes of chocolate and grilled sage. The fleeting finish closes on a rather bitter note."
Red Blend,"Herbal and dill infuse the light flavors, and the tannins feel as if they've been softened up in the winemaking process. The wine does a quick fade."
Red Blend,"There's a lot to like about this dense, deep, lush and totally ripe blend of 60% Petit Verdot plus smaller doses of Cabernet, Carmenère, Malbec and Mourvèdre. It glistens in the glass and shows plush aromatics and generous flavors of berry, plum, chocolate and spice. Toasty and smooth on the finish. Drink this excellent blend now–2018."
Red Blend,"Exotic spice, plum, French oak and underbrush aromas lead the nose while the juicy palate offers espresso, raspberry jam and a hint of star anise. It's chewy, with close-grained tannins."
Red Blend,"Aromas of cherry cough drops and huckleberry syrup are heady and perplexing. The palate is like cough medicine, while syrupy cherry and berry flavors transition to medicinal and chocolaty. A rich, flabby finish is just more fuel for a unique but challenged fire."
Red Blend,"Made with organically farmed grapes, this opens with subtle aromas of red berry, clove and blue flower. The easy-drinking palate offers black cherry, mint and a hint of anise alongside polished tannins and racy acidity."
Red Blend,"Two thirds Tempranillo, this Spanish-style red blend is filled out with 17% Merlot, 6% Grenache, and 11% Cabernet Sauvignon. The fruit is dark and compact, but nicely framed with barrel spices that add some welcome sweetness. Tannins are hard and the finish brings in a broad swath of earth, tar and bark."
Red Blend,"Literally friends and neighbors (the guys on the label dancing and playing an accordion), this wine is a light, soft blend of Groslot and Cabernet Franc from Anjou. It is light, strawberry-juice flavored, with green acidity. Ready to drink now."
Red Blend,"This is an easygoing but richly flavored wine that starts with light toast and spice aromas preceding somewhat sweet jammy flavors, a soft texture and medium body. Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon formed the blend."
Red Blend,"Made with 80% Sangiovese, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, this offers aromas of cassis, toast, grilled bell pepper, menthol and a whiff of cedar.

Red Blend,"Half Tempranillo, 40% Barbera and 5% each Merlot and Sangiovese, this is dry and fully mature, but quite tasty. Musky scents of roses and orange peel lead into a tart palate with wild berries, and a touch of citrus oil. Drink now through 2018."
Red Blend,"Planeta has done a terrific job of communicating the merits of Cerasuolo di Vittoria to wine drinkers around the world. This light, ruby-colored red wine is packed with bright fruit nuances and a crisp mouthfeel. It makes an ideal pairing partner to the best Italian pasta recipes."
Red Blend,"Fragrant oak spice invites you to contemplate a mix of autumnal, ripe red fruit: plums perhaps, in a compote with strawberry. Mellow tannins come with echoes of clove and cinnamon. This friendly and soft red also works without food."
Red Blend,"Baked blackberry, vanilla, dust and chocolate show on the nose of this blend of 69% Petite Sirah, 22% Grenache and 9% Tannat. The palate is ripe with plum, blueberry and black currant and lifted by dried ginger and nutmeg, but the dazzling acidity and tannic firmness is what takes it to the next level."
Red Blend,"This blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Alicante and Merlot opens with a fruit and spice aroma that recalls bright red berries and black pepper. The one-dimensional palate offers juicy black cherry and raspberry along with notes of white pepper and clove. Simple and easy-drinking, it will pair well with hearty Tuscan soups."
Red Blend,"You'll discover aromas of leafy underbrush, grilled herb, raisin, new leather and a whiff of blue flower on this bold red. The syrupy concentrated palate doles out raspberry jam, stewed prune, anise and nutmeg framed in big chewy tannins. A confectionery note closes the finish."
Red Blend,"Coming in at a strikingly low alcohol for the vintage, the fruit in this blend doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with strong aromas of freshly sliced jalapeño along with leafy herbs. The flavors are tart and elegant, broadening on the finish."
Red Blend,"This blend of 32% Syrah, 16% Grenache, 14% Petit Verdot, 12% Cabernet Franc, 12% Alicante Bouschet, 7% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Petite Sirah truly sings, as the name implies. A strong boysenberry pie aroma is lifted by purple flower scents on the nose, and the palate's lush black cherry, vanilla and mocha spice flavors are reminiscent of a dessert wine without being sweet."
Red Blend,Sangiovese (60%) and equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot deliver soft tones of cherry and blackberry with white almond and toasted hazelnut on the close.
Red Blend,"Aromas of spiced plum, dark-skinned berry, leather and a balsamic note waft out of the glass. The firm palate delivers juicy wild cherry, white pepper, game and aniseed alongside firm but polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2015–2020."
Red Blend,"Smooth, deep aromas of berry, spice, earth and minerals are rolled into a pure, harmonious whole. This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is racy, clean and layered on the tongue, while oaky flavors of vanilla and cream are backed by ribald blackberry and cassis. The elegant finish is potent and deep. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,"Underbrush, grilled herb, roasted coffee bean and dark-skinned berry aromas unfold in the glass. The elegantly structured palate delivers red cherry, raspberry, sage, anise and clove framed in bright acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,"Perhaps Temecula's future is in Super Tuscans. This balanced blend of 50% Sangiovese, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc offers a complex nose of cranberry, pomegranate, pencil lead and chocolate sauce. Flavors of hot brick, white pepper, raspberry and stewed mushrooms rock the palate."
Red Blend,"Here's a rich expression of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot in equal parts, with obvious notes of eucalyptus and black licorice lavished over a core of black cherry, leather and tobacco. The eucalyptus element is very evident and gives the wine a unique personality."
Red Blend,Smoky spice and dried herbs on the nose are followed by flavors of rustic spice and red fruit on the palate. Vibrant fruit and muscular tannins are integrated by a clean minerality. The wine has native character but will please many palates with its dimension.
Red Blend,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Syrah (32%) and Petit Verdot offers notes of blueberries and high-toned herbs that don't entirely seem to marry. Flavors are rich and concentrated with a supple feel."
Red Blend,"While this is piercing, aggressive and herbal on the nose, there's enough rustic authenticity, licorice and cherry character to push it along. A raw palate offers oak-based flavors of vanilla and coconut but also tart plum and currant. A wiry, shearing finish tastes oaky and feels hard."
Red Blend,"Attractive and layered with a blueberry and raspberry fruit core accented by notes of sweet spice, orange oil, ashy tobacco and a touch of dark purple florals. The gripping tannins are fine and balanced, with skin-driven fruit flavors dominating the palate and a fudgy chocolate and sweet spice note lingering on the finish."
Red Blend,"Here's a youthful nine-year-old that offers intense aromas of crushed blue flower, leather, tobacco leaf and baked plum. The savory palate delivers crushed dried black cherry, prune, vanilla and nutmeg framed in velvety tannins. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,"Mineral-driven and hard on the nose, this features toasty, smoky, chocolaty notes in addition to medicinal berry aromas. It feels juicy but also resiny and creamy, with plum and wood flavors that finish long. This is a ripe, fruity wine with plenty of oak, size and body."

Red Blend,"Light in color, this blend of 51% Syrah, 42% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon is perfumed with orange peel, coffee, plum and herbs. It drinks off dry, quite light and elegant in style with grainy tannins."
Red Blend,"This easy-drinking red delivers aromas and flavors of ripe blackberry, black cherry and a hint of clove. Round tannins provide soft support. Drink through 2016."
Red Blend,"This blend of Petite Sirah and Syrah is soft, rich and heavy. The alcohol is high, and the wine has some heat in the mouthfeel, with jammy raspberry, cherry and sweet oak flavors."
Red Blend,"Emiliana began as Vinedos Organicos Emiliana, but now goes only by Emiliana because getting certified as an organic winery proved too difficult. Still, Emiliana's vineyards are organically farmed, and this five-grape blend made by Alvaro Espinoza is intense and extracted yet still finely knit. It's a serious wine with slight herbal/pine aromas, robust red-fruit flavors, and a smooth, stylish finish. Not overdone, so drink now."
Red Blend,"This wine begins with aromas that recall red peppers, black berries and spice with a whiff of grilled sage. The palate offers ripe black cherry and plum accented with white pepper and cinnamon-spice and thyme. It still has youthful, aggressive tannins that need a few more years to soften. Drink 2016–2021."
Red Blend,"Produced from organically grown grapes, this wine is soft, with raspberry flavors and acidity in equal abundance. It's light in color, tastes mature and should be drunk now."
Red Blend,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot make up the majority of this blend (42% each), with Malbec, Petit Verdot and Syrah rounding it out. Aromas of toast, vanilla, cocoa, cherry and herb lead to sweet, elegant chocolate and cherry flavors, threaded with vanilla notes."
Red Blend,"Aromas of mature dark-skinned fruit, underbrush and tobacco lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The ripe, dense palate offers black cherry, cassis, clove and dried hay alongside round tannins."
Red Blend,"Here's an elegant selection that shows ample structure and balance. It has a lovely bouquet of wisteria, iris, blackberry, nutmeg and vanilla. The palate is still a bit shy but shows ripe plum, black cherry, carob, licorice and well-integrated oak notes. Give this another year to unwind."
Red Blend,"Aromas of spiced plum, coffee, leather and underbrush come together in the glass. The mature palate offers dried black cherry, tar, graphite, smoke and tobacco alongside dry tannins that leave an astringent finish."
Red Blend,"The wine has considerable acidity that comes from the balance of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon in the wine. Bold in tannins and complex in fruit flavors, it's a wine that will develop slowly and well. Drink from 2016."
Red Blend,"This lands on the sweet side of the corral, and has a good texture of tannins and acidity as well as oodles of grapy, blackberry jam flavors to complete the package. It's full bodied, rich in mouthfeel, and the ripe fruit character stays on the finish."
Red Blend,"Saggi is the super Tuscan entry in the Long Shadows portfolio, made by Ambrogio and Giovanni Folonari. Here it is a blend of 45% Sangiovese, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Syrah —not much different from 2007. Smoky in the nose, broadly fruity in the mouth, with an attractive mix of black cherry fruit and bacon fat highlights. It fades a bit in the finish, and there is just the faintest hint of onion."
Red Blend,"This is the first release of this new wine from Stonestreet. It's Merlot with some Cabernet, Syrah and Cab Franc. Grown in Jess Jackson's high mountain vineyards, it's rich and soft in black currant, cherry, mocha and smoky oak flavors, with smooth, easy tannins. Best now and through 2010."
Red Blend,"Mostly Sangiovese with smaller percentages of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this informal wine offers freshness and simplicity. You'll recognize balanced aromas of red fruit, spice, leather and a touch of chewy pipe tobacco."
Red Blend,"Spicy, slightly resinous with notes of leaf, clove and licorice that complement good dark cassis fruit. Some coffee and smoke enter into the middle and finish, though the flavors fall away rather quickly. It's well balanced and a pleasure to drink, but not built for cellaring."
Red Blend,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese, Poggio alla Guardia is bright, clean and enjoyable, and it exudes notes of cherry, blackberry and spice. It would pair seamlessly with red meat, chicken or pasta."
Red Blend,"Aromas of underbrush, espresso, vanilla and plum cake set the stage. The palate offers black cherry, exotic Asian spice, licorice and sugared vanilla alongside bitter wood tannins. Veritas Imports, Tanaro River Imports, Crown."
Red Blend,"Half of this wine is Merlot, with the rest Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Blueberry, coffee and vanilla aromas are followed by sultry plum flavors speckled with barrel accents before a mocha-flavored finish."
Red Blend,"This ripe wine has jammy red fruit flavors. The fruitiness is given structure by the stalky tannins and the dry, wood-aging flavors. Black cherries and juicy black currants show strongly. It needs to age, so drink from 2016."
Red Blend,"The Alatus blend is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, with Merlot, Malbec and Syrah also in the mix. Dark and spicy, it remains compact and toasty, with a solid core of cassis, coffee grounds, cedar and smoke. The barrel influences (40% new) are well displayed, but the rest of the wine needs more time to catch up."
Red Blend,"Aromas of steeped cherries, ripe plums, scorched earth and a medley of cooking spices lead the nose on this round, rich wine. The lush palate doles out ripe black cherries, raspberry jam, licorice and a dash of black pepper while velvety tannins lend finesse."
Red Blend,"Black plum, boysenberry and fig flavors fill this soft and generous wine. It has a medium-red color, medium body and very fruity aromas. A relaxed, broad texture makes it easy to drink."
Red Blend,"Smoky, oaky aromas and flavors make a big impact as this medium-bodied wine floods the mouth with ripe fruit, black pepper and grilled meat flavors. But it keeps its composure, not pouring on too much alcohol or tannin."
Red Blend,"The third vintage of Mith is the best yet, composed of fruit from three top-notch Walla Walla vineyards. It's two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one third Syrah. The wine opens seductively with luscious blueberry, blackberry and black cherry fruit, wrapped in sexy layers of earth and herb. Whiffs of smoke lead into a silky smooth, chocolaty finish."
Red Blend,"Campaccio Riserva is a bold, modern blend of Sangiovese and Cab Sauvignon from an estate in Radda in Chianti. The wine delivers loads of fresh spice, clove, black peppercorn, coffee and vanilla over solid red fruit."
Red Blend,"A classic Gaillac blend of Duras, Gamay, Merlot and Syrah, this is a bright, fruity wine, the lighter of the two wines produced at Château Lecusse. Red berries dominate, allied to crisp acidity."
Red Blend,"Straightforward but structured, this opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, wet soil and stewed plum. The palate offers dried cherry, raisin, nutmeg and seasoned herbs framed by firm tannins."
Red Blend,"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah and smaller amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot shows prominent black cherry, cedar and licorice flavors, along with a streak of tobacco. Full bodied and moderate in acidity, it finishes simply."
Red Blend,"This popular blend, now up to nine grapes sourced from across the Columbia Valley, spends time in 40% new oak. This 2009 lives up to past vintages, though perhaps falling on the lighter end of the scale, with pleasant fruit flavors and a hint of toast."
Red Blend,"Roasted at first, with smoked ham and bacon aromas along with clove and other hard spice notes. The palate is oaky, with chewy tannins and a thick texture; flavors of blackberry are meaty and rich, while clove and more dry spices reappear on the finish. A different breed for Mendoza."
Red Blend,"An appealing combination of sweet fruit and savory mocha and balsamic aromas lead on this easy-drinking wine from KWV. Flavors of mocha, spice and red berry are combined with good acidity and tannins that allow for aging. Overall, a crowd-pleasing red for myriad occasions."
Red Blend,"Half Merlot, the rest a mix of Petite Sirah and Syrah, this has a bell pepper and jalapeño greenness that can't be avoided in aroma or taste. From there, the wine seems diluted yet finishes with a hit of heat."
Red Blend,"Judicious use of new oak meets gorgeous fruit flavors in this generous, warm and softly tannic wine. It's undeniably delicious, broad and satisfying in texture and almost viscous in mouthfeel. Enjoy it now through 2023."
Red Blend,"Get to know the local red grapes of Gaillac that make up this blend: Duras, Braucol and Prunelard. Together, they create impressive structure, concentration and intensity. Acidity balances the bold red fruit and ripe cherry flavors. It's a serious wine with good potential and will be best from 2020."
Red Blend,"The tough conditions of the 2008 vintage are reflected in this scratchy wine. Plum is the key fruit aroma, and that's followed by a tight, firm body with toasty oak, black fruit flavors, herbal notes and peppery spice. Quick and a touch hot on the finish."
Red Blend,"This is a riper-style gran reserva with baked, slightly mulchy aromas of berry fruits that turn more exotic and spicy as they open. Leafy flavors of spice and earth come with caramel richness, while rooty spice and dry tannins control the finish."
Red Blend,"Sangiovese has been a major disappointment in Napa Valley, but guess what? This 97% Sangiovese, with 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, is an impressive wine, and the best of Gargiulo's current releases. It's enormously forward in cherry pastry filling flavors, while plenty of new oak adds smoky, cinnamon spicy, vanilla brulée complexities, but it's the quality of the tannins that marks the wine. For all its flamboyance, it doesn't seem like an ager. Best now through 2011."
Red Blend,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is too ripe and obvious for its own good. It's very good, offering a vast wealth of pie filling blackberries, cherries, cassis, licorice and chocolate flavors, but you find yourself wishing that, at this price, it had greater structure and was a little more aloof and tantalizing."
Red Blend,"This is half Tempranillo, one quarter Garnacha, one quarter Monastrell. Pop the cork and right away come aromas with a mix of exotic, seductive spices, vanilla, sweet grain, plum and some bakery sweetness. The fruit is plump and dotted with dried herb, dusted with powdered sugar, open and expansive."
Red Blend,"This Cab/Merlot/Syrah blend is very much in a Washington style, with crisp acids and tart berry and currant flavors, wrapped in chocolate and showing a few specks of pepper, presumably from the Syrah. It's solid and well-made and a good example of how Oregon vintners are breaking out of the Pinot box."
Red Blend,"This blend of Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot has aromas of cherry, vanilla and a whiff of lifted eucalyptus. It conveys flavors of black cherry, red plum and dried herbs. Medium bodied, it has a persistent finish."
Red Blend,"From a mix of Columbia Valley vineyards, the Bona Vita is mostly Malbec, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot contributing to the blend. Pretty strawberry fruit is somewhat overtaken by aggressively smoky barrel aging, or so it would seem. Charcoal and smoke components lend a slightly burnt edge to the tannins."
Red Blend,"This predominately Duras wine is fresh and fruity with an attractive depth of smoky tannins and structure. It is rich enough to age although its red currant fruitiness is delicious and juicy now. Drink now, or age until 2018."
Red Blend,"A lot of this Cabernet-Merlot-Syrah-Cab Franc blend is produced, and for the money it gives you plenty of enjoyment. Soft raspberry fruit seems loaded with oak-derived flavors. Toast, vanilla, bare wood, even a streak of cola come through. The wine drinks far more mature than the recent vintage, so drink up."
Red Blend,"Bright and silky, this blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot offers aromas of blue flower, spicy red berry and a hint of leather. The savory palate offers layers of crushed wild cherry, red raspberry, white pepper and clove alongside supple tannins. Succulent and easy drinking, it should be enjoyed through 2016 to capture fresh fruit."
Red Blend,"This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is vinified in steel and bottle aged. It's young and fresh, boasting bright red cherry and raspberry sensations along with notes of freshly tilled earth."
Red Blend,"This Malbec-Merlot-Tannat blend from northerly Salta is bright purple in color, with compact aromas of wood smoke, graphite, ink and blackberry. The acidity is high but functions as a brace for plum, blackberry and cassis flavors. A crisp, clampy finish is edgy due to aforementioned racy acidity. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Regent, this garnet-colored wine has aromas of cherry vanilla, eucalyptus and tobacco leaf. Flavors of mocha and blackberry lead to a balanced finish."
Red Blend,"Winemaker Kirk Venge blends 52% Cabernet Sauvignon from both To Kalon and Kenefick Ranch with 36% Sangiovese from Benessere and 12% Petite Sirah from Kick Ranch. The blend makes for a bombast of juicy blueberry pie topped by vanilla ice cream. Tannins are rounded and velvety, and the wine comes across as big and bold."
Red Blend,"Aromas of mature dark-skinned fruit, sunbaked earth, violet and a whiff of espresso lead the nose. The juicy palate doles out ripe black cherry, anise, clove and a hint of coffee alongside round tannins. Enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"The restrained aromas of black mission fig, cumin, caraway seed and cocoa are alluring but elusive. Full bodied and muscular, the palate feels a bit clamped at the moment, finishing with some warmth. A blend of 67% Tannat and 33% Petit Verdot."
Red Blend,"Pipe tobacco, exotic spice, mature black-skinned berry aromas and a balsamic note slowly emerge on this brawny red. The powerfully built palate delivers raisin, dried morello cherry, licorice, espresso and clove alongside bracing, close-grained tannins that grip the finish."
Red Blend,"Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, wild mint, dill, coffee and tobacco emerge on this full-bodied red. The round palate offers juicy Marasca cherry, chopped herb and a hint of black pepper framed in velvety tannins while a licorice note closes the finish. Drink through 2023."
Red Blend,"Made from certified organic grapes, this is a medium-bodied blend of Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Merlot. Bay leaf and black olive aromas add earthy notes on the palate, giving this ripe, chocolaty wine an anchor in the south of France. Drink now."
Red Blend,"Quater is a rich red blend that opens with blackberry, rum cake, Indian spice, cola and ground clove. It combines intensity and complexity with a bold, opulent mouthfeel."
Red Blend,"Aromas of balsam wood, dry spice, berries and vanilla are attractive and inviting. It feels lush and deep, with good layering and robust flavors of berry fruit, spice, herb and tobacco. Flush and slightly herbal tasting on the back end, this is a complex, quality blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah."
Red Blend,"Thick and luscious with deep oak tones and big cherry fruit flavors, this southern Italian red is a real fruit bomb with plush cherry intensity and ripe berry flavors. The strong sunshine has done its part to shape a thick, succulent red wine."
Red Blend,"A robust, rustic red wine for drinking now with stews, burgers, vegetarian rice and bean dishes in red sauce. The winery doesn't tell us the varietal blend, but it's ripened to the limits of raisins, and high in alcohol, with a resulting glyceriny sweetness."
Red Blend,"It's explosive in jammy, pie-filling raspberries and cherries, with a hit of caramelized oak. Drink it now with simple fare."
Red Blend,"Aromas of underbrush, leather, tar and game lead the nose. The earthy aromas carry over to the palate along with mature plum, juicy black cherry, truffle, tobacco and graphite. Smooth tannins soften up the wine's rustic, forward nature."
Red Blend,This blend of Uva di Troia and Negroamaro shows sophisticated tones of toasted nut and spice behind the notes of ripe fruit and prune. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth.
Red Blend,"Reduced aromas of iodine, latex and blackberry lead to a tannic, grabby palate with baked blackberry, licorice and rooty flavors. A warm, stewy, earthy finish is where grabby tannins dominate. This is a bold, powerful wine that could benefit from some cellaring time."
Red Blend,"Mainly Petite Sirah, this wine has a hot, baked taste, like cherry pie filling that burbled out of the crust and got burnt and caramelized in the oven. Drink now."
Red Blend,"This finessed and delicious blend of 80% Nerello Mascalese and 20% Nerello Cappuccio delivers creamy strawberry, Morello cherry, white pepper and clove sensations, with hints of Mediterranean herbs. The silky palate is balanced by bright acidity."
Red Blend,"Two-thirds of this wine is Malbec and one-third is Merlot. Aromas of asphalt, plum and orange rind lead to a palate that possesses a lovely sense of balance and length."
Red Blend,"Aromas of blueberry, baking spice and a whiff of leather lead the nose of this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot. The firm palate offers black plum, raspberry and black pepper alongside smooth tannins. It finishes on a note of mouth-puckering sour cherry."
Red Blend,"Aromas of iris, plum and woodland berry unfold in the glass. The savory palate is elegantly structured and displays juicy red cherry, red currant, anise seed and black pepper alongside supple tannins. Drink through 2018."
Red Blend,"This opens with aromas of ripe black plum, resin and nutmeg. The concentrated palate delivers mature blackberry, clove and chocolate framed in polished tannins. A licorice note signals the close. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,"Just the second vintage for this Cab/Syrah blend, it sets its umami-soaked fruit in a crusty, toasty framework. Adding a splash (here 10%) of Syrah was once known in Bordeaux as to “Hermitager” the wine, bringing color and spice into the mix. This relatively soft Cabernet shows highlights of orange peel, apricot, pepper and cured meat."
Red Blend,"Here's a blockbuster, biodynamic blend of Merlot, Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Mouvèdre, Petit Verdot and Grenache. Together, these varieties create a dark, brooding wine with notes of mature black fruit, raisins, leather, spice and beautiful intensity. It's a chewy, rich wine with creamy glycerin in the mouth."

Red Blend,"This is a stalky light wine. With black-currant fruit and layers of intense acidity, it is fruity with a cool crisp aftertaste. Drink now."
Red Blend,"This ripe, spicy blend of Niellucciu and Grenache has a rich while also fruity character. The tannins are generous, warm and allow the fruit and acidity to express themselves. It will be ready to drink from 2017."
Red Blend,"There's great spice and depth to this tribute wine in honour of Graham Joseph Beck. Intense notes of cigar box spice, black pepper, cedar bark and cocoa powder all abound in the bouquet and follow through all the way to the long close. Black fruit flavors are present, but the spice takes center stage. Firm, gripping tannins flood the mouth and linger endlessly; try from 2014 on."

Red Blend,"Salice Salentino is a historic Italian red wine made with a blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera. This interpretation shows off sun-ripened aromas of prune, raisin and cherry liqueur. The mouthfeel is plush and chewy, but also marked by a firm tannic backbone and lingering cinnamon and nutmeg."
Red Blend,"Aromas of exotic spice, prune, resin and nail polish remover lead the nose. The big, round palate delivers raisin, fig, licorice, ground pepper and a confectionary note alongside a network of polished, velvety tannins. Drink through 2026."
Red Blend,"Comes out of the chute showing a funky, rubbery edge, but that blows off with a little time to reveal dark, somewhat earthy notes of cola and blackberry. It's medium-bodied, with good length to the finish, where it picks up enough dusty tannins to give it backbone."
Red Blend,"Vintner Roberto Cipresso presents a dense and rich blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot from Sicily with ripe aromas of prune, blackberry and black pepper. The wine is dark and thick in the mouth and would pair with grilled steak."
Red Blend,"This classic Bordeaux blend—67% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot, 17% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot—is crafted from 100% Sagemoor vineyard grapes. It's chewy and herbal, with substantial tannins. It probably needs some time to smooth out the rough spots, but it's got character and a mix of Bordeaux-like cassis and herb flavors, all in good balance and finished entirely in older neutral oak."
Red Blend,"Sweet, soft and simple, with melted cherry jam and chocolate flavors. A blend of Tempranillo, Petit Verdot and Malbec."
Red Blend,"This is a five-grape blend, with leafy flavors of garden-fresh herbs as well as ripe strawberries and vanilla cream. It's a smooth and immediately pleasing wine, with a velvety finish."
Red Blend,"Seems confected, with sweet Jolly Rancher aromas playing against taut acidity. A light, tart offering best paired with tomato-based sauces—fine with spaghetti at your local Italian joint."
Red Blend,"Rooty aromas of cola nut, baked berry fruits and blackberry jam set up a plush, jammy palate of solid tannic framework. Baked berry, dark plum and loamy notes end with meaty, roasted flavors that are typical of a well-made wine from Jumilla. This is 60% Monastrell, 25% Tempranillo and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon."
Red Blend,"Intense granite tones lend elegance and complexity to this plump, cherried blend of Merlot, Dornfelder and Lemberger. Supple and round on the palate, it's framed delicately with soft tannins and a fringe of smoke and dried herbs."
Red Blend,"Aromas recall nail polish remover, black cherry marinated in spirits and exotic spice. The thick palate delivers prune, mocha, dark chocolate and coffee bean alongside velvety tannins. It has a long finish and closes on a bitter, nutty note."
Red Blend,"This is old vine Lemberger, one of the first red grapes to be widely planted in eastern Washington. It comes from a 1979 planting at the Red Willow vineyard. Raspberry and cherry fruit flavors dominate, pretty and pure, but lacking in depth. Some Lemberger can approach the style of Dry Creek Zinfandel; this is more of a simple red quaffer."
Red Blend,"Firm, pinched aromas of rubbery berry and red fruits feed into a narrow, tomatoey palate with crisp, drawing acidity and tannins. This Carignan-led blend of five grapes is herbal and briny tasting, with tomato, cassis and red-berry flavors. Length, balance and drive push an herbal finish to a good ending."
Red Blend,"Tastes new-oaky and a bit overextracted now, even overripe, with black and red currant, caramel and vanilla flavors wrapped into firm tannins. Doesn't seem like the ambiguities will age out, so drink now."
Red Blend,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this is plush and round, with bright notes of black fruit, spice, leather and blackberry. There's a touch of spice on the finish, and the texture is soft and rich."
Red Blend,"This blend of Rara Neagra and Malbec has aromas of black raspberry, black cherry and spice. There are flavors of black plum and vanilla toast with rounded tannins."
Red Blend,"Equally amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot go into this high-octane blend. There are suggestions of black olive and dried leaf, but the fruit seems canned and the tannins have a tinny aftertaste."
Red Blend,"This blend of 80% Montepulciano and 20% Merlot opens with aromas of berry, mocha and toasted coffee bean. The palate is friendly and forward, with plum and blackberry accompanied by a hint of chocolate."
Red Blend,"Made from 60% Syrah and 40% Merlot, this wine offers aromas of cigar box, toffee, red apple and herb. It drinks a hair off dry, with medium-bodied fruit flavors and gritty tannins."
Red Blend,"Aromas of toasted oak, mint, vanilla and dried berry lead the nose and continue to the palate along with coffee and anise notes. It's rather austere and lacks fruit richness."
Red Blend,"Deep garnet in the glass, this wine delivers aromas of black cherry and chocolate. There is a good mix of fruit and savory flavors in a bed of chewy tannins, featuring blackberry, plum, white chocolate, tobacco and anise. Bright fruit and light spice carry into the lingering finish."
Red Blend,"Made by Ben Glaetzer, the Heartland wines are meant to offer an affordable entry to the Epicurean portfolio. The Stickleback Red blends Cabernet Sauvignon with Shiraz and Grenache to make an attractive wine for everyday drinking. Some smoky notes frame black cherry and black olive fruit, while the texture is creamy on the midpalate, fading a bit on the finish."
Red Blend,"Menthol, savory herb and dark-skinned berry aromas lead the nose along with a balsamic note. The full-bodied but accessible palate doles out black cherry, crushed plum, sage and soothing licorice alongside velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2016."
Red Blend,"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this red offers subdued aromas of black cherry, blue flower and baking spice. On the palate, notes of vanilla and roasted coffee bean accent black plum while firm tannins provide mouth-puckering support."
Red Blend,Soleil (sun) is a trial blend on the way to becoming a 100% Cabernet Sauvignon cuvée. Mixed black fruits carry a whiff of fresh herb and peat moss. The wine is nicely balanced and of modest dimension and length.
Red Blend,"Big and flavorful, this wine smells and tastes like ripe blackberries and dried plums, and has the firm, moderately tannic texture to go with that richness. Made from a high concentration of Petite Sirah and Syrah, it's quite intense."
Red Blend,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 35% of this blend, along with 26% Syrah, 26% Merlot, and 13% Cabernet Franc. Aged in 70% new French and American oak, barrel-forward aromas of vanilla, coconut and baking spice are out in front of a medley of dark fruit. The fruit flavors are sweet, rich and luscious, with toothsome tannins providing support. There's plenty of enjoyment to be had but the barrel influence is pretty intense."
Red Blend,"A blend of 80% Negroamaro and 20% Malvasia Nera, this has aromas that recall weedy underbrush, black plum, resin, nutmeg and toasted oak. The dense palate offers mature blackberry, dried black cherry, fig and clove alongside angular tannins. It's reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"This is a big, blockbuster blend of Cab, Alicante and Petit Verdot with thick extraction and raw tones of fruit, tobacco and spice that liven up its chewy, textured mouthfeel."
Red Blend,"Aromas of underbrush, blue flowers, cooking spice and black plum unfold in the glass. A blend of 50% Sangiovese and 50% Malvasia Nera, the palate reveals dried black cherry, black pepper and anise alongside firm, polished tannins. Drink through 2017."
Red Blend,"Fleshy blueberries are met with soft vanilla notes on this full-fruited yet light-footed red. On the palate the bursting blueberry notes are even more appetizing and joined by pleasant pepper with just a hint of tobacco. There is something rather seductive about these fruit-driven reds that deliver more than simple fruit. Utterly delicious, very elegant and dangerously drinkable."
Red Blend,"Red currant, French oak, espresso and cedar aromas emerge on this blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. The taut palate offers sour cherry, licorice, grilled sage and oak-driven spice alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins that grip the finish."
Red Blend,"Generous berry aromas smell floral. In the mouth, this is plump and soft in the middle but more tannic and stout on the edges. Baked blackberry, plum and cassis flavors finish with hard tannins and a sense of extraction. Expect a very full, chunky and ultimately satisfying Garnacha-based ride."
Red Blend,"Rosemary-marinated steak, roast pork roll stuffed with prunes or dark chicken or turkey meat would make perfect paring partners to this red blend from southern Tuscany. Aromas of spice, mature cherry and leather are soft and penetrating."
Red Blend,"Well-concentrated black-cherry flavors give a great core of fruit to this well-balanced, full-bodied and lightly tannic wine. It has more grip and less obvious oak than many others."
Red Blend,"This is an impressive blend of 45% Merlot with 25% estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah from Stagecoach Vineyard and 10% Biale Zinfandel. It comes together seamlessly in a twist of structured blackberry, leathery tannin and tomato leaf, priced to be enjoyed by many."
Red Blend,"Righteous is a new budget label for Sweet Valley Winery. Mostly Merlot, this smooth, fruity red wine is ready to drink. It tastes like a latter-day version of the Hearty Burgundies of old, only with better fruit, and a hint of hazelnut in the finish."
Red Blend,"Generic berry aromas with a hint of tomato and bramble set this off as a different breed, which it is, considering it's 78% Tannat. The palate has biting tannings and toughness, while the flavors of raspberry and strawberry are snappy. Finishes strange, with pronounced butter and foxiness. Has its positives and negatives."
Red Blend,"Hard spice, blackberry and leather form a firm opening salvo, then oak, mocha and chocolate notes take over on the bouquet. The palate is firm and healthy, with minerally berry, spice, leather and chocolaty flavors. Long, alert, pure and driving on the finish. Drink now through 2016."
Red Blend,"“The Affair” refers to the relationship between the French and Italian varieties in the blend. Sadly, this isn't the hottest affair, with the strong game, red currant, strawberry hull, milk chocolate and smoky dried salami notes all downplayed by the lean mouth and waxy finish."
Red Blend,"There isn't enough fruit on this high flier to give it the unqualified seal of approval. In fact, for $50 it has its issues, namely a nose of boot polish and grainy oak. Seems like the fruit is fading and what's left besides some light raspberry is unabsorbed oak and thin, grabby tannins. Not a bad wine per se but not a big success either."
Red Blend,This elegant 50-50 blend of Barbera and Nebbiolo (a popular blending formula for many Langhe red wines) offers the pulpy fruit and acidity of Barbera set against the finesse and menthol-like intensity of Nebbiolo. It's a match made in heaven.
Red Blend,"This Syrah/Grenache/Mourvèdre blend, finished in screwcap, is always one of Washington's best values and flat out most delicious Rhône blends. The 2006 is the best ever, with dark, supple fruits that weave together berries, cherries, plums, cassis, licorice, pepper and Provençal herbs. It's a riot of flavors, young and brash, but perfectly capable of aging."
Red Blend,"This is a Cabernet Sauvignon-driven blend, with 25% Merlot and 12% Petit Verdot. Generously oaky and ripe, it offers textured layers of graphite, cigar and cedar. An exciting sideshow of spicy Mexican chocolate accents deeper, darker shocks of black cherry."
Red Blend,"Made from Syrah, Petite Sirah, Dolcetto and Malbec, this wine is bone dry and acidic yet tastes overripe. Although the alcohol is refreshingly low, it has a raisiny flavor and bitter raisin-skin-like tannins."
Red Blend,"This tasty Rioja has an almost chewy feel. Tart dried fruits, leather, licorice and menthol oak aromas and flavors come together well in this—especially at this age—fairly full-bodied wine. Dark and handsome, it still has some tannins to shed, and finishes long and dry. Drink now–2007. —M.M."
Red Blend,"Earthy aromas of blue flowers, game, tilled soil, red berry and leather come together in the glass. The elegant palate offers juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and savory herb, while a backbone of firm but fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity provides an age-worthy structure. It's still a bit austere, but will blossom into a beauty over the next several years. Drink 2016–2025."
Red Blend,"It's rare to see a bottle from this appellation at this price and even harder to find one of high quality. This one delivers. A blend of 38% each Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, it shows pleasing aromas of raspberries, black cherries, flowers and plum. There's a silky feel to the chocolaty flavors that linger on the finish."
Red Blend,"With huge amounts of graphite, toast, wood grain, blueberry and blackberry aromas, this Cabernet Franc-led blend (with Malbec and Petit Verdot) is solid as granite, with a layered structure. Flavors of blackberry, chocolate and herbs dance together, while the finish is long, dark, minty and chocolaty. Best from 2016 through 2022."
Red Blend,"This 90% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 10% Canaiolo Chianti opens with subtle blackberry and moist earth aromas. Morello cherry fruit dominates the palate, accented by baking spice notes and round tannins. Enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"A blend of Sangiovese and 7% Canaiolo, this bright red opens with pretty aromas of violet, woodland berry and a whiff of baking spice. The vibrant palate offers tart cherry, black raspberry and anise alongside sleek tannins and fresh acidity."
Red Blend,"Dark, dense and delicious, this inviting blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and a tiny amount of Petit Verdot delivers ripe blackberry, dark cherry, cocoa, clove and cinnamon. Full-bodied but velvety tannins and soft acidity give a smooth texture, making this wine extremely approachable. Enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"This blend of Sangiovese and 10% Merlot opens with aromas of forest floor, ripe blackberry, cedar and menthol. The warm, evolved palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, mint, ground pepper and a gamy note alongside assertive, almost gritty tannins that leave an astringent finish."
Red Blend,"This is a fine, all-purpose red blend, mostly Cabernet, with time in one-third new French and American oak. Heavily charred, smoky and earthy, it's got a fair amount of dark cassis fruit to carry all the barrel toast and finishes with some notes of bark and stem."
Red Blend,"Perfumed in dried herb and cigar, this is a supple, round, high-toned wine, made from largely Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Dolcetto. Red cherry dominates, almost like a kirsch, while the restrained oak makes it easy to enjoy now."
Red Blend,"This appealing blend of 70% Montepulciano and 30% Sagrantino offers up aromas of bright fruits and meat juices. The savory palate delivers flavors of juicy plum, raspberry and licorice. It's round and ready, with polished tannins, so enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"Delicate scents of blue flower, red berry and pressed powder float out of the glass. The palate shows good structure for the vintage, offering juicy wild cherry, anise and a hint of chopped herb accompanied by lithe tannins and bright acidity. Drink through 2017."
Red Blend,"Sharp in acids and a little green, this dry red wine tastes like an old-fashioned Chianti. The flavors are of red cherries, herbs and pepper. Made from 70% Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc."
Red Blend,Overripe aromas of raisin and prune are matched on a dense raisiny palate that tastes like baked black fruits. The entirety of this wine is raisiny but not unfriendly or difficult.
Red Blend,"Perfumed and high-toned, this is an impressively crafted and priced blend of 35% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Malbec, 16% Grenache and 5% Petite Sirah. It shows a peek into each variety's personality, luxuriating in black pepper, leather, meat and black jam, with a juicy lushness to the palate."
Red Blend,"Fresh and tight, this Morellino offers loads of cherry and blueberry flavors, followed by distant tones of leather and moist earth. There's a simple but genuine quality to the wine."
Red Blend,"This fabulous blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot delivers loads of plush softness and succulent richness. Aromas of chocolate, ripe fruit and spice are distinct and clear, and the wine shows compelling complexity and intensity overall."
Red Blend,"One of the first Super Tuscan wines, this iconic blend of 80% Sangiovese, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc opens with aromas of scorched earth, underbrush, ripe plum and a whiff of blue iris. The palate offers dried black cherry, prune, mocha, licorice and clove. Assertive but refined tannins provide the framework. Drink 2016–2021."
Red Blend,"This Limnio, Mavrotragano and Mavroud blend is fun and fruity but at the same time, offers some serious character. Smoked sausage, fennel and clove on the nose lead into flavors of vanilla, red fruit and savory spice on the palate. Balanced, with good tannic and acidic structure. Ageable."
Red Blend,"Foresty blackberry aromas come with a whiff of mint and herbs. This has a lively, moderately tannic palate that's home to raspberry, plum and vanilla flavors. It's a basic, steady, satisfying blend of Cab Franc, Syrah and Merlot."
Red Blend,"A blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah, this conveys aromas of scorched earth, crushed flower, dark berry and a whiff of cooking spice. The palate offers ripe cherry, graphite, ground black pepper and a smoky note alongside velvety tannins."
Red Blend,"A blend of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot, 18% Petit Verdot and 5% Petite Sirah, this is fruit forward, with abundant notes of dried dark cherry, cassis, Red Vines and barrel spices. The flavors are plump, painting around the edges initially before fleshing out with the Petit(e)s providing some grip to the tannins."
Red Blend,"Despite the moniker, this blend of Counoise, Mourvèdre, Malbec, Zinfandel and Petit Sirah strays pretty far afield from the southern Rhône. It's an edgy, stylized effort, light with tart rhubarb fruit, wild berries and plenty of tongue-tingling acidity. Yet it does not lack for flavor, detail, or interest. For acid hounds."
Red Blend,"Made by consulting winemaker Herb Quady, this yummy blend of Syrah, Tempranillo and (a splash of) Malbec is a showcase for what are arguably Southern Oregon's three best red grapes. Plum and cherry flavors are limned with citrus-tinged acids, making a tasty quaffable red, ready to deliver mid-week pleasure."
Red Blend,"Black cherry, red currant and coffee aromas take center stage and carry over to the palate, along with notes of espresso and black pepper. Dense with firm tannins, it will pair well with hearty Tuscan soups."
Red Blend,"Hot and poorly structured, with o.k. cherry cola aromas but very little on the palate. Tastes tart and of sour plums, with a short, starchy, tannic finish. Raw stuff that's not that good in the scheme of things."
Red Blend,"A nontraditional blend of 44% Zinfandel, 31% Syrah, 15% Merlot and 10% Petite Sirah, this bottling shows tight blueberry, milk chocolate, river rocks and rose petals on the dynamic nose. The palate is juicy with more blueberry and vanilla, but bound by a plum-skin tartness and a decently strong tannic grip."
Red Blend,"Aromas suggest tilled soil, mature blackberry, leather, game and allspice. The lively palate offers prune, cherries marinated in spirits, ground black pepper and licorice alongside a firmly tannic backbone and brisk acidity. Drink 2016–2012."
Red Blend,"This red blend is 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 3% Syrah—peppery, tannic, and fruity. A jam and toast style, it shows some heat in the finish."
Red Blend,"Not as full bodied as the tall bottle might indicate, this is instead a restrained, not-so-ripe wine that has an appetizing dryness, firm tannins and supportive acidity. It smells and tastes like dried cherries and cranberries, with a slightly astringent mouthfeel that will wash down rich foods well."
Red Blend,"It's nice to see the quality of this wine reach new heights, as it's still relatively affordable within the Henschke context. The blend includes Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. The 2013 shows a slightly austere side, an aristocratic reserve, but the flavors are classic. Pencil shavings, mint, cassis and cigar box finish with great drive, length and dusty tannins. Drink 2023–2035."
Red Blend,"A superripe 50-50 split between Primitivo and Zinfandel, this mix has a sweet thickness filled with dark plum, black cherry and vanilla-laced molasses. Full bodied to say the least, it'll pair well with sweet sauces and glazes."
Red Blend,"This Merlot-Zinfandel blend is very dry, full-bodied and rustic, with blackberry, currant, herb and cedar flavors that have bitter tobacco notes on the finish. Good with everyday fare."
Red Blend,"Buoyant aromas of boysenberry juice, white pepper and a touch of rosemary show on the nose of this blend of 34% Merlot, 33% Tempranillo and 33% Syrah, whose name means “my steps” and is an homage to the parents of winemaker Edgar Torres. Sticky tannins frame a medium-weight body full of sage, bay leaf and peppercorn flavors, which decorate the elderberry fruit. This is still a very young wine."
Red Blend,"An oaky, earthy aroma and lots of deep, jammy fruit flavors define this full-bodied but very smooth Zinfandel and Barbera blend. While fairly big in impact, the tannins are not very prominent so the mouthfeel and finish are gentle."
Red Blend,"A mix of 48% Merlot, 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot, all from Pickberry Vineyard, this wine is surprisingly light bodied and lean, despite a big presence of tobacco and grippy leather. The fruit is elusive, finishing with a flurry of cedar and clove."
Red Blend,"You'll find aromas of violet, iris, red berry and baking spice on this savory blend of 90% Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah. The vibrant palate doles out wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and a hint of tobacco alongside polished tannins and bright acidity."
Red Blend,"Roughly two-thirds Cabernet Franc and the rest Gamay, this is a peppery, tartly acidic red wine. Its sharp-edged berry fruit is braced with lemony scents and acids. Tannins are drying and a bit edgy."
Red Blend,"Carmione is a 50-10-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot that opens with a bright bouquet of wild spice, black fruit, prune, plum and rum cake. The wine is dense and dark with a thick, almost gritty feel in the mouth. This is a bruiser that would pair with mesquite-grilled ribeye steak."
Red Blend,"Vivacious and juicy blackberry flavors are spiced by cola and root beer on the nose of this annual fund-raising bottling by Raymond Smith, and it also shows a touch of chalk on the nose. River stones and gravel minerality are present on the sip, with fresh black plum, more blackberry and dried mint rounding it out."
Red Blend,"Cherry and raspberry aromas are also stalky and gamy, a likely reflection of the 75% Syrah in this blend with Garnacha. A hard, grabby palate holds flavors of herbal plum and grape skins, while an obtuse finish tastes a little green."
Red Blend,"Fresh and appealing, this unusual blend of 80% Barbera and 20% Sangiovese really works. It's crisp and delicate, with obvious vanilla and mocha notes from 10 months aging in oak barrels and a medium, very berry finish. Try with grilled meat."
Red Blend,"What a beauty! Masculine aromas of black fruits, cola and oak sit there begging to be sipped, while the lush, deep palate is home to dense blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Lively but dense, with tannins, plenty of oak and a finish of black pepper, fudge and vanilla. Complex and exciting Spanish wine. Needs time; best from 2012 through 2018."
Red Blend,"Aromas of baked dark-skinned fruit, cedar, cooking spice and a balsamic note unfold in the glass. A blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Sangiovese, and 5% Cabernet Franc, the firmly structured palate delivers ripe black currants, dried black cherries, clove, mint, tobacco and anise alongside tightly woven but fine-grained tannins. Give this time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2017–2023."
Red Blend,"Hefty and a tiny bit herbal on the nose, with tomato, red berry and spice aromas. The palate is perfectly formed and balanced, with roasted berry, smoked meat and earthy flavors. Turns juicy and dry on what amounts to a tight finish. Excellent modern Rioja to drink now through 2015."
Red Blend,"Velázquez's most successful and consistent effort is this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. It's crusty and dark on the nose, with magnanimous baked-fruit, earth and berry aromas. The feel is just right and the wine shows few, if any, faults or breaks. Overall it's pure and fades away with rich, dark flavors and velvety tannins. A New World red wine that's sure to please. 350 cases made."
Red Blend,"Here is a masculine and robust blend of Sangiovese, Cab Sauvignon and Merlot that exhibits thick concentration and aromas of exotic spices, cherry, prune, plum, vanilla and Amaretto. The nose is gorgeous but the mouthfeel is less convincing, with firm tannins."
Red Blend,"This is extremely fruity, with an exotic bouquet of blueberry, cardamom, nutmeg and earth aromas. It feels smooth, collected and fairly rich, with savory, lightly baked flavors of black fruit. The finish remains savory, where graham cracker sweetness and roasted qualities dominate."
Red Blend,"Simple and straightforward, it conveys bright berry sensations of juicy black cherry and raspberry with a light touch of cooking spices. With a soft, round texture, it is extremely accessible. Drink now."
Red Blend,"Super smooth and complete on the nose, with black fruit, toasty oak and earth notes rolled into a nice whole. It's lush, plump and balanced, with full blackberry, raisin, chocolate and spice flavors resting in front of a mellow, spicy finish. A pretty, balanced blend of 75% Tempranillo and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon that shows Jumilla at its best."
Red Blend,"Fruit compote—plum and strawberry—is melded to light toast and coffee. The wine has juicy acids and a thickly satisfying midpalate whose fruit flavors linger on, adding a little peppery spice as the wine evolves in the mouth. Just a whisp of chocolate leaves you ready for the next sip."
Red Blend,"Cerasuolo di Vittoria is a light, fragrant red wine that pairs with creamy shrimp risotto or white meat. Measured and elegant in terms of intensity, it offers pleasing freshness."
Red Blend,"Here's a wine that delivers big, ripe fruity tones such as sticky black cherry and blackberry comfiture but that leaves just enough room for those distinctive Sardinian notes of Mediterranean herbs. Pair this wine with red meat, especially lamb, and roasts."
Red Blend,"Mouthfuls of black cherry, raspberry, nutmeg and cinnamon abound in this wine. It boasts a beautiful structure coupled with elegant freshness. Drink now through the next few years."
Red Blend,"Easy drinking, this is rich in raspberry and cherry flavors, with enough acidity to give the fruit a tangy edge. The unusual blend is mostly Tannat, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah."
Red Blend,"This appealing, southern Rhône blend is a Châteauneuf-du-Pape style, with lush, forward red fruits and pleasing traces of the estate vineyard's characteristic dusty tannins."
Red Blend,"Made with organically farmed grapes, this opens with earthy aromas of ripe black fruit and whiffs of barnyard. The rustic palate offers fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry and gamey notes alongside rather fleeting tannins."
Red Blend,"Aromas of leafy underbrush, steeped prune and a whiff of dark kitchen spice lead the nose. The dense palate offers dried black cherry, raisin and licorice alongside tightly packed, drying tannins."
Red Blend,"DuBrul is perhaps the single most sought-after vineyard in the entire Yakima Valley, and at this price this Tamarack selection is an absolute steal. Pomegranate, blueberry, black cherry and cassis notes lead into a full-flavored wine that remains concise and perfectly defined. The blend is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc. This is concentrated, with earthy depths suggesting Dr. Pepper, espresso and dark chocolate."
Red Blend,"Italian varietals can excel in this SoCal zone, and this Sangiovese-led Super Tuscan blend is a prime example, with crushed graphite, tobacco, juicy blackberry and woodpile notes on the nose. Dried oregano, marjoram and thyme arise on the palate, with a sultry baked-plum flavor on the midpalate and pencil shavings and incense throughout."
Red Blend,"Briny, leathery, horsey berry aromas are alarming at first but settle in due time. A chunky mouthfeel struggles before finding its timing, while oaky flavors of hickory, bitter char and black fruits finish baked and herbal. This is good but raw, raspy and green."
Red Blend,"A cofermented field blend of 56% Malbec and 44% Tannat, this pairs two of Troon's strengths in a single bottle. Deeply hewn fruit flavors of raspberry, blackberry and cherry combine in a powerful wine that's laced through and through with streaks of tobacco, leather and smoke. It's supple and smooth, and drinks beautifully right out of the bottle."
Red Blend,"This earthy Tuscan offers aromas that recall underbrush, berries, violet and spice. The juicy palate delivers ripened dark cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and cinnamon-spice alongside chewy tannins and fresh acidity."
Red Blend,"Dense cassis and berry aromas aren't nuanced or complex but they sure are correct and ripe. Overall, this value-priced wine is rich and balanced, with good acidity and a chewy palate that softens up with time. Plum, berry, cassis and cherry flavors are tasty and easy to like."
Red Blend,"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Syrah, this wine is very rich and extracted in pie-filling fruit flavors. The grapes certainly had no trouble getting ripe. It's a little heavy and soft in the mouth, and not likely to age, so drink now."
Red Blend,"This bold, firm-textured and full-bodied wine still sips easily because of its elegant balance and fine-grained tannins. It smells like sweet oak and red cherries, tastes like ripe black cherries and chocolate, while the texture is mouthfilling but velvety. Those delicious nuances linger on the finish, too."
Red Blend,"Tremenel has an earthy fragrance of underbrush, tobacco and ripe black fruit with a whiff of spice. The palate delivers a tight core of black cherry layered with raisin, white pepper, nutmeg and cocoa backed up by bracing but refined tannins."
Red Blend,"This red blend is snappy but also jammy on the nose, with a blueberry aroma and a pinch of green. The mouthfeel is syrupy and big, with jammy flavors of baked berry and cherry. On the finish, there's enough acidity to keep it fresh as the red berry and cassis flavors take over."
Red Blend,"A blend of 90% Sangiovese, 8% Canaiolo and 2% Colorino, this has earthy aromas of truffle, sunbaked soil, leather and a balsamic note. Round and savory, the smooth, polished palate tastes of raspberry jam, ripe black cherry, licorice and a hint of pipe tobacco. Velvety enveloping tannins provide the framework while a dried herb note accents the finish. Enjoy through 2022."
Red Blend,"Full-volume cherry and cassis are in the lead on the nose. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère is robust and ripe. Raspberry, red plum, strawberry and pie cherry flavors cover the full red-fruit spectrum, while the finish remains fruity and bright, with a ton of energy. Drink through 2022."
Red Blend,"This is a dry wine meant for the dinner table. It has blackberry and raspberry aromas, concentrated fruit flavors, firm tannins and a taut finish. It will be best to drink after 2018."
Red Blend,"Pinched aromas of leather, tomato and Mexican chile are low on fruit. This Bordeaux-style red blend is chewy and dense, with full tannins. Rubbery, herbal black-fruit flavors are gritty, while the finish is minty and exceedingly herbal and leafy, with a compost note."
Red Blend,"There's nothing to dislike about the 30th anniversary release of this iconic Australian wine—only the price is hard to swallow. Cedar, earth and mint frame the nose, while the dark-fruit and rich cola flavors ease across the palate in a wave of creamy tannins. It even firms up a little on the finish; could age until 2020."
Red Blend,"Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, the blend also includes about one third Merlot and a splash of Syrah. Tight and somewhat reductive when first opened, it slowly unwraps into a substantial effort, dense with berry, cherry and cassis concentrate. Some not-quite-integrated green tannins remain, and the buttery finish also wants more bottle age. But a good effort overall."
Red Blend,"Complexity in terms of both fruit flavors and oak-induced spices make this wine fun to taste. It has light baking-spice aromas, ripe fruit flavors like black cherry, and a lightly tannic texture."
Red Blend,"This wine is an extrovert, boasting powerful jammy and smoky aromas, very ripe blackberry and maple syrup flavors, a dry impression and a good, thick layer of tannin."
Red Blend,"Shannon Ridge is quietly becoming the king of Lake County, offering wines of both quality and value and this is no exception. This blend is made of Zinfandel, Syrah, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourvèdre. The kitchen-sink approach doesn't muddle the wine in any way; it remains a smooth, fruity, ripe quaff, with a kick of vanilla on the finish."
Red Blend,"The results of a partnership between Golan Heights Winery's Chief Winemaker Victor Schoenfeld and world-renowned winemaker and consultant Zelma Long, Rom (meaning “summit” in Hebrew) is a reference and tribute to the culmination of their relationship. The inaugural effort is a gorgeous wine composed of 37% Syrah, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon and 29% Merlot aged in French oak for 21 months. The result is a powerful, lush and concentrated wine loaded with black raspberry, blueberry, thin mint cookies and savory spice. Full weight with forward tannins and medium acidity, this is an Old World wine with a New World attitude."
Red Blend,"A blend of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah, Damis is a plump, jammy wine with bold aromas of strawberry and blackberry preserves, spice and toasted nut. It's an easy-drinking wine with a fresh, almost sour note on the close."
Red Blend,"Aromas of baked plum, vanilla, raisin and a confectionary note emerge in the glass. On the palate, notes of ground black pepper and chocolate accent the core of black cherry and raspberry compote alongside firm, fine-grained tannins."
Red Blend,"Named after a work by the Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro, this spicy, earthy, slightly herbal blend of mostly Carmenère and Carignan offers aromas of tobacco, licorice root and anise. The palate is tight and fresh, but with padding. Earthy berry, hoja santa and tobacco flavors finish with a touch of oak and related graphite. Drink through 2023."
Red Blend,"Peperino is an informal blend of Sangiovese and Merlot with bright, clean berry nuances and mild shadings of spice and herb. There's a Mediterranean quality to this wine that helps it pair with most Italian, Greek or Spanish meat dishes."
Red Blend,"Soft, sweet and syrupy, a simple wine with sugared raspberry flavors. But it's clean and drinkable."
Red Blend,"This multigrape blend opens with spicy aromas of baked plum, tomato and cumin. The mouthfeel is fresh and dry, with focus. In terms of flavors, it's earthy, with baked berry, baking spice and licorice notes. The finish is smooth and earthy tasting, with roundness. Drink now through 2016."
Red Blend,"Spicy oak aromas waft from this concentrated and full-bodied wine. It smells like clove, cinnamon, cardamom and vanilla, and tastes dry, firmly tannic and as spicy as it smells. While the oak is strong, enough rich fruit flavor and firm structure counterbalances it."
Red Blend,"Attractive aromatics and plenty of complexity are the pluses; the minus is a healthy dose of bell pepper. Smoke, herbs, eucalyptus and sour cherry hang on a claret-style frame. —J.C."
Red Blend,"A whole lot of varieties figure into this blend, from 32% Petite Sirah and 26% Syrah to 20% Petit Verdot and 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, the remaining 5% comprised of Grenache. They combine for a medium-bodied, somewhat unformed expression of ripe plum and leatheriness, finishing just the slightest bit sweet."

Red Blend,"This full, ripe, balanced Priorat is a touch oaky and creamy up front, with schisty berry scents resting below the surface. Medium but nice on the palate, this offers cherry, currant, plum, coconut and marzipan flavors prior to an oaky, rooty tasting finish with ripe berry flavors. Drink now through 2021."
Red Blend,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend opens with gritty black fruit aromas accented by licorice, olive and old leather. A racy red fruit palate has plenty of acidic fuel, while flavors of raspberry, red plum and spicy oak eventually turn chocolaty. Fig, herb and tomato flavors add complexity to the finish. Drink through 2019."
Red Blend,"A kitchen-sink blend of varieties with Merlot (44%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (26%) taking the lead, this wine offers appealing aromas that suggest high-toned, sweet barrel spices, plum and herbs. It's loaded with cranberry, cherry and plum flavors with a rich mouthfeel that keeps the interest high."

The black fruit of the palate is spiced heavily with cardamom and clove. The rising acidity and firm structure show most on the finish."
Red Blend,"Fresh and youthful, this opens with cherry and blackberry scents. It shows firm tannins and good structure on the finish. The blend is 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon."
Red Blend,"This is a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Aromas of barrel spice, herb and coffee lead to easy-going vanilla and coffee flavors. Barrel notes are dominant but it brings appeal."

Red Blend,"This blend remains severely tannic, but it's also very ripe, with flavors of baked cherries, blackberries and prunes. It's a big, deep, dark, brooding wine that's probably at its best now."
Red Blend,"A little too fiery and monotone for me. Noticeable alcohol, on the nose and at the end, weighs down the edges, and frankly the dark-style fruit is forced to wear a heavy blanket of sizzle and barrel char. Has its merits, but you better be able to handle the menthol, cola, char and heat to get into the game."
Red Blend,"One of the few red dessert wines with obvious new-oak flavors, this wine smells smoky and toasty. It tastes sweet and black peppery, and is very full bodied."
Red Blend,"This vintage has some Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot in the blend to back the Sangiovese and Merlot, and is more complex and complete. There's cherry, tobacco, leather, spice, black fruit and a touch of cool freshness in the form of leafy greens. It's a sophisticated wine with tight tannins and a long, dusty finish."

Red Blend,"I Castagni (the chestnut trees) is a beautiful blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Teroldego (a native grape of northern Italy) that ages 18 months in barrique to achieve impressive richness, density and persistency. The aromas include crushed stone, ripe berry, blackberry, coffee, tar and chocolate."
Red Blend,"A rugged, country-style wine, dry and sharp in acids and tannins, with blackberry and herb flavors. Made from Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and several other varieties, it's a decent everyday sipper."
Red Blend,"Yorba and 3rd Generation are the brands made by viticulturist Ann Kraemer of Shake Ridge Ranch. This wine is meant to serve as a second label, a blend of 84% Zinfandel, 10% Petite Sirah and 6% Tempranillo made by one of Ann's nephews. It's an impressive first attempt, robust and gamy in soft leather and ripe chewy plum."
Red Blend,"You can't beat this low price. No wonder Vitiano is a constant feature on wine lists at restaurants across Rome. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese offers spicy oak notes, with suggestions of ripe cherry, blackberry and spice."
Red Blend,"This is a dark and tannic wine, very firm and dense. It has weight while also allowing room for acidity. The ripe blackberry fruits are still buried beneath this tannic character, needing more time to show through. It is likely to remain a dry wine with a tough aftertaste."

Red Blend,"Blackberry ice cream, vanilla and licorice meet with fudge and espresso on the immensely rich nose of this blend of 55% Petite Sirah, 26% Zinfandel and 19% Syrah. Blueberry and cassis dominate the palate, which is soft in texture and full of chocolate, cherry cordial and fig flavors."
Red Blend,"The complement to the Camerata from Cadence, this estate-grown blend is 52% Cab Franc and 48% Merlot. There's a juicy core that is delightful, with ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit. Both of the Cara Mia wines see 50% new oak for a full 18 months, and at this early age this shows as aliquorous, almost bourbony aftertaste. The aromatics display dark notes of smoke and coffee, along with some mocha and cracker."
Red Blend,"A blend of 60% Prokupac and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon this Serbian wine smells of red cherry and blackberry. It is full bodied, while tasting of black cherry and blackberry. The finish is fruit filled with a touch of leather."

Red Blend,"Closed aromatically at first, this medium-bodied wine develops dark plum and cocoa notes amidst a juicy mid palate. Dusty tannins end things nicely. There's not a lot of red wine out there of this quality at this price."

Red Blend,"Aromas of tilled soil, leather, spiced berry and menthol lead the nose. The palate offers blackberry, Marasca cherry, cedar, mint and white pepper alongside fresh acidity and assertive but fine-grained tannins that leave a somewhat drying finish. Drink 2016–2020."
Red Blend,"A blend of 90% Merlot and 10% Carmenère, this opens with aromas that recall red currant, toast and a balsamic note. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, leather, game, truffle and a cedar note alongside supple tannins."
Red Blend,"Based on Syrah, this is a distinguished, upscale blend. It's bone dry and quite tannic, with crisp Central Coast acidity, but most importantly it shows deep, intricate flavors of blackberries, currants, licorice, cola and sandalwood. A very fine release from Tolosa."
Red Blend,"Camarato is a beautiful wine and the 2004 vintage shows impressive harmony and elegance. The wine opens with aromas of chocolate, black cherry and spice. In the mouth, it shows firm, enduring tannins. Pair it with a succulent steak."
Red Blend,"Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and a drop of Petit Verdot go into this quintessential bottling from the Tuscan coast. It opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, baking spice, aromatic herb, violets and a whiff of wet soil.

Red Blend,"A lovely blend from the Languedoc comprised of 60% Cabernet Franc, 30% Syrah and 10% Merlot. The nose and mouth offers loads of menthol and garrigue herbs (especially lavender) along side bright small red berries and sweet green pepper. Medium weight and well structured with a lengthy finish."
Red Blend,"A blend of Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot, this is a clumsy wine. It's soft and overripe, and the oaky overlay doesn't do anything to improve the situation."
Red Blend,"Aromas of black currant, blue flower, tilled soil, menthol and cedar take center stage. The dense palate delivers mature black cherry, crushed raspberry, mocha, vanilla, nutmeg and a confectionery note. Velvety tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2022."
Red Blend,"This opens with rustic aromas of barnyard, wet animal fur, game and overripe black fruit. The overripe quality carries over the palate along with notes of bacon, rubber and fleshy blackberry. It finishes on an unpleasantly bitter note."

A round mouthfeel with depth and density features blackberry, spice, mocha, coffee and chocolate flavors; herbal notes, olive flavors and a chewy texture characterize the finish. Drink through 2018."
Red Blend,"This is a hearty coming-together of Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Syrah and Petite Sirah. It dances in baked plum and raisin as a tartness of cherry and savory dried herb counterbalances the rich ripeness and sizable tannin."
Red Blend,"Subdued aromas of red plum, baking spice and a warm, yeasty whiff that recalls bread dough come together on this 90% Sangiovese and 10% Mammolo blend. The simple, lively palate offers tart sour cherry and orange peel accompanied by zesty acidity."
Red Blend,"Bob Betz calls this his first-ever “reserve style” wine from Bordeaux varieties. It started with a single barrel of Red Willow Cabernet Franc and evolved into this six-barrel blend. Le Parrain opens with whiffs of smoke, gun metal and rock weaving through the dense red fruits. Pipe tobacco and licorice flavors come into play from the barrel aging. As the wine slowly opens, the flavors expand and blend, and the textural quality that Betz refers to expresses itself in a graceful, three-dimensional finish."
Red Blend,"You might not know it from the name, but this is a bit of a critter wine, as Bulldozer is a nickname for the hairy-nosed wombat. In any event, it's a step up from much of the competition, offering sturdy cassis flavors tinged with pepper and herbs and a clean, mouthwatering finish. Imported by MHW, Ltd."
Red Blend,"This vibrant wine opens with aromas that recall tilled soil, iris, strawberry and an earthy note of porcini mushroom. The racy palate offers underripe wild cherry, grilled herb and a hint of baking spice while smooth tannins and bright acidity provide an easy-drinking framework."

Red Blend,"Aromas of moist underbrush, saddle leather, dried herb, menthol and a whiff of game take shape in the glass. The firm palate offers raw sour cherry, cranberry, cinnamon and a hint of tobacco while close-grained tannins provide the framework and leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink."
Red Blend,"Raisiny, inky aromas are ripe but not overly sophisticated. On the palate, grabby tannins are drawing and heavy. Flavors of raisin and prune carry over from the nose, while the finish is chewy, jammy, raisiny and offers a licorice/anise note."
Red Blend,"This opens with aromas of spirits, underbrush, menthol and dried tobacco leaf. The assertive palate displays dried sour cherry, raisin and licorice alongside astringent tannins. It lacks fruit richness while scorching alcohol dominates the finish."
Red Blend,"This bright, brambly red blend of two Turkish grapes, the Öküzgözü and the Bogazkere, is brisk and bold on the palate with a striking red cherry acidity. It's delicate in fruit profile, but lushly textured with layers of fine, chalky tannins that penetrate deeply on the finish."

Red Blend,"Black pepper, espresso, dark berries and woody herbs show on the nose of this blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Sangiovese, 13% Petit Verdot, 6% Merlot and 6% Freisa from the Los Alamos and Valley View Vineyards. Stewed blackberries and more pepper show on the densely structured,  acid-laced palate, which also offers coffee and dark chocolate flavors."
Red Blend,"Earthy, herbal aromas are heavy and consistent with the winery's other 2011s. A choppy, raw, tannic palate and herbal, saucy berry flavors finish with notes of green herbs, tomato and bell pepper. This has a fine texture, yet the flavors are not ripe or appealing."
Red Blend,"Forward notes of black fruit and cherry are followed by touches of white almond and rum cake. This oak-aged blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Merlot, Teroldego and Syrah is tangy and fresh."
Red Blend,"An impressively structured wine, this great blend of Négrette, Syrah and Malbec shows intense tannins underlying powerful juicy black fruit flavors. Aromatic, spicy and driven by its dry texture, it should age for several years."
Red Blend,"This shows dark berry aromas with hints of toast and sandalwood. The palate delivers black fruits layered with licorice, spice and espresso, but it's a bit shy on length."
Red Blend,"This is Brian Carter's SuperTuscan blend––Sangiovese-dominated with 18% Cabernet Sauvignon and 11% Syrah. Stiff and unyielding when first opened, it rewards decanting with a broader expression of black, tarry fruits, black olives, coffee beans and dark chocolate."

Red Blend,"The label doesn't tell us what the blend is, but it's a blend of Syrah, Merlot, Petite Sirah and Zinfandel. The texture is soft, and the flavors are rich and ripe in cherries, currants and spicy, umami teriyaki. Earns an extra point for sheer likeability."
Red Blend,"This massive blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot is packed tight with cinnamon, clove and Christmas spice lavished over a solid core of blackberry and plum. The wine shows a ripe, jammy finish with a long, fruity fade."
Red Blend,"This five-grape blend is harmonious, with aromas of sweet spice, ripe berry, cherry, licorice and mineral. It's racy, deep and powerful, with dark berry, black plum and oaky, spicy flavors. It's long, elegant and potent on the finish. Drink through 2018."

Flavors of mixed black fruits, cocoa, toast and schisty mineral finish in a swirl of chocolate, blackened toast, licorice and peppercorn. Best from 2015–2018."
Red Blend,"Spicy, herbaceous aromas, fresh flavors and a nicely crisp and lightly tannic texture make this medium-bodied wine versatile. It's light enough to drink at lunch or before dinner and it's well-balanced enough to go with lots of different kinds of food. Its name is a nod to super Tuscan wines, since this blend contains Montepulciano and Sangiovese grapes, among others."
Red Blend,"What sets Gaja's super Tuscan apart is the extraordinary softness it offers both on the nose and in the mouth. The wine's aromas are cushiony and round, including milk chocolate, smooth cherry and silky spice. It tastes like liquid chocolate in the mouth and follows up with plump tannins and chewy succulence."

Red Blend,"This appealing red starts with a nose bursting with exotic tobacco, cocoa and red berries, followed by a juicy palate of black fruit, cocoa and sweet smoke. The oak is obvious here, offering vanilla and spicy notes, but the round fruit character keeps the wine in check. Elegant and fun."

Red Blend,"This full-bodied wine packs a lot of punch in terms of mouthfeel and flavor. The color is extremely dark, and the flavors resemble dark chocolate, black cherries and baking spices. It is dry in style, with lip-smacking, nicely astringent tannins that counterbalance all that richness."
Red Blend,"Peppery and harsh, but fully dry, with a hot, angular mouthfeel framing flavors of berries and mint."
Red Blend,A food-friendly blend of Schiava and Lagrein (two native grapes of northern Italy) this ruby-colored wine opens with a lean consistency and medium build. It shows cool-climate aromas of small forest fruit and blue flowers with a touch of white almond on the close.
Red Blend,"This is a spaghetti with tomato sauce wine, high in acidity, with very ripe, sweet cherry and cured tobacco flavors and firm tannins. It's kind of like an old fashioned Chianti."
Red Blend,"Made with Corvina, Corvinone, Rondinella and Molinara, this offers aromas of violet, red-skinned berry and nutmeg. The bright, straightforward palate offers red cherry, raspberry and clove alongside silky tannins and refreshing acidity. Enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"Dark, dusty, strongly scented with barrel toast, coffee grounds and incense, this is the most substantial and complete version to date. Balancing cherry and plum fruit against the pretty barrel-infused tannins, it glides gracefully across the palate into a seamless finish.   Saggi is the Long Shadows collaboration with Tuscany's Ambrogio and Giovanni Folonari. the blend in 2007 is 43% Sangiovese, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon and 21% Syrah. With each new vintage, the percentage of Sangiovese climbs, putting more Tuscany in this new world super-Tuscan wine. Dark, dusty, strongly scented with barrel toast, coffee grounds and incense, this is the most substantial and complete version to date. Balancing cherry and plum fruit against the pretty barrel-infused tannins, it glides gracefully across the palate into a seamless finish."
Red Blend,"Gritty, stalky aromas override the wine's plum and berry scents. This feels acidic and rough, with abrasive tannins. Thus the flavors are tight, juicy and narrow, with an emphasis on red fruits. Minerality and acidity drive the finish."
Red Blend,"This blend of Zinfandel, Syrah and Sangiovese shows dense, dark notes of chocolate, boysenberry, leather, lavender and a sprig of mint on the nose. The tannins are chalky in texture, with a balance of blueberries and menthol tones."
Red Blend,"A woody jammy nose is lush and borders on raisiny. Stout, saturated and thick on the palate, this Cabernet blend from Curicó deals a broad swipe of giant blackberry, cassis and raisin flavors. A chunky finish with rubbery tannins is tasty and lush, but a bit over the top."
Red Blend,"Rusty in color, this maturing Tannat-led blend smells warm, earthy, raisiny and like molasses. It's a bit wiry, rough and acidic on the palate, while raisin, baking spice and woody flavors end short and pile on with raisiny ripeness. Drink now."
Red Blend,"A blockbuster wine with finely tuned renderings of coffee, tobacco, spice and leather, Oreno requires a rare steak cooked on a mesquite grill or something similarly big and bold. In the mouth, this Sangiovese-Merlot-Cabernet blend delivers loads of spice that leaves a lasting impression thanks its firm tannins. Drink after 2010."
Red Blend,"This is a distinctive dessert wine that opens with an inky, dark ruby color and savory aromas of root beer, button mushroom, sun-dried fruit, prune and figs. The wine's sweet finish is dense and sticky."
Red Blend,"Aromas of black cherry, saddle leather and coffee prepare the palate for flavors of raspberry, cherry, mocha, and mountainside herbs. There is a pleasing balance of grippy tannins and bright acidity, with an especially zesty flash of cherry on the finish."
Red Blend,"Earthy aromas of tilled soil, underbrush, leather, purple flower, cedar and ripe black-skinned berry lead the way on this delicious blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot. The smooth full-bodied palate doles out juicy blackberry, red currant, licorice, exotic spice, mocha and a hint of game while tightly knit but velvety tannins lend both structure and finesse. It's already compelling but give it time to fully develop. Drink 2018–2027."
Red Blend,"Dry and tannic, with black cherry, blackberry, leather, cedar and peppery spice flavors. A tough, gritty wine that needs serious decanting."
Red Blend,"Heavy, raisiny, ripe aromas of prune and earthy blackberry set up a chewy, oaky, mildly tannic palate that's fully stuffed with woody, baked, almost malty flavors of blackberry, chocolate and toast. This is a rich, ripe number, with a loamy, toasty finish that shows black licorice and jammy cassis flavors. Drink through 2018."
Red Blend,"This is a 50-50 blend of estate-grown Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in neutral oak. Dark, plush, well-ripened fruit is the focus of a wine still a bit stiff and steely. It's classic in the way a Bordeaux is classic, firm and confidently blended."
Red Blend,"A blend of 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Syrah, 17% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this has aromas of French oak and black-skinned fruit. The dense palate delivers plum, toast and a hint of chocolate alongside rather abrasive tannins."
Red Blend,"This high-octane wine smells like Port, honey and black figs. It tastes very ripe, almost hot, feels quite tannic and heavy, and has a touch of sweetness to redeem it. Enjoy this as an after-dinner drink with chocolate or a cigar."
Red Blend,"This is a simple yet well made Chianti Classico with fresh and juicy black fruit, cinnamon spice and dense plum aromas and flavors. It's accessible and versatile for pairing with food; try it with barbecued chicken, spicy soy burgers or pork chops."
Red Blend,"This robust red opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, scorched earth and dark cooking spice. The warm, forward palate offers black cherry marinated in spirits and licorice accompanied by ripe, velvety tannins. Unfortunately, the heat of searing alcohol throws it off balance and dominates the palate."
Red Blend,"Made with Prugnolo Gentile, the local name for Sangiovese, and Canaiolo, this easygoing but delicious wine delivers juicy flavors of wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It's fresh with a moderately tannic structure. Drink through 2016."
Red Blend,"Initially, this comes across as being baked out and tired, but give it time to spread out and it reveals mature, earthy, leafy aromas and a round palate with choppy, firm tannins. Earthy flavors of dried cherry, Christmas spices and chocolate yield to licorice on the finish. Drink now."
Red Blend,"A blend of Nebbiolo, Barbera and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is deeply concentrated, offering pretty aromas of cherry, spice and cola. The 40% Nebbiolo is definitely noticeable—thanks to the wine's delicate bouquet. The 30% Barbera adds to the soft finish."
Red Blend,"Like it's bigger sibling El Anejón, this Reserva from a warm vintage is almost one-quarter Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in addition to Tinto Fino (Tempranillo). The opening of burnt earth, brandied cherry, rubber and herbal aromas is distinct. This feels a bit tough and chewy, with boysenberry, cassis, vanilla-cream and herbal spice flavors. A fairly smooth finish is young and vital. This should improve with aging. Best from 2019–2026."
Red Blend,"This wine is a blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot and 5% Syrah. It offers roasty-toasty aromas of dark coffee, bittersweet chocolate, char and cherry. The palate is appealing and silky in texture, showing elegant styling but with a lot of flavor intensity, followed by a lengthy finish. It's a pleasing mix of grace and power, barrel and fruit."
Red Blend,"The price on this wine is laughable, but the quality is excellent. Earthy aromas of lead pencil, baked plum, cassis and black cherry include chocolate and minerality. The palate is rich, jammy and a touch stewy, with herbal blackberry, cassis, chocoalte and coffee flavors. Even more chocolate and licorice rise up on the long finish. Put this away until 2015, then drink through 2024."
Red Blend,"Narrow, pointed aromas of licorice and snappy, herbal fruits filter into a hard, tannic palate. Flavors of red berries and currants are pushed by blazing acidity, while the finish is firm as rocks and tastes a bit green and minty. For a 2005, this is showing its cards; drink now."
Red Blend,"Vintner Riccardo Cotarella's fantastic Cabernet-based Marciliano (both Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc are present) opens with an intense bouquet of red fruit, blackberry, oak spice and chocolate. The ripeness level is spot-on; and the wine leaves a smooth, soft sensation in the mouth that's followed by firm, age-worthy tannins."

Red Blend,"Inky garnet in the glass, this wine offers aromas of black cherry and bell pepper. Fruit, cooling herb and spice flavors coexist peacefully on the palate, with hearty doses of cassis, black cherry, licorice, eucalyptus, chili flakes and bell pepper. Strong but smooth tannins never overcome a nice sense of fruity brightness that lingers on the palate."
Red Blend,"Closed with a pretty glass cork, Invetro (translated as “in glass” in Italian) offers fresh tones of wild berry and raspberry. This easy, lively red blend would match succulent meat or spicy pork."
Red Blend,"This blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, easily recognizable for its fun label showing antique cars and cyprus trees, has earthy aromas that suggest leafy underbrush, wet soil, woodland berries and plum. The palate delivers black cherry accented with black pepper, espresso and menthol. Tightly woven and tannic, it will benefit with a few more years aging. Drink 2015–2019."
Red Blend,"A blend of Syrah (80%), Cabernet Sauvignon (14%) and Mourvèdre, this opens with aromas of wet gravel, herb, smoke, funk, nori and black olive that are followed by plentiful, soft, generous savory flavors that bring a lot of intensity and appeal. The finish lingers."
Red Blend,"This opens with aromas of blue flower, ripe woodland berry and a whiff of pressed powder. The robust palate doles out juicy black cherry, mature plum, licorice and savory herb alongside firm, velvety tannins. It's concentrated and already accessible but will offer drinking pleasure for the next several years. Drink through 2021."
Red Blend,"A blend of Syrah, Merlot and Malbec, this wine has aromas of berry, cocoa and vanilla. The cranberry and cherry flavors are tart and full flavored with a velvety feel."
Red Blend,"There are copious amounts of earth and herbs on the nose of this blend of 28% Merlot, 28% Sangiovese, 22% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Carmenere, 6% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot, showing baked earth, red bell pepper and leather. It's soft and easy on the palate, with red fruit and that peppery pyrazine touch, making for a solid weeknight pizza wine."
Red Blend,"A blend of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with delicate blackberry and violet aromas. The palate delivers wild cherry, cedar and star anise flavors, braced by firm tannins. Enjoy through 2020."
Red Blend,"Wiry on the nose, with herbal, punchy, slightly strained red fruit aromas that suggest rhubarb. The palate is amorphous and standard, with lightly baked, mildly stewy blackberry and herbal flavors. On the finish, it's pure tobacco, chocolate and coffee. Syrah, Carignan, Carmenère and Petit Verdot."
Red Blend,"Made of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 5% Canaiolo, this opens with subtle floral and black fruit aromas. It's a simple red, showing cherry and clove flavors, framed by relaxed tannins. Enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"This is a lively and structured blend that integrates Tannat with Merlot and Petit Verdot. With 11 months in French oak, toasted coffee and tobacco notes ride over ripe cherry, plum and currant aromas. The tannins are sandy on the palate, giving ample structure to a dark fruit-driven wine. Freshly crushed black pepper lingers on the finish."
Red Blend,"Ripe cherry and raspberry aromas are accented by red flower and light turmeric tones. Lissome and juicy, the palate is robed with fine powdery tannins that lend the finish some toehold."
Red Blend,"Leather and citrus aromas unleash a mild chemical note on the nose of this Monastrell-Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A solid palate with hard, poking tannins leads to cherry flavors that veer towards bitterness. This finishes woody, dry and slightly bitter."
Red Blend,"Aromas of dark berry, cedar and allspice take shape in the glass. The straightforward, medium-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and espresso alongside round, ripe tannins. Drink through 2017."
Red Blend,"A hearty blend of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this bottling packs a wallop of cinnamon-stick on the nose as well as strawberry puree, licorice and black pepper. Clove, allspice, and nutmeg arise immediately on the sip, backed by baked plum and bay leaf notes."

Red Blend,This medium-bodied wine has ripe and semisweet flavors like cherry juice and plum jam that give a soft impression on the palate.
Red Blend,"Hints of charred wood and fresh-cracked black pepper meet tasty baked-fruit flavors in this full-bodied, rather rugged wine made from Grenache, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a good, firm and moderately tannic texture."
Red Blend,"This is the costliest of Stolpman's new reds and easily the best. It impresses for the depth of flavor and classic, dense structure. A co-fermented blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, it shows imposingly complex layers of dark stone fruits and berries, dark chocolate, bacon, dusty Indian spices and sweet, smoky sandalwood, wrapped into powerfully rich but gently ground tannins. Very fine, approaching the profound. Now–2013 before it loses freshness."
Red Blend,"An excellently priced blend of 70% Zinfandel, 14% Syrah, 11% Petite Sirah and 5% Grenache, this shows crystallized raspberry and rose petals on the nose. The palate offers light cranberry and pomegranate fruit, boosted by black and white pepper. This bottling has lots of life and energy, but it's drinking great now."
Red Blend,"Structured and polished, this opens with aromas that recall dark berry, leather, blue flowers, toasted oak, mint and spice. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, espresso, cedar, menthol and licorice alongside assertive but refined tannins. Drink 2016–2021."

Red Blend,"A blend of Sangiovese and Merlot, this shows great balance and loads of food-friendly nuances of cherry, spice and chocolate. Bright acidity keeps the palate refreshed."
Red Blend,"This nicely structured Bordeaux blend's aromas begin with violets and roll into cherry candy, while in the mouth the wine is sweet yet firm, with tart acids that are tightly wound. A mix of berry, cherry and cassis fruit is counterweighted with citric acids. Tannins are ripe with hints ofcut tobacco, moist earth and black olive."
Red Blend,"Inky red-violet to the eye, this blend of 55% Syrah, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot has a nose of black cherry and cherry cola. Brisk acidity compensates for powerful tannins, with flavors of black cherry, cassis, anisette and eucalyptus."

Creamy but firmly textured, like crushed velvet, with a rich boysenberry and plum juiciness to the palate."
Red Blend,"This blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah opens with oak-driven aromas of hard spices and briny berry fruits. The palate is wiry and juicy in feel, with pointed acidity. Baked berry flavors plus strong notes of clove and nutmeg finish spicy, with a lasting blend of cocoa and saltiness."
Red Blend,"Here's an inky dark wine, with aromas of plum, leather and forest floor. The palate offers ripe black-fruit flavors, richened further by oak, chocolate, vanilla and café au lait sensations. It closes with drying wood tannins."
Red Blend,"This opens with aromas of mature black-skinned berry, leather, menthol and dark spice. The palate seems a bit older than it is, offering raisin, bitter prune and star anise alongside close-grained but not very persistent tannins."
Red Blend,"Blueberry, vanilla and cedar aromas start this rich, luxuriant red. On the palate, savory cigarbox and caramel flavors meld with bright red fruits and sweet vanilla. The wine finishes dry and will pair beautifully with lamb and beef dishes."
Red Blend,"This blend of 70% Sangiovese with Canaiolo, Colorino, Ciliegiolo and Malvasia shows fruity berry and violet aromas. On the palate, juicy black plum fruit is laced with baking spice and structured by smooth tannins. Enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"Interesting and very much showing Navarran qualities, including aromas of black olive, herbs and mossy fruit. The palate has good structure, balance and feel, and thus there's a nice platform for dry black cherry, cassis and mocha flavors. As an '05 it's evolved, still fresh enough, and ready to go."

Red Blend,"The nose on this Romanian blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Feteasca Neagra is dark and smoky with charred oak, coffee and tobacco melding into an herbaceous, woody backdrop. Juicy black plums and cherries are offset by strong grape and wood tannins and notes of cigar smoke and black pepper on the palate. It's fine now, but a year or two in the cellar might smooth out some jagged edges."
Red Blend,"Aromas of moist underbrush, saddle leather, dried herb, menthol and a whiff of game take shape in the glass. The firm palate offers raw sour cherry, cranberry, cinnamon and a hint of tobacco while close-grained tannins provide the framework and leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink."
Red Blend,"This fresh Amarone offers an inviting fragrance of perfumed berry and exotic spice. Notes of graphite, black pepper and clove give depth to the ripe plum and blackberry flavors. It's balanced with firm, chewy tannins. Drink through 2019."
Red Blend,"The fresh bouquet of this blend shows feminine notes of blue flower and light spice. The aromas are a bit raw at this stage, and there's a touch of cherry-like sourness on the close."
Red Blend,"Black pepper, wild cherry and charred-earth aromas follow over to the light-bodied palate along with a hint of salt. It's lively and enjoyable, with lithe tannins. Drink soon."
Red Blend,"Balifico's build and concentration grow on the palate offering aromas of cherry, rum, vanilla, cloves, lead, incense, candle wax and Asian spice along the way. The blend of Sangiovese and Cab delivers complexity, drying tannins and smoky overtones."
Red Blend,"This smells big but flat, with rich, jammy scents of berry and cherry. The palate comes across heavy and grabby.

Red Blend,"Primary aromas of grapeseed and blueberry are mixed with touches of old clove and dried tobacco on the nose of this blend. Dusty and dried fruit flavors show most intensely on the sip, with extremely strong gingerbread spice."
Red Blend,"The name refers to the blend of 62% Barbera and 38% Nebbiolo sourced from a pair of Horse Heaven Hills vineyards. A little high-toned on the nose, the wine eventually smoothes out in the glass, and it offers pretty flavors of raspberry and Bing cherry. Succulent and nicely balanced, this is one of the better Washington examples of these two grapes."
Red Blend,"Jammy aromas of raisin and baking spices are a touch herbal. This kitchen-sink blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carignan, Garnacha, Petit Verdot and Tempranillo feels rugged and grating. Classic Chilean flavors of reedy plum, berry and tomato end with a minty green note and a touch of fennel."
Red Blend,"There is a ton of black pepper flavor in this stylish blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah. It also bears notes of licorice, sweet red currants, grilled prosciutto and sandalwood. This tastes so rich that it almost seems sweet, but it's actually dry and balanced."
Red Blend,"Rusty in color, this maturing Tannat-led blend smells warm, earthy, raisiny and like molasses. It's a bit wiry, rough and acidic on the palate, while raisin, baking spice and woody flavors end short and pile on with raisiny ripeness. Drink now."
Red Blend,"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance."
Red Blend,"Loaded with personality and special distinguishing qualities, this blend of Nocera, Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio is a wine for those interested in Italy's indigenous grapes. The bouquet is complex and layered with notes of bramble, forest berry, cassis, cola, dried ginger and green curry. The mouthful is tight, structured and streamlined."
Red Blend,"Made from a blend of Corvina, Syrah and Oseleta, this savory wine is made by one of Amarone's leading producers. It offers red currant, bell pepper and black pepper flavors. It's tightly wound but fresh, and would pair nicely with grilled portobello mushrooms."

Red Blend,"Ripe plum, spiced blueberry, cedar, toasted oak and tobacco are some of the aromas you'll find in this structured blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. The full-bodied palate delivers blackberries, black currants, clove, espresso, ground pepper and licorice while assertive but fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink 2016–2025."
Red Blend,"A Zinfandel-based blend, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec, this wine is hearty, thick and dense. It traffics in smoky char, leathery tannins and a strong taste of tobacco, finishing with a flash of red plum."
Red Blend,Passo del Lupo (85% Montepulciano with Sangiovese for extra acidity) is aged two years in oak but is nonetheless a strange wine with candied aromas of cassis and raspberry lollipop. It's a curiosity that might not appeal to everyone.
Red Blend,"Aromas of dark berry, clove, bell pepper and cedar take shape in the glass. The tightly wound palate delivers dried black cherry, espresso, oak and a green note of dried sage alongside astringent tannins. While the tannins need time, the fruit is already starting to dry up."
Red Blend,"Rich and fruity, this structured wine, still young, is firm and dense. Juicy black fruits are layered with acidity and given a solid character by the concentrated tannin core. Drink from 2017."
Red Blend,"Brambly red-fruit aromas mix with notes of sweet milk chocolate and dust. It feels crisp, tight and fresh, with raspberry and lightly herbal plum flavors. This finishes taut and fruity. A blend of 75% Garnacha and 25% Tempranillo."
Red Blend,"A pretty mineral note appears at the very beginning of this Sangiovese-Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend and is followed by ripe fruit flavors and a touch of caper or green olive. The wine is rich and plush, with a long-lasting finish."
Red Blend,"Ripe and broad shouldered, this blend of Zinfandel, Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon is full in flavor and tannins. It's a perfect pizza wine."
Red Blend,"Bulky, stewy, jammy aromas of prune and raisin are an accurate indication of what's to come. This is pure prune juice, with mushy weight and sweet, syrupy flavors. Fig, raisin and chocolate flavors pop up on the finish, but overall this is soupy and drastically overripe."
Red Blend,"A blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, this wine shows a mild concentration of ripe raspberry and bramble berry on the nose. The medium-weight palate is soft in feel, with juicy raspberry and red cherry showing a slight undercurrent of green peppercorns. A toasted praline note marks the close."
Red Blend,"A touch scratchy on the bouquet, with a red berry aroma and a wild herb note. It feels fresh and decidedly “red” in style, with red plum and red currant flavors. More easygoing than brooding, this finishes light. Drink now through 2015."

The chewy palate delivers ripe black cherry, juicy blackberry, ground clove and dried Mediterranean herb alongside round, enveloping tannins that give it a velvety texture."
Red Blend,"A different breed of blended wine, with earthy aromas of dried cheese, leather, dill and vanilla. The palate is tight and mildly tannic, with sweet cola, roasted berry and earthy tobacco flavors. Not your normal bulky, dark wine; it's complex and based on 85% Garnacha and Carignan."
Red Blend,"The percentage of Grenache has been bumped up in Rôtie's second vintage, now at 70%, with the rest an even split between Syrah and Mourvèdre. Soft and spicy scents are laced with a mix of rock and vanilla. This nicely structured yet approachable wine might be mistaken for a Washington take on Priorat. The underlying minerality gives the light, plummy fruit a solid footing, and extends the length considerably."
Red Blend,"This blend of Merlot and Cabernet has aromas of bell pepper, black currant and a hint of cedar wood. The palate shows one-dimensional flavors of plum, black currant and oak."
Red Blend,"A blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Malvasia and Merlot, it has aromas of underbrush and tobacco leaf alongside notes of espresso and spice. The linear palate offers black cherry accented by notes of nutmeg and black pepper, with firm but rather fleeting tannins."
Red Blend,"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with earthy aromas of wet soil, underbrush and a whiff of barnyard. The simple palate offers overripe black cherry and a funky note of game alongside soft tannins."
Red Blend,"Made with 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot, this has a shy nose, eventually revealing whiffs of black-skinned fruit and scorched earth. The subdued rather evolved palate suggests dried black cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside mellow tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining freshness."
Red Blend,"From Paso's blending vanguards, this mix of 62% Syrah, 19% Petite Sirah, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Malbec offers an intriguing nose of sesame, soy, cracked pepper, fresh blackberry and raw beef. There is cedar and toasted pine on the palate as well as smoked meats, black pepper, teriyaki and an elderberry-blackberry base."
Red Blend,"Magno Megonico, from Calabria in the deep south of Italy, is an edgy, sharp wine with a pointed vein of acidity that carries through the end. That natural freshness and 14% alcohol helps underline the wine's aromas of raspberry and forest fruit. Pair this wine with a fatty food cooked with butter or cheese."
Red Blend,"This is a dark, dense blend of 52% Syrah, 30% Merlot and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of cassis, blackberry and plum lead on the bouquet, with background accents of tree bark and forest floor. The firm structure and gripping tannins are softened by ripe black-fruit flavors that carry through to the lingering finish. Balanced but young, this should develop greater complexity and nuance with time; drink 2016–2020."
Red Blend,"Here's an interesting blend of Corvina, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rondinella that reflects the aromas and power of each grape variety. The wine offers mature notes of cherry, clove, blackberry and cola: It tastes slightly sweet and very succulent."
Red Blend,"Ripe and on the cusp of being classified as “raisiny,” but in the final analysis this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo from one of the Penedès' best cava producers has plenty of appeal. Look for sweet, friendly plum, cassis and prune flavors sitting on a saturated, cuddly palate. Drink soon to capture the wine's livelier qualities; further aging will not help it."

Red Blend,"Lots of pepper and spice in this dry, briary red blend. Could be Zinfandel, except it's not. The components are Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. A good value for a wine this complex and delicious."
Red Blend,"Principally Malbec, with 18% Tempranillo filling out the blend, this tangy and appealing wine wraps its red currant fruit in streaks of vanilla, tobacco and light herbs."
Red Blend,"Made with 34% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Colorino, this has a restrained nose, eventually revealing aromas of black-skinned fruit and baking spice. The one-dimensional straightforward palate offers suggestions of plum, oak and a hint of coffee alongside fleeting tannins. Enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"Easy-drinking, rich and mouth-filling, this wine is a winner from start to finish. It has red cherry and dill aromas, ripe plum and cherry flavors and a supple texture. Light on tannin and full in body, it's generous and satisfying to drink."
Red Blend,"This pretty red has an alluring fragrance of iris, violet, brown spice and crushed berry. The easygoing palate offers juicy black cherry, white pepper and a hint of espresso while lithe tannins lend support."
Red Blend,"This wine has traveled miles in the right direction compared to its early incarnations. It's piercing and potent up front, with cigar box, mocha, toast and coffee aromas in addition to fine flavors of tobacco, cassis, vanilla and lightly baked berry and cassis. Finishes wavy and long; 50% Syrah along with Merlot, Cab and Carmenère."
Red Blend,"With each successive vintage, winemaker Gus Janeway has slowly but surely moved this wine to 100% Malbec. It's a bold step, because pure varietal wines do not have the advantage of filling in holes with blending. But for those who want to glimpse the future of Malbec in southern Oregon, this is a touch point. Delicate, balanced, herbal, mixing a wash of light fruits with nuances of herb, this very drinkable wine has appealing delicacy and verve."
Red Blend,"Enticing aromas of crushed black cherry, mature plum, black pepper, blue flower and tilled earth lead the nose on this vibrant, full-bodied wine. Rich blackberry, clove, espresso and black pepper back up the palate alongside firm tannins. It ends on a licorice note. Drink 2016–2025."
Red Blend,"Malbec makes up just under two-thirds of this wine, with the balance Syrah. Quite pure fruit-forward aromas of blue fruit, herb and clove lead to a sweet plush rich palate that shows good midpalate density. The finish lingers."
Red Blend,"Aroma of freshly cut red apple, raspberry and cherry are followed by sweet jammy red and black-fruit flavors. It goes down easily."
Red Blend,"This is stylish and smooth up front, with tobacco, graphite, cedar and herbal notes to the bouquet. The mouthfeel is a bit jammy and chewy, with chocolate, licorice, mocha and blackberry flavors. A mild, creamy finish chugs along with coffee notes and ripe black-fruit flavors. Drink now through 2017."
Red Blend,"This red blend features a nose of raspberry, fennel bulb, oregano and lavender. Mouth-pleasing flavors of ripe cherry, anise, orange zest and anise are wrapped in smooth tannins. It is full in the mouth, offering a lingering finish punctuated by a burst of pomegranate."
Red Blend,"Herbal, peppery and high-toned, with hairspray notes that detract from the ample blackberry and plum flavors. Disappointing."
Red Blend,"This blend of Merlot, Tannat and Syrah comes from the southwest near the Atlantic Ocean. That locale gives the tannins and the juicy red fruits a cool, perfumed and lightly stalky character. The acidity is right there along with the soft berry aftertaste that makes the wine drinkable now."
Red Blend,"Smooth and juicy, this opens with aromas of wild berry, blue flower and a whiff of grilled herb. The soft, succulent palate doles out black cherry, chopped mint, cinnamon and a hint of mocha alongside dusty tannins and bright acidity. It's rather straightforward but delicious."
Red Blend,"Don't let the evil-eye label scare you off. An earthy, beefy flavor gives this dry and medium-bodied wine a bit of an unusual but attractive personality. It feels firm and well-balanced on the palate, with good acidity and firm tannins."
Red Blend,"Subertum is a blend of Merlot, Syrah and Petit Verdot that exhibits fine aromas of spice, smoked meat, leather, milk chocolate, coffee grinds, black fruit and plum. Tones of spice and leather are recognizable and the wine delivers chewy tannins and a somewhat rustic feeling."
Red Blend,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot split the blend with 8% Syrah in addition. The opening scents are toasty and inviting, and the wine enters the palate smooth and agreeable, with pretty red fruits. There's a lick of licorice and then the flavors seem to lighten up and finish tart and astringent. But decant this and let it breathe, and the wine can surprise with its staying power."
Red Blend,"This blend of Blaufränkisch, Syrah and Merlot is Höpler's signature wine. It makes for a fascinating combination of ripe black-plum flavors highlighted by juicy acidity and wood notes. The wine will age well, so drink from 2015. Screwcap."
Red Blend,"The convergence of high alcohol, acidity and tannin will make this Super Tuscan-style blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot last quite a while. Intense plum brandy aromas meet nose-tickling licorice notes on the nose while the palate's grippy tannins present vanilla, cherry, blackberry and candied lilac flavors. Drink 2018–2028."
Red Blend,"Like many Navarran wines, this Garnacha-Tempranillo blend offers equal parts earthy spice and dry fruit. Aromas of spearmint, leather and wood spice bump up against crisp, wiry red-fruit notes, and the palate holds that line. If you want a restrained, balanced, more traditonal Spanish wine to drink with food, this is a good bet."
Red Blend,"Aromas of bright berry, blue flower and savory herb lead the nose. The palate offers raw cherry, espresso, oak and anise alongside bracing, rather astringent tannins."
Red Blend,"Aromas of toasted nut, vanilla nougat, orange, spice and lemon lead this sophisticated sip from Loel. On the palate, spice, smoke, nut and citrus flavors intermingle in an elegant but assertive package. This is an appealing and historic treat."
Red Blend,"Aromas of grilled herb, French oak, scorched earth and menthol lead the nose. The juicy, accessible palate offers Morello cherry, vanilla, orange peel and a hint of mocha alongside fine-grained but rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2017."
Red Blend,"This is a genuine and straightforward red wine from Piedmont that would pair with oven-roasted pasta or meat loaf. The wine (made from Nebbiolo and 20% Vespolina) is lean and fresh in the mouth, but ends with a very focused blast of almond and marzipan like flavors."
Red Blend,"Half Malbec and half Petit Verdot, the barrel notes of vanilla and pencil lead play off cherry and purple flowers with citrusy acidity and firm, dry tannins providing the frame."
Red Blend,"Floral soupy plum aromas come with notes of road tar, violet, lavender and grass. This has a jammy, saturated, chunky mouthfeel to go with plum and spiced-berry flavors. Exotic notes of cardamom and clove are key to a spicy finish. This is a blend of Monastrell, Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon."
Red Blend,"Subtle and soft, this aromatic Bordeaux blend (54% Cab Sauvignon, 9% Carmenère, 9% Merlot, 10% Malbec, 18% Petit Verdot) is laced with herb and exotic and savory spices, woven through tight fruit flavors of blueberry and musky grape. This is a delicate, evocative and challenging wine that rewards your attention. Fascinating and complex, it needs time to breathe and good glassware to really open up."
Red Blend,"Made of 70% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this offers black currant and vanilla aromas. The dense, approachable palate delivers ripe black plum and toasty tobacco flavors, pulled taut by firm tannins. Drink through 2019."
Red Blend,"The old vines from this estate that has been run by the same family for 10 generations have produced a firm wine, with structure and tannins that still need to soften. It is rich and juicy with black fruits and wood aging toastiness. The wine, named after the 1780 Royal Edict that established this small appellation on the banks of the Garonne river between Bordeaux and Toulouse is worth aging longer, so wait to drink until 2018."
Red Blend,"This is a big, full-bodied and nicely balanced wine, with hefty blackberry and cherry flavors matched to a firm texture of rich acidity and fine-grained tannins."
Red Blend,"There's a tough, peppery leatheriness to this wine that's by no means undistinguished. Bone dry, with firm tannins, it's more European than Californian in style, with hints of dried berry, charred meat bone, earth, herb and spice. It shows real control and nerve. The blend is Syrah and Petite Sirah."
Red Blend,"A tough, gritty wine, dry and tannic, with some decent berry and cherry flavors. It's the kind of red wine that will happily wash down a cheeseburger."
Red Blend,"The meaty, spicy aromas of this medium-bodied wine are quickly followed by a flood of ripe, grapy fruit flavors that seem lightly sweet as they coat the sides of the mouth. It's big in flavor and rather soft and easy in texture."
Red Blend,"This Cabernet Sauvingon, Syrah and Merlot dominant blend offers aromas of wet copper, zesty spice and herb that are followed by a silky soft, flavorful palate. It brings a lot of easy-drinking pleasure."
Red Blend,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this delivers soft, concentrated flavors of chocolate fudge, cherry and cinnamon spice. It's an irresistible, opulent wine that promises to impress."
Red Blend,"This opens with funky aromas of leather, game, overripe plum and a whiff of barnyard. The aromas all carry over to the rustic palate along with dried black cherry while raspy, fleeting tannins give it an abrupt, astringent finish."
Red Blend,"Underbrush, blackberry, blue flower and mocha lead the nose on this blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. The dense palate offers cassis, black cherry, black pepper, espresso and licorice alongside youthfully assertive tannins. Drink 2016–2021."
Red Blend,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. The aromas of spice, cherry and plum are quite reserved while the palate brings plump fruit and barrel flavors backed by grainy tannins."
Red Blend,"This blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Sangiovese opens with aromas of crushed blackberry, ripe plum and blue flowers. On the palate, notes of anise and black pepper accent the core of fleshy black cherry while assertive but polished tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2016–2019."
Red Blend,"Baked plum, exotic spice and chocolate aromas almost jump out of the glass. The brawny palate doles out prune, blackberry jam, licorice and tobacco alongside round, velvety tannins. A raisin note backs up the finish."
Red Blend,"A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon and 35% Merlot, this is a landmark bottling because many years ago it demonstrated that great international-style wines could be made elsewhere in Italy—not only in Tuscany. A celebrated star of the Veneto, this oak-aged red offers enormous density and intensity, with soft, velvety layers and bright aromas of red fruit, spice and dried sage. The finish is characterized by savory, herbal notes that are fresh and tantalizing."
Red Blend,"A blend of 60% Corvina, 20% Rondinella, 10% Corvinone and 10% Negrara, this offers delicate aromas suggesting black-skinned berry and cooking spice. The firm palate evokes blackberry jam, tobacco and green pepper alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy through 2021."
Red Blend,"A hint of earthiness accents this medium-bodied, moderately tannic and berry-flavored wine. It smells savory and leathery, and tastes like raspberries and blackberries."
Red Blend,"This is a masculine blend of Montepulciano and Cabernet Sauvignon, for structure, color and tannins, and Sangiovese, for delicate aromas. Coffee, leather, tobacco and sweet cherry are woven within the wine's succulent, meaty consistency."
Red Blend,"A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Canaiolo, it opens with aromas of violet, raspberry and spice. The juicy, forward palate delivers black cherry accented with notes of white pepper and espresso."
Red Blend,"Juicy red and blue fruit stars in this straightforward Cab-based blend. It offers a soft, medium-bodied personality and approachable tannins."
Red Blend,"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon with 40% Merlot is youthfully exuberant and full of life. Plum aromas lead into pencil and clove, the fruit at first subdued in order to make way for the complexity of savory seasonings. Ready to enjoy, it packs a refined punch of leather on the finish."
Red Blend,"People will love this Cab Sauvignon-Merlot blend (60%-40%) that's got bright red fruit, mostly cherry and raspberry, finished with a tinge of cocoa."
Red Blend,"Pronounced like “Cyrano,” this blend of 63% Petite Sirah, 28% Pinot Noir and 9% Syrah successfully mingles these distinct varieties. Crushed mulberry, strawberry and black plum meet with thyme and mint-chocolate-chip aromas on the nose. The palate shows similar flavors, yet is more subtle than a typical Petite Sirah, with a plush mouthfeel."
Red Blend,"With glittering diamonds encrusted in the glass of the bottle, Diadema would make a beautiful presentation at an elegant dinner. A blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, this opens with modern tones of black fruit, chocolate and spice. The mouthfeel is smooth, long and rich."
Red Blend,"This expensive wine is softly tannic, earthy and fruity, with dried herb and raspberry tea flavors. From Francis Ford Coppola."
Red Blend,"Balsam wood, floral berry and herbal aromas rest in front of a crisp, fresh palate with raw acidity and clampy tannins. Olive, pepper, herbal and foresty fruit flavors announce a medium-weight, snappy finish with no obvious oak. This is very nice but at $125 a bottle it has its limits."
Red Blend,"You'll find aromas of red and black berry, grilled sage, cedar and tobacco on this vibrant, elegantly structured blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot. The polished palate delivers red currants, black raspberries, white pepper and clove alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2016–2022."
Red Blend,"Smells and tastes like caramel and stewed cherry and blackberry flavors that taste overtly sweet. However, this rustic blend of Syrah and Sangiovese may have its fans."
Red Blend,"The Beckett brothers' 50-50 blend of Tempranillo and Zinfandel is one of their top wines, and it lives up to its reputation, with plump black cherry, baked plum and campfire aromas. The palate is softly layered with chalky tannins that carry waves of berry-powered acidity as well as savory notes of teriyaki, chocolate ganache and minty freshness on the finish."
Red Blend,"This five-grape, Garnacha-led blend captures the essence of Terra Alta with laser-focused aromas of blackberry, spice and stony minerality. A full, lively, acid-driven palate is balanced by creamy oak, while flavors of vanilla and coconut accent plum and berry fruit. Lasting acidity creates definition and length on the finish. Drink through 2020."

Red Blend,"This Amarone has a fragrance of blackberry, plum and oak, all of which carry over to the palate alongside notes of black licorice and pepper. You'll also detect a warm midpalate and warmth of alcohol on the close."
Red Blend,"The vineyard of the Giennois is close to the city of Orléans, making it the most northerly Loire vineyard. This wine with its cool, fresh character has a light tannic character and brings out red fruits as its biggest attraction. It has a fresh, crisp, juicy aftertaste. Drink now."
Red Blend,"Caburnio (mostly Cabernet Sauvignon) shows elegant aromas of blackberry pie, coffee, cinnamon cake and exotic spice. There's a tiny herbal or medicinal touch backed by tones of cola, leather and dried tobacco."
Red Blend,"A whiff of Graham cracker lends a warm, spicy tone to youthful black cherry and plum flavors in this bold blend that includes small proportions of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon. Lush and fruity on the palate, it maintains elegance with a vein of granite minerality and grippy, mouthfilling tannins."
Red Blend,"A blend of Syrah and Sangiovese, this salmon-colored wine opens with aromas of peach blossom and honeysuckle. The palate doles out juicy red cherry, nectarine, pink grapefruit and a hint of Mediterranean herb alongside zesty acidity."
Red Blend,"The aromas are clean, intense and penetrating and exhibit ripe black fruit with measured background shadings of spice, vanilla, toast and distant herbal tones. The blend of Syrah and Petit Verdot (with 25% other varieties) showcases the full beauty of its vintage in a feminine and understated way. But at the same time, this wine is determined and powerful."
Red Blend,"Aromas of cherry, spiced meat and plum start off this masculine red. Flavors of smoke, spice and red fruit are balanced and easy to embrace, and the wine offers ageable structure to boot. This is an impressive selection that will pair well with hearty dishes, but it will also be enjoyable on its own."
Red Blend,"Ripe and deep in berry, currant, cassis and spice flavors, with a rich overlay of cedary oak. Shows some roughness in midpalate and tannic astringency on the finish. Good, but edgy and a little harsh. Contains some Petite Sirah and Syrah."
Red Blend,"This wine is messy on the nose, where compost, gas and animal aromas blend with jammy berry scents. It feels tannic and clampy, with baked and rooty berry flavors. The wine remains roasted in style and rooty on the finish."
Red Blend,"Made with a blend of Mediterranean and Caucasian grape varieties, Jassarte shows a green note of medicinal herb with forest berry and bramble. The wine is tight, bright and nicely acidic on the close."
Red Blend,"Aromas of brick dust, vitamins and baked fruits are gritty and require some navigating. This has a wiry, tight feel, yet in terms of flavors, it's ripe almost to the point of being raisiny. Heat, hard tannins and dried berry fruit flavors direct the finish. Drink through 2017."
Red Blend,"This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry. With a mouthfeel like crushed velvet, a black pepper finish and an attractive price tag, it's a shame only 100 cases were produced."
Red Blend,"The blend here is Sangiovese (70%), Sagrantino and Merlot and the wine opens with an inky dark appearance followed by bulky tones of black cherry, cola and spice."
Red Blend,"Sunbaked plum and currant aromas are a touch spicy. In the mouth, this blend of 50% Monastrell, 25% Syrah and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon is full, tannic and mostly well balanced. Dense spicy plume and black-fruit plum flavors finish with rubbery grabby tannins."
Red Blend,"Cola, dark cherry and candied strawberry show on the nose of this blend of 33% Grenache, 34% Syrah and 33% Tempranillo. The palate offers root beer and cherry cola flavors, with ample amounts of anise, nutmeg and vanilla, its tannins needing time to soften."
Red Blend,"Robust on the bouquet, with ample red berry fruit and vanilla. The palate has a deep, layered feel and flavors of plum, berry and peppery spice. A tight blend of Carignan, Garnacha and Syrah that's forward and wiry, with power in reserve. Drink now through 2015."
Red Blend,"Hearty and masculine, this has dark fruit aromas of blackberry and prune that are backed by notes of cured meat, leather and Indian spice. Those dark flavors add sensations of sweetness and richness to the overall mouthfeel."
Red Blend,"Until now I've found this winery's offerings to be underwhelming, but this small-production blend is a surprising winner.

On the finish, it's stacked with juicy acidity and herbal berry leftovers. 200 cases made."
Red Blend,"Although this Syrah-led blend is earthy, roasted and slightly rustic-smelling with dried berry aromas, it is lively in the mouth, with good acidity. Flavors of cherry, cassis and plum finish round and healthy, with weight and concentration but also lift. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,"Aromas of black cherry, tobacco and exotic spice lead the nose of this wine. The palate is soft and ripe, with black cherry, prune and white pepper accents. A bit simple, but delicious, and ready to drink now."
Red Blend,"Sappy candied-cherry fruit aromas lead into a soft, easy-to-drink blend that's an unpretentious quaff for the backyard grill."
Red Blend,"Immediately this Syrah-led blend registers as something special. Ripe berry and herb aromas are spicy, fresh and textbook for Chile. A full, dense, chewy palate is potent but under control. Flavors of olive, spice, coffee, toast and dark fruits finish with barrel spice, a final wave of black-fruit flavor and notes of juniper and eucalyptus. Drink through 2021."
Red Blend,"This could be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon; the only other grape in the blend is a 14% Cab Franc component. Rich black cherry fruit provides the solid base, but after that the wine tightens down, so decanting would be essential if you plan to drink it soon. The scents weave together black fruits, spices and licorice; more than any of the other new releases from Soos Creek, this needs more time to settle."
Red Blend,"Spicy, mildly herbal aromas of cassis and red-berry fruits feed into a racy, fresh palate with vital acidity and excellent overall balance. Flavors of spice and berry fruits are persistent, while the finish is deep and feels right. This blend of Syrah, Cabernet and Carmenère is entirely pleasing. Drink through 2018."
Red Blend,"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (65%) and Barbera. Cranberry, raspberry and baking spice aromas are followed by generous tart fruit flavors with an electric jolt of acid. The acid is quite bracing to have on its own. Pair it with pasta with a red sauce."
Red Blend,"This wine from a prolific Sierra winery is dark in color, ripe and full in flavor, showing blackberry jam, chocolate and raspberry flavors while coating the palate with soft tannins and good concentration."

Tarry, gritty, asphalt-like aromas blend with smoky berry notes to form an inviting bouquet. The palate is round and juicy in feel, with herbal, minty red-berry flavors and a deep, flush finish that's showing a high level of complexity. Drink through 2018."
Red Blend,"Made with Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon in equal parts, this opens with aromas of violet, cedar, and underbrush. The medium-bodied palate delivers red currant, black pepper and anise alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,"Six different varieties are included in the blend, which varies from year to year. This is very open and fruity, a good, all-purpose red blend that is ready to drink right now. The palate impression is almost too soft, with a residual flavor of ripe bananas running through the finish."
Red Blend,"Earthy aromas of cola and baked berry fruits introduce a saturated, tannic mouthfeel that supports dark-berry flavors that turn more herbal, stalky and mulchy with airing. The more this sits in the glass, the more tannic and pushy it gets."
Red Blend,"Soft and a little warm in alcohol, this blend has rich flavors of red berries, red currants, smoked meat and exotic spices. It's an easy wine to drink with barbecue."
Red Blend,"This captivating wine treads the line between Rhône and Bordeaux. A splash of Cabernet, though just a fraction of the blend, stands out. The wine has depth and persistence, and the mix of grapes works well, showing brambly red fruits, like a Zin, spice and pepper, like Syrah, and some herbal and leafy tobacco in the finish. Complex, unique and quite appealing."
Red Blend,"This 60-40 super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese and Merlot offers a smooth and clean quality of berry fruit, cassis and raspberry. You'll also recognize spice, leather, tobacco and soft chocolate fudge on the close."
Red Blend,"The winery went all out on this blend of 50% Syrah, 25% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, giving it three years in 20% new French oak. It's a solid, chunky blend, bright and spicy, with high-toned cranberry and cherry fruit. It's good, but simple."
Red Blend,"Morar is a spicy Amarone with a fragrance of raisin, baked plum, tobacco and black pepper. The palate delivers lush black cherry and raspberry flavors mingled with intense white pepper, clove and nutmeg notes. It's smooth and rich with enough freshness to make this a perfect match for seasoned cheeses or roasted red meat."
Red Blend,"The Pannobile style is a blend of local varieties, this one dominated by Zweigelt. It's smooth and fruity, with soft tannins. There's a rustic edge to the fruit that gives some complexity. At the end, it's about the fresh berry acidity."
Red Blend,"Ripe enough in blackberries, currants and mocha, with an earthy, tobacco herbaceousness. The tannins are potent, making the wine hard. Drink now, after a good decanting."
Red Blend,"Aromas of dried berry, scorched soil and anisette lead the nose. The ripe palate offers spiced blackberry, juicy wild cherry, licorice, ground pepper and mineral alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and just enough freshness."
Red Blend,"Zinfandel (46%) takes the lead on this blend, with the rest Sangiovese, Blaufrankisch and Malbec. Aromas of jammy red fruit and herb lead to ripe, expressive fruit flavors. It brings a lot of appeal and has a lovely sense of balance."
Red Blend,"Earthy notes of underbrush, truffle, tilled soil and ripe plum lead the nose on this solid Vino Nobile. The straightforward palate offers crushed black cherry, raspberry, white pepper and a hint of licorice alongside fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2018."

The fresh savory palate offers strawberry, yellow peach, cinnamon, herb and a hint of fennel alongside crisp acidity. A salty mineral note drives the finish. More about mineral energy than fruit, it's a rosé for grown-ups."
Red Blend,"This is a distinctive red wine from Puglia marked by apple skin and floral notes of dried rosebud, black tea and green olive. It has depth and personality—and a touch of volatility—that leaves a fresh impression."
Red Blend,"This red blend has a nose of fresh cherry, red plum and clove. In the mouth, it offers a combination of fruit and spice flavors featuring anise, black plum, Chinese five spice, and black cherry. There is a burst of still-youthful acidity on the finish, but this should be drunk within the next year or two."
Red Blend,"There's a touch of Band-Aid or used leather that falls to the background the more the wine spends time in the glass. Cherry and white almond are the leading aromatic accents and this blend of Sangiovese (80%), Merlot and Cabernet is simple and fresh in the mouth."
Red Blend,"Made with air dried grapes, this fruity blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Corvina (a native grape of Veneto, northern Italy) opens with raw notes of cherry, blackberry and exotic spice. It's smooth and rich with a powerful blast of cherry on the close."
Red Blend,"There's a fresh, bright quality to this blend of Magliocco, Greco Nero and Malvasia grapes. It delivers aromas of crushed white pepper, prune and exotic spice."
Red Blend,"Sourced from what winemaker Don Corson calls “the best of the best”, this five-grape blend is modeled after Chateau St. Jean's Cinq Cépages. It shows a carefully sculpted frame, with rich, dark, smoky tannins chiseled into a tight foundation for the dark currant and black cherry fruit. Notes of pepper and spice add interest to the finish, which carries a hint of minerality."

Red Blend,"This is a new wine playing at Chile's high-priced, icon level. Fresh yet oaky on the nose, with aromas of herbs and char, this is layered, pure and smooth on the palate. Spice, oak and chocolate mix with berry and plum flavors, while the dry, long, oaky finish is on the money. Drink this well-crafted Cabernet blend through 2022."
Red Blend,"This Bordeaux blend (with some Syrah in the mix also) opens with dark, toasty, smoky scents underscoring sleek berry fruit. It's done in a somewhat lean style, but nicely balanced. Details of olive, tobacco, cedar and coffee run through the finish. The best Narcissa released so far."
Red Blend,"If all you're after is size, then sign on the dotted line. This blend is a monster that weighs in at 15.5%, so be ready for intensely sweet flavors of grape essence and licorice. To this judge, the wine has a lot of gumption but isn't what I'd want to drink glass after glass, day after day. It's lumbering, heavy but oh so sweet and dessert-like."
Red Blend,"Made from Sangiovese and a bit of Colorino, this has an earthy nose of truffle and underbrush, with a hint of iris and a whiff of leather. Reflecting the forward nature of the vintage, the palate is soft and warm, with sweet wild cherry, plum and round tannins. Drink soon."
Red Blend,"Shows plenty of palate weight, but very little tannin, combining cedar and vanilla from oak with slightly grapy, black cherry flavors. It's ready to drink now; don't count on aging it for very long."
Red Blend,"Fresh berry, mint, cola and herb aromas make for a classic Maipo bouquet. Feels fresh and good, with plying tannins and bright acidity. Tastes earthy, mossy and herbal, with ample berry fruit. Licorice and prune flavors carry the finish. Syrah with Cabernet, Carmenère and Petit Verdot."

The mouth is hefty and bold, with a mix of coffee and herbal flavors as well as cassis and blackberry. The finish is heavy and a bit raisiny, with depth and density. Drink now through 2015."
Red Blend,"A fine red wine, full-bodied, tannic and spicy, with juicy berry and tobacco flavors. The jug-shaped bottle is one of the cutest in California."
Red Blend,"This blend of 25% Sangiovese, 25% Petit Verdot, 25% Cabernet Franc and 25% Merlot shows the winery's characteristic tobacco spice in a subdued way, along with red and black cherry, hibiscus and red currant-filled chocolate truffle scents. The palate is leathery and full of dried cherry, nutmeg and vanilla flavors."
Red Blend,"Earthy, gamy aromas are intense and suggest meaty berry fruits and animal hide. In the mouth, this mystery red blend feels jammy but soft at its core. Baked black-fruit and chocolate flavors finish with a chewy texture and notes of fudge and cassis. For the price, this is a generous wine that overdelivers; drink through 2019."
Red Blend,"Enormously sweet and soft, with glycerine, brown sugar, black cherry, white chocolate, vanilla bean and white pepper flavors, this is one of the more eccentric, heady dessert wines out there. The alcohol is ridiculously high, yet the Madeira-like sweetness balances it."
Red Blend,"From Sardinia, this is a delightful rosé made with native grapes. It offers strawberry, crushed cherry and myrtle berry aromas that carry over to the palate along with a slightly sweet finish."
Red Blend,"This is a bold ripe wine that is dominated by firm while juicy Tannat. Named after the characteristic black berets worn by the menfolk of Gascony, the wine is powerful and dense with black fruits and balanced acidity. Drink this already enjoyable wine now, or better from 2018."
Red Blend,"Don't let the Red Wine label fool you. This is 92% Syrah with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon. It provides immediate appeal with its aromas of raspberry, plummy fruit, orange peel and chocolate. The palate has full-bodied, sumptuous flavors that linger. Drink now."
Red Blend,"Despite showing hickory and barbecued aromas of wood spice, smoked meat and stewed dark fruit, this Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend is firm and tight in the mouth, with smacking acidity. Herbal, lightly woody flavors of spice and earthy berry fruits finish bold, with olive and green tobacco notes. Drink through 2022."
Red Blend,"Dark violet-red in color, this is a blend of 40% Petite Sirah, 35% Petit Verdot and 25% Shiraz. A bouquet of cherry, violet and mesquite lay the groundwork for a winning mélange of savory fruit flavors—think cherry, strawberry, smoke, flint, jasmine and orange peel. Smooth tannins lead the way to an orange-rind finish, with a hint of smoke and a slight umami feeling on the palate."
Red Blend,"This red combines Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon to create black currant and Mediterranean herb aromas. The easygoing, approachable palate shows black cherry and dark spice flavors, framed by polished tannins. Enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"This is a luminous, mature red wine with thick concentration and huge—almost too much—emphasis on toasted oak. Aromas recall vanilla, spice and coffee, although you will find blueberry and cherry on the finish: It is a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot."
Red Blend,"A blend of Zweigelt, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, hints of white pepper and bay leaf frame the just-ripe, crunchy damson-plum aroma. Tight, finely-knit tight tannins make for a lasting structure that can mature, while the acidity keeps this classy and fresh. The dark, brooding plum flavor plays in the background and culminates in a spicy, peppery finish."
Red Blend,"Lightly roasted, leathery berry aromas are oaky but not overly woody or resiny. A dense, concentrated palate is creamy but appropriate in feel, while flavors of black cherry, cassis, baking spices, vanilla and caramel end in a lasting swirl of licorice, nutmeg and cocoa powder flavors."
Red Blend,"Aromas of leather, tilled soil, game and an earthy whiff of barnyard follow through to the evolved palate along with raisin, baked plum, anise and a touch of mint. A bitter almond note closes the finish."
Red Blend,"Bright, ripe, seemingly sweet fruit fills the aromas and flavors of this soft and generous wine blended from Pinot Noir, Pinotage and Pinot Meunier grapes. It floods the palate with rich raspberry and black cherry notes. And since the tannins are very light and the acidity low, it has a pillowy texture."
Red Blend,"This wine is dark-colored, full-flavored and firmly structured, and will pair nicely with a big protein like a grilled steak or osso buco. It does a great job of combining concntrated dark-fruit flavors with some dark chocolate, on a bracing texture of good acidity and fine-grained tannins."
Red Blend,"Fairly hot and heavy at first, as alcohol blows up your nostrils. But let it settle and you'll get dark, sultry aromas of leather and black plum in front of edgy, mildly citric cassis and red plum flavors. The blend is Carmenère, Petit Verdot and Shiraz, which is not something found on every shelf. Like its Cab Franc-Petit Verdot partner, Anke Blend-2 is good but not great."
Red Blend,"Aromas of black olive and black fruits show an almost grilled element. This wine offers energy and balance, with a touch of oak. Plum, berry and cherry flavors end powerfully on a tightly wound finish."
Red Blend,"This approachable, bright blend of Sangiovese and Montelpulciano, has forward sensations of black cherry and black berry, with a hint of white pepper. Supple, round tannins make this very drinkable now."
Red Blend,"Aromas of smoke, grilled herb, scorched earth and eucalyptus lead the nose. While it shows the heat of the vintage, it also has elegance, offering dried black cherry, fig licorice and clove. A hint of almond wraps up the finish while velvety tannins provide supple support. Drink soon to capture fruit and freshness."
Red Blend,"A multigrape blend that seems to be lacking focus, this tastes strongly of vanilla and butter cookies, the fruit extremely light."
Red Blend,"This six-grape blend is led by Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of toasty, rooty berry fruits come with an essence of cola. The palate is layered and mellow, offering mild tannins. An oaky flavor profile includes coconut and vanilla, while the finish is spicy, mildly herbal and a touch chocolaty."
Red Blend,"This is a good, sound, somewhat rustic wine that's fine for drinking now with, yes, spaghetti, with meatballs and a rich marinara sauce. The wine is dry and fruity, with sturdy tannins. Cabernet, Merlot, Zinfandel."
Red Blend,"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and a drop of Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of red currant, cedar, toasted notes and a whiff of exotic spice. Black pepper, espresso and grilled herb accent the core of fleshy black cherry and cassis. Tightly wound tannins provide the framework and leave an astringent finish, while an anise note marks the close."
Red Blend,"Comprised of Sangiovese and 5% Merlot, this offers aromas of plum, blackberry, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of toasted oak. The palate offers dried black cherry, prune, licorice and espresso alongside tightly knit tannins. Drink 2016–2020."
Red Blend,"Made with organically farmed grapes, this blend of 60% Sangiovese, 30% Barbera and 10% Sagrantino opens with aromas of tilled earth, blue flower, ripe berry and spice. The dense palate doles out fleshy black cherry, crushed plum, black pepper and tobacco alongside firm but velvety tannins. It finishes on a succulent note."
Red Blend,"Pure and soaring elderberry fruit with overtones of Morello cherry puts this in the darker fruit spectrum. Nonetheless, it has all the freshness and verve of red-fruited styles. This balanced and immensely enjoyable wine only reveals its seriousness slowly. Velvety texture and definite but gentle structure spell that this will also age well."
Red Blend,"Aromas of ground black pepper, blackberry, cured meats and plum lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The extracted palate delivers toasted notes, roasted coffee bean, espresso, blackberry extract, chocolate and vanilla alongside teeth-coating tannins. Drink 2016–2020."
Red Blend,"This blend of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot opens with leafy, almost weedy aromas that burn off to reveal black fruit and green pepper. On the palate, a core of black cherry mingles with espresso and coffee notes. Round with velvety tannins, this is already accessible so enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"This is a pristine and elegant Bolgheri Superiore with a particularly focused aromatic profile. The blend is 60-20-20 Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot. A green, herbal note comes through. You'll also recognize elements of caper, green olive, mineral, tobacco and exotic fruit. It shows thick fruit and dense concentration as well."
Red Blend,"This concentrated blend of Nero d'Avola and other grapes opens with aromas of earth, game, underbrush and mature black fruit. The dense palate offers velvety tannins and doles out juicy black cherry flavor layered with fig, chocolate, white pepper, carob and mint."
Red Blend,"A good if somewhat generic red wine, blended from Dornfelder, Cabernet Sauvignon and Dunkelfelder. It delivers black cherry fruit, medium body and soft tannins."
Red Blend,"Aromas of culinary spice, prune and a whiff of woodland berry take center stage on this smooth red. The ripe palate shows dried red cherry, fig, clove and a hint of bitter almond alongside polished tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the fruit and freshness."

Red Blend,"Sunbaked soil, new leather, forest floor and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this. The smooth elegantly structured palate delivers morello cherry, black raspberry, dried herb, licorice and tobacco while fine-grained tannins provide polished support."
Red Blend,"This bold, dry, firmly tannic wine will taste good now with rich foods, but could easily improve with aging through 2017. It is deeply colored, full bodied and a bit sandy in texture, yet that grip seems O.K. in this wine, balanced by the ripe fruit flavors."
Red Blend,"This wine offers a lot of fruit, with subtle background notes of leather, wet earth and prune. It's a fresh, easydrinking selection."
Red Blend,"Cabernet Sauvignon (73%) makes up the majority of this blend, with the balance Syrah (15%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of barrel spice, baking spice, dark fruit and herb are followed by luxurious black-fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It shows a bit of heat but otherwise delivers."
Red Blend,"Smoky and earthy in aroma, tart and tannic in the mouth, this is an assertive, mouth-puckering wine."
Red Blend,"Aromas of spiced blueberry, grilled herbs, cooking spice and a whiff of leather lead the nose of this blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The savory palate offers ripe plum, crushed black cherry, black pepper and mint alongside polished tannins. A licorice note marks the close."
Red Blend,"This new cuvée is 60% Malbec, 35% Syrah and the rest Merlot. It seems to have been given extra barrel time, and the overpowering and heavy toast scents and flavors dominate. The raspberry fruit flavors are somewhat buried as a result, and the wine seems over-matched. But more bottle age may help to open it up."
Red Blend,"This ripe, rich, almost decadently thick wine is about as close as a Washington vintner can come to the decadently ripe style of the cultish Bordeaux blends of California. Along with the unctuous New World fruit, sap and flesh, there are thick, ripe tannins and a vivid acid underpinning. It drinks well right out of the bottle, the flavors beautifully wrapped together, mixing black fruits, black olives, herb and earth, smoke and coffee and toast."
Red Blend,"Just mature, this smooth, velvet-textured wine has juicy black fruits with a smoky character that adds interest to the structure and acidity that give the wine shape. Rich while fresh at the end, it is ready to drink."
Red Blend,Heavily toasted charred oak aromas meet maple syrup flavors in this sweet and full-bodied wine. It is heavy on the oaky elements and light on natural-tasting fruit flavors.
Red Blend,"A juicy blend of Nero d'Avola and Nerello Mascalese, this wine offers blackberry and black cherry flavors in a friendly, easy-drinking style. It's perfect for everyday dinners and informal occasions."
Red Blend,"Soft and watery, with just traces of cherries and watermelons."
Red Blend,"Aromas of raspberry, black licorice, woodspice, toast and cherry are followed by abundant red- and black-fruit flavors. There's plenty of richness and a finish that won't quit."
Red Blend,"Aromas of plum, tilled soil, truffle, dark baking spice and a whiff of violet lead the nose. The medium-bodied, easygoing palate offers juicy black cherry, white pepper and clove framed in lithe tannins and lively acidity. Enjoy through 2018."
Red Blend,"This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot is powerful, with a blueberry flavor, a mild green note, a balsamic hint and a molasses tinge. It's saturated and clampy in feel, with aggressive flavors of lemony oak, balsamic fruit and baked berry. Warm, oaky and full of licorice flavor on the finish. Drink 2014–2019."
Red Blend,"This is a richly textured, balanced wine that's medium bodied and fruity in style. It's crisp and silky with cherry, licorice, cola and oak flavors."
Red Blend,"A nontraditional blend of 35% Zinfandel, 31% Merlot, 17% Grenache and 17% Petite Sirah, this offers cooked strawberry, sea-salt caramel candy, plum pudding and sweet violets on the nose. The palate shows more dry restraint, with black currant fruit and herbs of dill, oregano and marjoram."
Red Blend,"Greenwood's Merlot-Zinfandel blend is a nod to vintner-in-chief Allan Green's Dragons baseball team and would be so fun to recommend to baseball lovers the world over if only it tasted better. There's some nice cherry notes buried in there somewhere, but otherwise the wine is overly tannic and its aromatics seemingly benched."
Red Blend,"Fragrant blue flower, black plum, eucalyptus and a whiff of exotic spice lead the nose. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, pomegranate, vanilla and mocha alongside austere, fine-grained tannins that give the finish grip."
Red Blend,"Very deep black plum, smashed red berries, concentrated cola and coffee liqueur aromas entice the nose on this blend of 40% Cabernet Franc, 40% Zinfandel and 20% Grenache. It's very spicy and lively on the palate with an almost biting, explosive acidity. Flavors of espresso and deep red fruits are noticeable."
Red Blend,"Aromas of berry, cherry and earthy schist are what the Priorat is known for. This wine feels tight and pure, with firm tannins and a gritty personality. Toasty flavors of mocha, black cherry, raspberry and cassis are generous, while the finish is fresh, tight, balanced and indicates that midterm aging will only help; drink 2017–2022."
Red Blend,"Made from all six Bordeaux varieties, this estate grown blend only hits a few notes but hits them persistently and deliciously with milk chocolate, dried cherry, and herbs. It's soft and silky and lingers on the finish."
Red Blend,"Intriguing aromas of boysenberry and blueberry come with smoky notes of hickory and aged cheese. This is showing a firm grip on the palate along with ripe, intense flavors of black fruits and prune. On the finish, it's tannic and loaded with licorice and toasty accents. Drink through 2019."

Red Blend,"This wine is a unique blend of 50% Petit Verdot, 25% Syrah and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon aged in a mixture of 59% new French and American oak. Unusual aromas of lemon twist, vanilla, white pepper, herb and green wood lead to high-acid elegant fruit flavors backed by coarse gritty-feeling tannins. It doesn't stand up by itself but has a place at the dinner table."
Red Blend,"Dark in color and slightly bashful at first, this blend of Syrah, Sangiovese and Merlot shows strength in its solid structure, with bright aromas of red cherry, blackberry, leather and cured meat. It would pair perfectly with stewed game meat, like wild boar."
Red Blend,"From one of Sicily's most powerful wine co-ops, this blend of Syrah and Nero d'Avola offers pretty fruit intensity, with layers of red cherry and blackberry. Subtle tones of spice, leather and bitter almond fill in the back."
Red Blend,"This single-pago wine is earthy, rooty, herbal and almost grassy smelling. The mouthfeel is clampy, with dried berry, herbal shadings and a chunky, earthy finish. As a whole there's a malty character to this wine, but it has elements of quality and character."
Red Blend,"This is a light, fresh wine that shows attractive acidity while also offering some firm tannins. It has a crisp edge, but not a great amount of depth, and will probably be ready to drink soon."
Red Blend,"Aromas of worn saddle leather and stewed blackberries and raspberries come with some volatility. Overall, the palate feels taut and tense. Tart acids cut the finish short and kick the salivary glands into overdrive."
Red Blend,"Big, hearty fruit flavors and full body without a lot of tannin make this wine appealing and a good match for meaty dishes from carne asada burritos to pot roast. It's probably no coincidence considering the brand name that it has lots of oak flavor, adding vanilla and other spices."
Red Blend,"A Bordeaux-style blend with Cabernet Sauvignon (49%) taking the lead, this wine opens with aromas of sugared plum, mesquite and herbs. It's soft in feel with a smoky finish."
Red Blend,"This is a spicy and fragrant red wine, the 63% Grenache dominating the fruit, and the 37% Syrah filling in the back with peppery tannins.

Red Blend,"This Bordeaux-style blend is colored like inky violet and has matching aromas of black plums, cassis and violet. It offers a nice interplay of firm tannins and zesty acidity among flavors of blackberry, black cherry, violet, anise and toffee. The finish is characterized by an impressive burst of brightness and a lingering caramel note."

Red Blend,"This is very well made, smooth and supple. The round, approachable fruit tastes of red currant, red berry, and black olive. There is a flash of heat in the back of the throat, but it offer excellent value. Unfortunately it's very limited—just 99 cases."
Red Blend,"The bottle that changed Italian wine forever, Tignanello is as modern and innovative as its first vintage many decades ago. Soft blackberry and cherry is backed by balanced spice, leather and toasted espresso. Those rich oak tones do a wonderful job of holding up the wine's natural richness and velvety smoothness. Hold 10 years or more."
Red Blend,"This wine is an unusual blend of Barbera (40%), Malbec (25%), Sangiovese (21%) and Cabernet Franc. It works, with aromas of sweet baking spices, vanilla, cherry and herb that are followed by generous, velvety cherry flavors. The oak is very primary but it still brings appeal."
Red Blend,"They grow powerful grapes in parts of Amador County and this one stands out for its elevated alcohol. The mix of 70% Zinfandel and smaller helpings of Mourvèdre, Barbera, Syrah and Touriga combine for a spicy cola taste. Leathery notes and big tannins linger long on the finish."

Red Blend,"Initially this smells green and candied, with overripe and underripe aromas. The palate is chunky and bulky, while flavors of black fruits and green herbs finish grassy, with notes of oregano and tarragon. Overall this is heavy, extracted, sweet and sticky."

Red Blend,"Picture grandma standing over a pot of stewed prunes, which fill the dusty old house with their sickly aromas. Cooked, earthy and rustic, this wine has little going for it. Just barely acceptable."
Red Blend,"Jumpy cherry and berry aromas are basic. A fruity, fresh palate delivers straightforward berry flavors prior to a quick finish."
Red Blend,"This brawny wine opens with aromas that recall resin, nail polish remover, prune and nutmeg. The warm, monolithic palate offers dried black fruit steeped in spirits, raisin and licorice alongside assertive tannins. The burn of evident alcohol and lack of fruit richness throws it off balance."
Red Blend,"From Rhône-possessed Paso Robles, an adventurous blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Zinfandel. The aroma is subdued now, closed and brooding.

Red Blend,"This Petite Sirah-led blend, which also features 24% Syrah, 9% Grenache and 1% Viognier, offers deep violet aromas alongside pine, tarragon and sea salt caramel. There's a strong molasses and pancakes-with-fruity-syrup character on the palate and very soft mouthfeel. Definitely a dessert sipper."
Red Blend,"A blend of Sangiovese topped up with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of ripe plum, baked earth, pressed blue flower and brown spice. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, mocha, anise and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins."
Red Blend,"Captures the essence of a Paso Robles red wine. It's softly complex, smooth and deliciously dry, with blackberry, chocolate and oak flavors. The blend is Touriga Nacional, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot."
Red Blend,"Baked and heavy, this has prune, raisin and jammy berry aromas. The weightiness carries onto the palate, which is chewy and smooth. Flavors of blackberry, spice and jammy syrup lead to a finish with a chocolaty tone. Tasted twice, with consistent results."
Red Blend,"Here's a savory Chianti showing violet and plum aromas with hints of leather. The palate offers black cherry, prune and white pepper flavors, all nicely balanced with edgy but refined tannins and fresh acidity. It will pair beautifully with pastas and bean soups."
Red Blend,"Made with Nebbiolo and Pinot Nero, this delivers freshness and structure. Intriguing aromas suggest rose, tilled earth, red apple, berries and a whiff of cake spices. The palate offers wild cherry and cinnamon alongside an elegant, persistent mousse and crisp acidity. Enjoy through 2018."
Red Blend,"Spice, berry, earth, leather, tobacco and blue flower aromas lead the nose of this elegant wine. The ripe, round palate delivers fleshy black cherry and raspberry, accented by white pepper and cinnamon and framed by polished tannins. Drink 2015–2019."
Red Blend,"This big-bottled, wax-topped wine blends half Merlot with a quarter each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Thick and concentrated in red fruit, it holds back on body somewhat, making way for a soft, likable character with a touch of grit among the definitive red cherry."
Red Blend,"Quite light, suggesting fruit that was picked at less than optimal ripeness. This thin wine has tart red fruit, a streak of caraway seed and a finish with sweet cracker highlights."
Red Blend,"Oaky and a little spotty, with aromas of cheese, cinnamon and wood resin sitting heavily on herbal, traditional fruit. The acidity is bracing, so there's a lemony bite to the palate along with flavors of raisin, raspberry and cherry. A fairly good blend of Merlot, Carmenère and Cabernet, but one that's missing a few parts."
Red Blend,"Made with the traditional governo method of refermenting the wine with partially dried grapes, this exceptionally smooth offering opens with aromas of prune, plum cake, raisin, spice and graphite. The palate delivers ripe black cherry, plum, cinnamon-spice and a balsamic note alongside velvety tannins. It's structured, soft and already accessible, so enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"This young fresh red has aromas of dark berry and a whiff of blue flower while the easy-drinking palate offers wild cherry and a hint of spice. It's extremely simple, so drink soon."
Red Blend,"Aromas of bramble fruits and strawberry are followed by red and black fruit and spice in this easygoing red. Bursts of strawberry and red fruit mingle with rich spice and a dry finish. Pair with game, pasta dishes."
Red Blend,"This Syrah-dominant blend with 12% Grenache, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cinsault and 2% Viognier offers a delicious, fruit-driven core matched with complex spice notes of sweet smoke, cured meat and fresh tobacco leaf. The mouth is silky and smooth with fine-grain tannins and a white pepper-flecked finish. Drink now–2012."
Red Blend,"This blend of Sangiovese, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and other varieties plays well to type. It shows a wealth of ripe, dusty black fruit that's richly round and soft on the palate, approachable and lightly oaked."
Red Blend,"Made with 85% Sangiovese, 10% Alicante Bouschet and 5% Merlot, this savory red delivers aromas and flavors of underbrush, black cherry, licorice and a hint of Mediterranean herb. It's easy drinking and balanced with lithe tannins."
Red Blend,"Recently implemented winemaker and cellar changes make this one of the best Sassicaias ever. This Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend delivers thick concentration and sun-kissed aromas of black fruit, prune, dried bay leaf, black olive and tobacco. The thick, fertile soils that characterize the magical strip of coastal Tuscany at Bol-gheri help shape amazing richness and intensity."
Red Blend,"A blend of Syrah (59%) and Cabernet Sauvignon from mostly Upchurch and Ciel du Cheval vineyards, this wine offers reticent aromas of herbs, woodspice, mineral and dark fruit. The blackberry and black cherry flavors are plump and show a sense of balance, with slightly dry tannins providing some heft."
Red Blend,"There are lots of delicious flavors in this smooth blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. It impresses for its voluptuous flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and sweet oak. It could be a little firmer in structure; it's soft and melted, like pastry filling."
Red Blend,"This inky blend of Pallagrello Nero and Casavecchia (two of Italy's oldest grape varieties) opens with opulent aromas of chocolate, exotic spice, dark fruit, cola and cinnamon. It is smooth and rich on the palate but the wine also imparts a high dose of sweetness and succulence that would work well next to rare beef."
Red Blend,"This is an easy wine to drink with a soft, generous personality and interesting aromas of red berry fruit backed by dusty minerals and spice. It would pair well with pasta, pork and veal thanks to its no-fuss approach and natural succulence."
Red Blend,"An obscure Catalonian wine made from indigenous grapes, this pricey oddball starts with bubblegum and candy aromas mixed with smoke and meat. The color is dark and the wine is a bit rough. But in a country, unusual way it redeems itself with zippy cherry flavors and a fresh, tight mouthfeel. Best with food."
Red Blend,"This opens with savory, slightly beefy aromas of bresaola and ripe blackberry. There seems to be a touch of sweetness on the palate, followed by a thickly textured finish."
Red Blend,"Dry and acidic, this light-bodied wine has tart flavors of mashed cherries, cherryskins, orange zest and citrus fruits. It's a Bordeaux blend with Zinfandel and Sangiovese. Nice with pizza with prosciutto and olives."
Red Blend,"A blend of mainly Zinfandel with Petite Sirah, this red shows softly ripe, warm climate flavors of sweet, sugary raspberries, cherries, red currants and chocolate."
Red Blend,"Blackberry, clove paste, wet clay and a peppery spice greet the nose in this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Primitivo and 17% Merlot. The palate offers dense elderberries and black currants, but is characterized by a strong earthiness, bolstered by interesting herbal tinges of tomato leaf and dill."
Red Blend,"Spiced plum and oak aromas lead the nose of this firm red. The palate is lean, offering sour cherry, vanilla, sage and coconut notes over a frame of astringent tannins."
Red Blend,"Here's a delicious Amarone, with aromas of spirit-soaked black cherry and spice. The palate is rich but refined, with succulent black cherry, raspberry and plum flavors all layered with nutmeg and white pepper accents."
Red Blend,"A blend of local grapes with Syrah, this fruity wine enfolds a core of tannins. Stalky, smoky flavors balance with a red plum-skin texture and crisp acidity. It is young, the fruit still developing, so drink from 2017."
Red Blend,"A ripe, rich and deliciously spicy wine, it has a light touch of white pepper, red berry fruits and a broad brush of acidity. It's rounded, although with some tannic structure, and can certainly be drunk now."
Red Blend,"Made of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Canaiolo, this opens with violet and leather aromas. The savory, straightforward palate offers mature black cherry, sage and anise flavors, supported by lithe tannins. Enjoy through 2020."
Red Blend,"This holds 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 39% Zinfandel and 1% Petit Verdot. It satisfies in dusty dried cranberry and chocolate components, offering all-around balance with a shot of brawn, the latter most likely from the Cab's birthplace on Howell Mountain."
Red Blend,"A wine that makes you take notice. The bouquet is intense, with minerality, char, huge black-fruit aromas and handsome shadings of chocolate and coffee. Power and purity come on like gangbusters, and the flavors are a classic mix of blackberry, cassis and fine Swiss chocolate. Heady, smooth and impressive. My highest rated wine yet from Carlos Pulenta's Vistalba label. Drink now through 2014. Composed of 87% Malbec with Bonarda and Cabernet Sauvignon."
Red Blend,"Made with Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with aromas of blackberry jam, iris and a whiff of new leather. The zesty palate shows black cherry and a hint of clove alongside brisk acidity and drying tannins that leave a sharp finish."
Red Blend,"The 2006 Boundary is a full-bodied, concentrated Bordeaux-style blend, with plenty of cassis and vanilla apparent on the nose. There's a slight baked fruit component to the wine, and supple, slightly dusty-textured tannins on the finish. Drink it over the next 5–6 years."
Red Blend,"Ripe plum, blue flower and an earthy whiff of truffle lead the nose, while the juicy palate offers black cherry and clove flavors with a hint of game. Chewy tannins provide the framework."
Red Blend,"Though the nose is a bit muted, assertive juicy black plum and muddled mulberry unfold in the round mouth. Firm tannins follow through to the dry, waxy finish. Try in another year or two, or give it a good long decant before drinking now."
Red Blend,"Aromas of wet clay, spice and soft black fruits carry the bouquet, while the palate is plump and easygoing, with mildly herbal cassis and black-fruit flavors. If you don't mind a little overt, heavy oak then this four-grape blend headed by Cabernet will do the trick."
Red Blend,"This straightforward Sangiovese-based wine conveys subdued aromas of blackberry, espresso and toasted notes. The palate is somewhat dilute but offers restrained red cherry and hints of white pepper alongside firm but fleeting tannins."
Red Blend,"Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah come together to offer scents of red currant, toast, cedar and spice. It's firm and savory, with notes of white pepper, aniseed and dried aromatic herbs alongside assertive tannins. Drink 2016–2020."
Red Blend,"Fragrant blue flower, plum, cake spice and a whiff of leather are some of the aromas you'll find on this stunning wine. Made with organically farmed Sangiovese, the juicy, delicious palate doles out ripe black cherry, fleshy blackberry, white pepper, licorice and grilled herb. It's open and well balanced, with firm, polished tannins. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,"Made from Spanish varieties, this dessert wine is very sweet in residual sugar, but it lacks richness. Shows modest flavors of blackberries and chocolate."
Red Blend,"Very big, modern, sweet and oaky. And that doesn't mean it's bad, because the richness, high alcohol (15%), buttery barrel notes and candy-like qualities are all rendered well. Still, be on the watch for creamy oak, cinnamon, café mocha and butter more than precise, angular fruit character. Should get more integrated with another year of bottle age. The boisterous blend is Garnacha, Syrah and Mazuelo."
Red Blend,"Aromas that recall underbrush, toast, oak and ripe black-skinned berry come together on this. The tightly wound palate offers dried red currant, raw cherry, roasted coffee bean and a note of sage while dusty, almost grainy tannins clench the finish."
Red Blend,"Aromas of cedar, plum, toast, espresso and a whiff of blue flowers lead the nose of this Sangiovese blended with 15% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The ripe, straightforward palate offers ripe cassis, coconut, mocha and a hint of anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins."
Red Blend,"Rich and soft, this is a fine blended wine that shows layers of wood, ripe tannins, flavors of blackberry fruits and good balancing acidity. There is a delicious juiciness from the St Laurent, which is tightened by the other grapes in the blend."
Red Blend,"Clos de los Siete is a perennial leader among under-$20 wines from Argentina. Blueberry and graham cracker aromas are ripe and a touch reduced. The palate is saturated yet juicy, while blackberry, boysenberry, cardamom and nutmeg flavors feed into a dark tasting, compact finish. For a 50,000-case wine, this is a prize to behold."
Red Blend,"This blend exhibits thick density and concentration and direct aromas of blackberry, black ink, cola and roasted chestnuts. The wood is well-integrated, and the wine is juicy and firm on the palate. Drink after 2010."
Red Blend,"This wine is reduced and somewhat flat in tone, with simple, light-bodied ripeness and plum and raspberry flavors."
Red Blend,"This blend of 87% Syrah and 13% Merlot mixes plummy blackberry, blueberry and leather flavors. An earthiness marked by roses permeates the nose and palate, buoyed by bright acidity and a tangy lift of cranberry and white pepper."
Red Blend,"Here's a satiny, approachable red blend with notes of black currant, brandy-soaked cherry and a touch of vanilla bean on the nose and mouth. A savory peppery spice reveals itself on the end, with moderate tannins lingering through the close."
Red Blend,"Exotic spice, red fruit, herbal notes and cherry cola characterize this 50-50 blend of Alicante and Syrah. The wine delivers measured intensity but does boast deep freshness thanks to its acidity and menthol finish."
Red Blend,"One look, one whiff, one taste and you're swooning. This mature, tawny, ready-to-drink gran reserva with aromas of lemon peel, cedar and dried cherry is the epitome of elegance. A juicy, supple palate is highly approachable, while flavors of vanilla, orange peel, saffron and dried plum don't waver on the finish. Drink through 2027."
Red Blend,"This well-made red blend has no shortage of ripe black-fruit flavors or gripping texture. It's full bodied, very dark in color, smells like cinnamon, clove and cherries, and tastes very ripe and concentrated: like chocolate covered cherries without the sweetness."
Red Blend,"A robust blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers aromas of baked plum, mocha, menthol and oak-driven spice. The hearty palate initially opens with black fruit, chocolate, licorice and dried herb flavors but the heat of evident alcohol dominates the finish and the close."
Red Blend,"This vibrant Rosso weaves together ripe plum, violet, crushed black cherry, sweet cake spices, menthol and Mediterranean herbs. The juicy palate is balanced by supple tannins and fresh acidity. It's already accessible but will offer easy-drinking enjoyment through at least 2016."
Red Blend,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Syrah has aromas of cocoa, baking spice, green wood, plum and black cherry. It's concentrated and richly flavored, with layers of dark fruit, coffee and mesquite. Firm tannins lead to a warm finish."
Red Blend,"Sourced from the estate's Paderewski and Catapult vineyards, this blend of 32% Syrah, 25% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre, 10% Tempranillo and 8% Zinfandel bursts with blackberry, baking spice, violet and Concord grape aromas. Framed by firm but ready tannins, the palate shows blackberry, cola, white pepper and dried lavender flavors."
Red Blend,"Made by Angelo Gaja at his estate in coastal Tuscany, this blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc leads with aromas of plum, spice and warm toasted notes. The structured, elegant palate delivers restrained black currant and black cherry accented with notes of black pepper and coffee alongside polished tannins. It's still young and a bit nervous, so give it time to develop its potential. Drink 2015–2030."
Red Blend,"Soft, bitter and overripe, with raisin, mocha and Port flavors. It's a Rhône-style blend."
Red Blend,"Roasted, rubbery aromas come with an herbal offset and mild stalky notes. This is full and rubbery feeling, with baked berry, herb and peppery flavors residing before a dry, tannic, stocky finish that's a fair conclusion to this blend of Garnacha, Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon."
Red Blend,"Aromas of violet, iris, ripe black-skinned fruit, dried grape and a whiff of tobacco lead the way on this full-bodied charmer. The smooth, structured palate delivers dried cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and cake spice while velvety tannins provide support."
Red Blend,"This round and easy-drinking wine, 95% Aglianico and 5% Sangiovese, is loaded with a juicy black-cherry flavor that's accented by hints of black pepper and mineral. It's soft, fresh and incredibly food friendly. Pair it with everything from hearty pasta dishes to barbecue."
Red Blend,"Merlot comprises 53% of the blend, Cabernet Sauvignon 40%, and Cab Franc fills in the final 7%. Well built and satisfyingly complete, this tribute to grower Dick Boushey uses fruit from his oldest (25-year) vines. Scents of toast, mint and moist earth introduce varied fruit flavors of boysenberry, purple grape, cherry and plum. It's a big, bold wine that segues neatly into a finish of chocolate and butterscotch."
Red Blend,"“Open, pour, drink” is the message behind Trie, also a blend of 3 grapes. It's lively, fresh, almost Beaujolais-like in its juicy, fruity, red berry character. Ripe, soft, just a hint of spice."
Red Blend,"Rustic and a little sweet tasting, this has flavors of cherry pie, red currant and toast. Drink it with cheeseburgers."
Red Blend,"This Rosso di Montepulciano offers pretty floral fragrances of violet and rose typical of Sangiovese and Mammolo grapes. The palate boasts wild cherry and white pepper flavors, with a hint of cinnamon. This is silky smooth and easy to drink; it's ready now, so enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"Round, big and medicinal, with clumsy, roasted berry fruit aromas. The palate isn't overly charming, and the flavors of tomato paste, cranberry and herbal red fruit are curious. Finishes cleansing and zesty, but with another wave of tomato-based flavors. Shows a lot of cool-climate, mountain influence."
Red Blend,"This blend of 75% Garnacha, 20% Tempranillo and 5% Viura opens with oaky aromas of cigar box, floral notes and raisin. A snappy, fresh palate reflects high elevation and a north-facing vineyard exposure, while this tastes oaky and of herbal currant and raspberry. A spicy finish of dried red-fruit notes and a saucy snap fits into the traditional mode for Rioja. Drink through 2021."
Red Blend,"Raisiny and sweeet smelling, with baked qualities but also a bitter bite of horseradish. The palate is deep and hard, with burnt notes, tough tannins and berry flavors softened by buttery oak. Beefy and rubbery, but with enough ripeness to be worth a look."
Red Blend,"The tannins give this wine a lockdown feeling, making it hard and astringent. But the fruit is strong and jammy, suggesting raspberries, cherries and blackberries. Made from Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, it's forward and one-dimensional now, but delicious, and unlikely to improve with age."
Red Blend,"A blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Ciliegiolo, Canaiolo and Colorino, this has aromas of black plum and baking spice. On the brisk palate, racy acidity and rounded tannins support sour cherry, clove and herb. Enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"This blends 51% Merlot with 29% Zinfandel, 15% Petit Verdot and 5% Petite Sirah, combining nicely for a full-bodied expression of chocolate and dried dark cherry. On the palate, it becomes dusty and somewhat rustic, with an intensely juicy finish."
Red Blend,"A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Syrah and other grapes, this features aromas of bright berry, spice and violet. The vibrant, easy-drinking palate offers black cherry, red currant and black pepper alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity."
Red Blend,"Surprisingly bright for the vintage and displaying Gaja's trademark elegance, this offers aromas of blue flower, perfumed berry, cake spices and a whiff of leather. The ripe palate delivers mature black cherry layered with white pepper and cinnamon alongside supple tannins. Drink 2016–2026."
Red Blend,"A blend of four traditional Portuguese grape varietals, this unusual offering begins with a distinctly pruney nose, and seems soft and slightly oxidized. But as it breathes it adds interesting flavors of dried herbs and forest floor, rustic and complex."
Red Blend,"Here's a surprise from Mt. Etna that blew us away. Made by Pietro Caciorgna, this is a delicate and linear wine with pristine aromas of blue flower, delicate forest fruit and black stone. It represents the best of elegant winemaking with that unmistakable blast of volcanic power at the rear."
Red Blend,"Red plum, tomato and brambly herbal aromas set up a snappy, astringent palate with strained raspberry, spice and herbal flavors. Very dry and acidic as it transitions to the finish. An herbal, sharp-edged red."
Red Blend,"Bold black-fruit aromas are pure and inviting. ?Overall, this blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is flush in feel, balanced and full of wild berry ?and plum flavors. On the finish, fully present acidity ?supports oak and chocolaty notes. This an exemplary ?large-production Spanish red."
Red Blend,"A 70-30 blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah, this has a dark garnet color, with ripe aromas of blackberry and sour cherry. The wine's acidity gives the palate a lively pop."
Red Blend,"This blend of Bordeaux grapes with Syrah is rich and spicy. It is made to be drunk young, with touches of toast and a dense texture that brings out the perfumed character of Syrah balanced with Bordeaux structure. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from late 2016."
Red Blend,"A big, burly proprietary red blend, Voluptous combines Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percentages of Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Zinfandel , creating a rich, darkly fruited wine with dusty tannins. Well-structured despite its girth, it delivers layers of licorice and leather on the finish. Drink now."
Red Blend,"This opens with earthy aromas of game, underbrush and leather. The ripe palate offers dried cherry, fleshy raspberry, grilled sage, licorice and baking spice alongside bracing tannins."
Red Blend,"This has a fragrance of oak and bell pepper, with a whiff of spice. The palate shows black currant, prune and oak, but above all, very evident alcohol."
Red Blend,"Aromas of French oak, mature black-skinned fruit, espresso and a hint of blue flower lead the nose on this structured red. The generous palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, ground pepper and licorice while velvety tannins provide smooth, seamless support. Drink through 2021."
Red Blend,"The blend of this wine has changed significantly in 2010, now an equal mix of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with 9% Syrah. As with other J. Bookwalter reds, it is loaded with appealing barrel toast, in both aroma and flavor. The Syrah shines through, adding spice and ripe berry flavors."
Red Blend,"Starts out rustic and leathery, with hints of smoke, leafiness and earth along with baked berry and spice. This four-grape wine has good density and mouthfeel that frames leather, earth and slightly baked berry fruit flavors. Finishes chocolaty and sweet, with just enough acidity to maintain balance."
Red Blend,"Round, soft and approachable now in the California style, with ripe cherry, licorice, mocha and brown sugar flavors that last long, with a spicy finish. Defines the delicious, drink-me-now style of a young red wine."
Red Blend,"Chopped herb, underbrush, truffle and balsamic notes lead the nose. The palate is fresh, vibrant and polished, offering sour cherry fruit with a hint of licorice. A sage note closes the finish."
Red Blend,"Aromas of dried fruit and barrel spice lead to tart, slightly dilute seeming fruit flavors backed by lightly gritty tannins. It seems a bit evolved for its age."
Red Blend,"Dominated by Fronton's own native Négrette grape, this is a spicy, earthy wine. A green bell pepper undertow gives freshness while also an unripe character. The wine should be drunk now."
Red Blend,"A blend of Sangiovese, Colorino and Mammolo, this straightforward wine opens with aromas that recall plum cake, ripe black fruit and a hint of balsam. The juicy palate offers crushed black cherry accented with cinnamon. Drink now to capture the succulent fruit and freshness."
Red Blend,"This wine is in the “velvet” school of red blends, showing a very supple, rich texture and a definite level of sweetness to soften the overall impact. It has sweet-seeming aromas like maple syrup and blackberry jam, and ripe fruits on the palate too."
Red Blend,"This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry. With a mouthfeel like crushed velvet, a black pepper finish and an attractive price tag, it's a shame only 100 cases were produced."
Red Blend,"John and Helen Falcone blend multiple vintages and grapes into this annual experiment, and this is one of the best ones yet. Brown sugar, maple, blueberry pie, vanilla, gingerbread and caramel-laced coffee aromas show on the nose. There's a silky mouthfeel once sipped, with oaky flavors of chocolate, coffee, dried pepper, bay leaf and vanilla into the finish."
Red Blend,"It smells and tastes like freshly crushed strawberries and raspberries, but sweeter, with a mild texture, medium body, soft tannins and a lingering finish. Nicely done and elegant, it blends Zinfandel, Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Merlot."
Red Blend,"Rich flavors and a juicy texture make this dark-colored but medium-bodied wine fun to drink. It smells like ripe boysenberries, tastes almost jammy, and has a nice grip on the palate. It comes with a very reasonable price tag for the quality."
Red Blend,"A highly unusual blend of Burdin, a rare French hybrid, and Chambourcin grapes, this red wine offers delicate maraschino-cherry and berry flavors. It's a slightly fragile wine but whiffs of tobacco and garden soil lend complexity. The finish lingers on tart red fruit flavors and a hint of tannin."
Red Blend,"Black in color and overtly charred, toasted and blackened on the nose, this modern-styled Montsant blend is loaded with black fruits, licorice and hickory aromas. In the mouth, this is lush, ripe and strong as an ox. Oaky flavors of vanilla and coconut settle on chocolate and blackberry, while the finish echoes with licorice and vanilla flavors and thick, chewy tannins. Drink through 2021."
Red Blend,"A ripe, smooth wine, dominated by vanilla from wood and by red berry fruits. The tannic structure is subservient to the rich layers of mint and herbal flavors, while the fruit dominates. Finishes with chocolate and firm tannins."
Red Blend,"Opens with a light, herbal bouquet that features spice and elegant red fruit aromas. The palate keeps the mode going; it's crisp and fresh, with cherry, raspberry and spice flavors. Finishes firm and dry, with tobacco. A nice blend of Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc."
Red Blend,"A Sangiovese-based blend named for the expression “Call me Crazy,” this wine also contains small amounts of Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. Crazy or not, it works, providing a thicket of black and blue berry, smoky cinnamon and a juicy, medium build, meant to please, not to over-ponder."
Red Blend,"Yet another extreme barrel-aged wine from Core Wine Co. Cherry syrup and heavy wood presence on the nose is followed by dark chocolate, cooked vanilla and other flavors dominated by wood and age."
Red Blend,"This top-notch blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc from Mazzei's beautiful Maremma property boasts thick, modern concentration and pretty renderings of red fruit, vanilla and exotic spice. It has excellent texture in the mouth and is velvety and lively at the same time."
Red Blend,"Blackberry, plum, chocolate and tobacco aromas lead the nose on this structured wine. The palate offers roasted coffee bean, licorice, raisin and black pepper alongside tightly packed tannins that need time to unwind but for now leave an astringent, drying finish. You'll also detect the heat of alcohol on the finish."
Red Blend,"Gets rolling with a blitz of dark berry, cedar, bramble and graphite aromas. It feels punchy for being a dark-style red, with meaty black-fruit flavors. On the palate, it turns juicier and more rugged as the acidity steps up, ultimately finishing thick but catchy, with peppery spice. A blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet and Merlot."
Red Blend,"This blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot starts with aromas of blue flower, plum, blackberry and spice. Juicy red and black cherry flavors are accented by white pepper, cinnamon and hints of espresso that add depth. It's well-balanced but tight so give this a few more years to soften and develop fully. Drink 2015–2020."
Red Blend,"Bold and pruney, with herbal, soft, ultraripe aromas in front of a jumpy yet partially stewed palate. This blend of Malbec with Bonarda and Syrah is your typical huge, tannic bruiser with big extract, huge tannins and just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Pretty good and perfectly drinkable, but a little over the edge."
Red Blend,"For a whiff, feel and taste of real Chile, this Carmenère-led blend is the ticket. The nose is prickly and intense, with aromas of juniper, leather and spicy black fruit. It's acidic and lively, with firm but smooth tannins and huge flavors of cassis, plum, green herbs, olive and chocolate. On the finish, it delivers structure and length, but also a final wave of herbal, Carmenère-based flavors. Drink now–2018."
Red Blend,"There is an earthy side to this otherwise fruity, smooth, medium-bodied wine. It tastes quite ripe, slightly sweet, with low tannins and not much acidity. Blended from Merlot, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah."
Red Blend,"Supple and structured, this delicious red offers scents of Mediterranean scrub, mint, blue flowers and ripe berries. Made with 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 20% Alicante, the juicy palate delivers Morello cherry, cassis, mocha and wild aromatic herb notes. Supple tannins carry the savory flavors. Enjoy through 2016."
Red Blend,"This medium-bodied, luminous red boasts a pretty fragrance of blue flowers and wild berry. The vibrant, easy-drinking palate doles out crushed raspberry, wild cherry and a hint of clove alongside racy acidity. Enjoy through 2016."
Red Blend,"With so few Mallorcan wines on the market, Anima Negra operates in a vacuum. Thankfully the winery excels with this red made from the local Callet grape. Dry, light, spicy aromas of sandalwood, tobacco and cherry come in front of a medium-bodied, creamy and oaky palate. Flavors of ripe yet spicy cherry and plum finish with notes of wood smoke and baking spices. Drink this unique wine through 2024."
Red Blend,"From the folks at Merryvale, this is a blend of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petite Sirah. Big, dense and juicy, with a dusty tannic underbite, it's bold, brambly and exuberantly delicious."
Red Blend,"A rugged, simple wine, with raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Drink it with everyday fare, like burgers or chicken tacos."
Red Blend,"This blend of Malbec, Bonarda, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is oaky and minty up front, with pencil lead and exotic blueberry aromas. In the mouth, this has a fast pulse, while flavors of Middle Eastern spices, cassis and blueberry finish briny but short."
Red Blend,"Reedy, attractive, classy aromas of red fruits, tobacco and fine herbs are like a red carpet entering the gala. The mouth is structured and tannic but not hard or biting; flavors of red berry, plum and cherry lean towards sweet, while the finish is long, medicinal and on the money. Drink now through 2014."
Red Blend,"Linear and loaded with finesse, this delicate, polished red opens with fragrant blue flower, berry and crushed herb scents. The bright, ethereal palate offers sour cherry, strawberry and a hint of baking spice, framed by silky tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink soon."
Red Blend,"The Carmenère in this Carm-Cabernet-Syrah blend is the lead singer, so expect a touch of minty green and herbal essence. It's a heavyweight in the sense that the mouthfeel is big and the tannins are a little hard. But with airing it unveils classy, spicy berry flavors and wood-based accents of vanilla and butter (20 months in new oak will do that). A big wine that needs some airing. Ready now but can rest well in the cellar for a few more years."
Red Blend,"This is an impressive, rich, smooth wine. Generous and opulent in style, it has weight and firm tannins along with concentrated black fruits. Brisk acidity and a dry finishing touch lend elegance. Drink from 2016."
Red Blend,"Underbrush, mature black-skinned fruit, worn leather and scorched earth aromas lead the way. The firm, chewy palate offers mature plum, juicy Morello cherry, clove, anise and tobacco framed in tightly wound tannins. Drink 2019–2028."
Red Blend,"A bright and easy blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this would taste great with grilled sausage or barbecued chicken. A vein of fresh acidity is followed by notes of black cherry, dried raspberry and mild spice."
Red Blend,"Berry aromas are mildly herbal and a touch grating and abrasive. This Carmenère-led blend is chewy and concentrated, with baked blackberry, fig, chocolate and herbal flavors. A spicy, figgy, herbal tasting finish is lively and fairly deep. Drink through 2019."
Red Blend,"An inspired co-mingling of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese, this wine offers swirls of spicy cinnamon, plum and tobacco. Rounded on the palate and balanced, while rich, the finish delves into clove and black pepper."
Red Blend,"Rich berry and oak-driven spice take center stage in this blend of 70% Montelpulciano and 30% Sangiovese. The palate delivers ripe plum and black cherry, along with notes of sage, spearmint and mocha. It's ready to enjoy now."
Red Blend,"This catchy named, three-grape blend is a nice wine that's sinewy and leathery; overall it ranks as a natural and controlled reflection of Jumilla. The nose is forward and fiery, while the palate has berry-driven ripeness and plenty of oak. Better with food; the tannins are kind of scratchy with nothing to absorb them."
Red Blend,"Earthy berry and gritty toast and leather aromas form a strong, masculine bouquet. This feels flush but also jagged due to hard tannins. Flavors of blackberry, fine coffee, mint and oak lead to a spicy, peppery tasting finish with oaky notes and power. Drink through 2016."
Red Blend,"Big, brawny and not entirely welcoming: this Priorat heavyweight is full of licorice and cool black-fruit and cola aromas. The palate is hard as nails, and only time will tell if it softens and finds a sweeter spot. We think it will; in five years it should trade in the current burnt steak notes and fierce tannins for softer touches and more complex flavors."
Red Blend,"Made with Sangiovese, Merlot and Sagrantino, this opens with subdued, earthy aromas of leafy underbrush, tilled soil, berry and a hint of clove. The palate offers juicy wild cherry, raspberry, nutmeg and white pepper alongside mature and rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2016."
Red Blend,"This straightforward red opens with aromas of scorched earth, ripe dark-skinned fruit, clove and an earthy whiff of game. The palate offers dried plum, ripe blackberry, ground pepper and grilled herb while assertive but fine-grained tannins provide support."
Red Blend,"This kitchen sink-style blend shows a whiff of volatility along with notes of vanilla and cherry candy. The palate is full of sweet, plump fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
Red Blend,"Although the nose and palate are mildly briny and green, there's enough cherry and berry fruit to keep this good-value red's head above water. A slightly grating mouthfeel isn't too punishing, while a long, aggressive finish comes with spice, mint, pepper and a final note of brine and green."
Red Blend,"With a name like this, it should come as no surprise that this is 85% Carmenère (with 15% Malbec and Syrah). This smells like pencil lead, plastic and blueberry. In the mouth, it's chunky but flat, with flavors of plastic, lactic oak and herbal berry fruits. A minty, green finish is oaky and adequate."
Red Blend,"This unusual blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Malbec comes from the folks who own Stagecoach Vineyard high atop Atlas Peak. A bombastically dense and concentrated wine, it's gamy, meaty and brawny all around. Black fruit, tar and tobacco combine to full-bodied effect. It would be best to wait on this one, cellaring through 2020."
Red Blend,"Aromas of underbrush, prune toast and a whiff of crushed blue flower lead the way. The somewhat evolved palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and a hint of espresso alongside dusty tannins."
Red Blend,"This inexpensive red wine has muscle and depth. It's chocolaty, rich and loaded with ripe, supple fruits and smooth caramel. There is plenty of coffee flavor, a sweet and broad mid-palate, and a simple but satisfying finish."
Red Blend,"Made with 80% Nerello Mascalese and 20% Nerello Cappuccio, this opens with aromas of black fruit, subtle oak, toast and vanilla. The palate offers juicy black cherry and raspberry flavors that are lightly accented by notes of clove and chocolate. The tannis are polished."
Red Blend,"This kitchen sink-style blend is made up of Cabernet Sauvignon (32%), Merlot (25%), Grenache (12%), Malbec (10%) and several other varieties. It's fruit forward, with aromas of raspberry jam, herbs and plum. Flavors are lightly sweet, with restrained but rich flavors and a light grip of tannins."
Red Blend,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot with a bit of Norman Beko's estate Syrah shows concentrated blueberry, tobacco, dried dill, leather and sweet cedar aromas on the nose, in accordance with its age. There are elegant purple flower, caramelized fruit and mocha spice flavors on the palate, which is holding up well but should be enjoyed now."
Red Blend,"If it weren't for the wine's stout color and pretty good mouthfeel, we'd sink it. The nose is green and cheesy, and the flavors are also green almost to the point of vegetal. Stemmy on the finish."
Red Blend,"This bold, densely flavored and impressively tannic wine is dry, very well structured and will be interesting to age until 2018–2019. It smells darkly fruity, smoky and spicy, and tastes like cranberry and black cherry, finishing with a firm tang of tannin. It will be best after 2018."
Red Blend,"Aromas suggest berry fruits, spice. A full, creamy, grabby palate is weighty, while flavors of varied black fruits are oaky and chocolaty. On the finish, this tastes roasted and a bit hot, with a note of salt. This is two-thirds Garnacha along with Syrah and Samsó (Carignan)."
Red Blend,"Though labeled a white wine, this more properly may be called a rosé. It's a pale copper color, made from a mix of Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier grapes that were pressed lightly to minimize color extraction prior to fermentation in stainless steel. It offers a mix of tree fruits, toasted nuts and tart acids."
Red Blend,"This pretty rosso has typical fragrances of dark fruit and spice. The palate shows ripe plum and cherry layered with cinnamon notes. It's fresh and ready to enjoy now, and would pair well with pasta dishes or grilled chicken."
Red Blend,"Made from a blend of every local red grape imaginable, this is a serious, impressive wine. Its aromas and flavors conjure up the wild mountain scenery around the vineyard, giving black fruits, dense tannins and acidity. The spice at the end is another reminder of its origins. Drink from 2017."
Red Blend,"This extracted Malbec blend deals full doses of blueberry, blackberry, balsamic vinegar, vanilla and mocha aromas. The palate weighs in on the jammy, overripe side, with almost no acidic cut. Soupy, ultraripe flavors of crème de cassis, carob and prune finish raisiny. Drink this syrupy wine through 2017."
Red Blend,"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Pinotage is complex yet restrained from start to finish. Aromas of red cherry, cranberry and grape fold into vanilla, smoke, fig presserves and a sanguine character. On the palate, these are met with a smooth tannic structure and a rooibos tea note. It is lush and silky in mouthfeel and boasts a long, harmonious finish."
Red Blend,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (55%) and Syrah, a first for this producer. The aromas bring notes of bittersweet chocolate, pencil lead, smoke, barrel spice and black and purple fruit. The flavors are well balanced and tart, supported by grainy wound-up tannins that need some time to unfurl. Give it a short decant if drinking in the near term."
Red Blend,"The nose is rather shy but eventually shows earthy aromas of grilled herb, charcuterie and ground clove. The aromas follow over to the juicy, rather rustic palate along with red cherry and a funky hint of game. It's easy drinking, with loose, somewhat fleeting tannins."
Red Blend,"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of anisette, leather, menthol and forest floor. The dense, juicy palate offers black cherry, coffee, licorice and clove while fine-grained tannins offer support."
Red Blend,"A blend that includes Syrah and Tannat as well as Bordeaux grapes, this is a wood-aged, ripe and rich wine. A tense streak of acidity heightens the effect of the black currant fruits. Spice at the end comes from the wood. Drink from 2016."
Red Blend,"This bright ten-year-old has enticing aromas of red berry, pressed rose, dark cooking spice, leather and a balsamic note. Balancing ripe fruit and finesse, the juicy palate delivers succulent cherry, cranberry, star anise and white pepper set against a backbone of refined tannins and fresh acidity. A savory mineral note closes the lingering finish. It's smooth and enjoyable now but will offer years of fine drinking pleasure. Enjoy through 2027."
Red Blend,"Wiry and volatile aromas of vinegar and saucy berry fruits fail to impress. This Monastrell-Tempranillo blend is hard and tannic, with murky berry flavors that are also a bit weedy. Heat and a lack of ripeness mar the finish."
Red Blend,"The blend is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one-third Petit Verdot, and the PV takes over the bouquet with bright floral aromas. There is some boysenberry fruit, with a strong herbal streak, and the tannins are slightly green and very astringent; the fruit seems buried in contrast."
Red Blend,"Subdued aromas of toast and red berry lead the way on this easygoing red. The simple, rather diluted palate offers sour cherry and a hint of spice alongside soft, fleeting tannins and fresh acidity."
Red Blend,"This is a super Tuscan blend, based on Sangiovese. It's a rustic wine, drily tannic, with sweetish flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola and oak."
Red Blend,"A ripe and sultry selection, this offers upfront oak-derived notes of vanilla, toasted nut, sweet cedar and chocolate sauce. Fruity tones of brandied cherry, mashed raspberry and blackberry preserve provide a solid backbone for the woody, spicy character. The lush, full palate offers waves of tobacco and leather that carry through to the medium-length finish."
Red Blend,"Magnetic aromas of woodsy spice, fine cedar and pure berry fruits are singing a pretty song. This is fresh, ripped and juicy on the palate, with zero excess weight. Rooty, earthy, woodsy blackberry and cassis flavors finish long and with fig, chocolate and toast notes. Hold this world-class red for a few more years, if possible. Drink through 2025."
Red Blend,"A ripe and smooth wine, its wood aging softening the rough edges of the young fruitiness and bringing a touch of elegance. The wine is spicy with licorice as well as the red fruit flavors. It can be aged, so drink from 2014."
Red Blend,"Berry aromas are jammy and sweet smelling. This feels chunky and bit out of shape. Herbal boysenberry flavors come with a green core, while mint, spice, heat and herbal flavors carry the finish."
Red Blend,"Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive."
Red Blend,"Firm and fragrant, this opens with scents of violet, iris, ripe plum and sweet baking spice. The chewy palate delivers dried plum, ripe black cherry, white pepper, anise and clove while fine-grained, polished tannins provide support."
Red Blend,"This deep violet-red blend offers aromas of black cherry, spearmint and freesia. A bright entry fades to tongue-coating tannins, with flavors of black cherry, menthol and orange zest. Slightly chewy tannins linger through the finish, where they are joined by a lustrous vein of acidity."
Red Blend,"A blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Malbec and Petite Sirah from Brassfield's Volcano Ridge Vineyard, this intensely bold wine has an herbal streak and generous layers of blueberry and leathery, mountain-tight tannin. On the finish expect tar and espresso."
Red Blend,"Aged partly in concrete vats and partly in oak, this shows concentrated sensations of ripe plum, sour cherry and raspberry layered with espresso notes. Pair this with grilled vegetables or spicy cheeses."
Red Blend,"As its name suggests, Hedonis ushers forth opulent and indulgent aromas of chocolate fudge, bright berry and exotic spice. The aromatic intensity is impressive, but the palate is tight, linear and compact. There's a pleasing touch of dried rosemary on the finish. Prestige Wine Imports Corp. —M.L."
Red Blend,"Strawberry, white pepper and blue flower aromas segue over to the bright palate along with juicy wild cherry and a hint of clove. It's straightforward and savory, with smooth tannins. Drink soon."
Red Blend,"Saffredi is a beautiful wine, worthy of membership in an elite class of super Tuscan wines from Italy. The blend is Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Alicante and a tiny percentage of Syrah and the overall result is that of plushness, softness and intensity. Aromas include spice, chocolate, blackberry and cherry."
Red Blend,"Spicy, toasty, blackened aromas of cassis and blackberry feed into a fresh, agile, free-moving palate. This Bordeaux-modeled blend tastes of herbal cherry, plum and pepper, while the finish is zesty and blackened in flavor, with crisp acidity creating length. Drink through 2022."
Red Blend,"Less successful than some previous bottlings under this label, the 2008 seems earthier and less fruit-forward, with coffee and tree bark notes dominating this medium-bodied wine. The blend is 55% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre."
Red Blend,"Roasted and dark, with full blackberry and smoked-meat aromas. Organic Tempranillo, Syrah, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon comprise this tight, dark, rugged wine with forward tannins and acidity bolstering cherry, cassis and   cola flavors. Made in the modern, ripe style. Drink now–2010."
Red Blend,"Firmly tannic and rather mouth-numbing even at five years of age. Enters with a hard edge and finishes tough and gritty. Will it age? There are some black cherry flavors inside, but it's a gamble."
Red Blend,"Simple, sweet-tasting and slightly candied, this bouncy drink is best served slightly chilled. Think of it as an introduction to wine—something to explore after white Zinfandel. —J.C."
Red Blend,"This 50-50 blend of Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional works surprisingly well. It has weight, but also a smooth texture and juicy swathes of black plum and red berry fruits. Juicy fruit flavors are encased in a firm, tannic shell that's solid and dark. The wine is drinkable now after decanting, but could benefit from aging until 2016."
Red Blend,"This soft, high-toned wine is more than a little sweet— either a stuck fermentation or intentional residual sugar. Strawberry candy, cracker, and a hint of sweat in the finish."
Red Blend,"Earthy aromas of underbrush, game, overripe berry and tilled soil lead the nose on this soulful wine. The palate offers the same gamy note alongside spiced blackberry, blueberry, orange zest and clove. Firm but fine-grained tannins provide support."
Red Blend,"With plenty of ripe fruit flavors and an apparent touch of sweetness, this tastes smooth, soft and thick in texture, and full in body."
Red Blend,"Classic varietal aromas of fragrant purple flower, wild berry and baking spice jump out of the glass. A blend of Sangiovese and 5% Canaiolo, the juicy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, herb and mocha alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. It's already delicious and well balanced. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,"One might think that a seven-year-old crianza would be fading, but this one isn't. Sure, it's ready to drink now, and cellaring is unnecessary, but the fruit is pure and exciting. The cherry and raspberry character is exact and lively, while the feel is lean and easy. On the finish, which isn't huge, you get a nice reflection of the wine amid some healthy tannins and acids. Almost certainly good with food."
Red Blend,"This is a plush and opulent blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera that opens with bold aromas of blackberry preserves, chocolate, tobacco and spice. The wine is lush, balanced and dense on the close."
Red Blend,"This soft, easy wine is nearing the end of its useful life, so drink up. Made from Syrah, Petite Sirah and other varieties, it's rich in jam, cocoa and wood spice flavors, with a burst of acidity."
Red Blend,"Strongly aromatic of black pepper, this blend of Syrah, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc is herbal like Cab and slightly sour-sweet on the finish."
Red Blend,"Jumpy, punchy berry aromas are high-toned. This blend feels creamy, candied and syrupy. Sweet flavors of baked fruits and Boston baked beans finish with hints of berry syrup."
Red Blend,"Montevetrano is an impressive blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%), Merlot and Aglianico that shows the enormous potential of red wines from southern Italy. It will age 10 years or more, and it already shows deeply sophisticated flavors of tobacco, dry fruit and spice."
Red Blend,"You can almost tell from the look that this is dense and heavy. It has a huge bouquet of wet earth, spice and oak, but not much fruit. In the mouth, it is drying and on the flat side, although still-kicking tannins reach up and grab the palate. The finish is soft and losing life. Some oxidation and overripeness hold it back."
Red Blend,"Fresh and fruity on the nose, this bottling by Joey Tensley and Alex Guarachi shows strawberries and olallieberries as well as crushed black rocks, wet slate and char aromas. Those same fruits power a zesty palate enhanced by lavender and black-tea flavors."
Red Blend,"Made from a blend of Sangiovese, Colorino, Canaiolo and Ciliegiolo, this vibrant Rosso has sensations of black plum, ripe sour cherry, baking spices and Mediterranean herbs. The palate delivers brisk acidity and lithe tannins. Enjoy it soon with substantial first courses like pasta topped with meat sauce or four-cheese gnocchi."
Red Blend,"Rujari is a hearty blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon that opens with a dark, inky appearance and heavy aromas of ripe blackberry, cherry jam, cola and black licorice. The wine imparts a thick but slightly sour feel on the close."
Red Blend,"The nose of this 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot cuvée shows prune and vanilla scents. On the palate, it's simple and easygong, delivering cocoa and black cherry jam flavors. Drink soon."
Red Blend,"Oak, roasted coffee bean and rubber aromas lead the nose. The palate displays oak extract, vanilla, espresso, mocha and mature plum alongside astringent wood tannins that leave a drying finish. It lacks fruit richness."
Red Blend,"Baked plum, truffle and mocha aromas emerge on this blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot. The warm, chewy palate offers ripe black cherry, coffee, vanilla and anise alongside brooding tannins. Drink through 2018."
Red Blend,"Rose, violet, sour berry and tilled earth aromas take center stage in this young red. The easygoing palate offers rounded tannins and wild cherry, black raspberry and clove flavors. A mineral note signals the finish."
Red Blend,"This medium-weight blend of 38% Shiraz, 26% Pinotage, 19% Cab Sauv and 17% Merlot is soft and easy-drinking now with notes of dried black currant, cherry and purple florals alongside fine tannins."
Red Blend,"Aromas of toast, espresso, black-skinned fruit, aromatic herb and a balsamic note lead the way on this powerfully structured wine. The brawny, monolithic palate offers black cherry marinated in spirits, licorice and tobacco alongside assertive, enveloping tannins. You'll also feel the heat of alcohol on the close."
Red Blend,"Deep purple in color, and soupy on the nose, with a strong hint of lemon. The palate is almost astringent due to elevated acidity, thus the balance of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon-Bonarda blend is sketchy. Tastes more like grape juice than fine wine, with a hollow, tangy finish."
Red Blend,"Notes of crushed berries on polished mahogany come to mind. This is elegant and classic, its strucure is firm but not imposing, the tone is one of subtlety and elegance. This stands straight and presents honest, dark fruit and leaves with a long, velvety train of spiced berry, more mahogany and a touch of forest floor Very alluring."
Red Blend,"Aromas of leather, flint, toast, menthol and exotic spice come together in the glass along with a floral note. The full-bodied, firmly structured palate offers mature black cherry marinated in spirits, licorice, and coffee alongside assertive, close-grained tannins and bright acidity. A mineral note closes the finish."
Red Blend,"This is one of the best Tempranillo-based wines in California history. The other varieties blended in are Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Bone dry and tannic, though a little warm in alcohol, it shows its mountain origins—from the southeast corner of the Vacas—with its immaculate core of blackberry and cassis. Compellingly delicious now and over the next 5–6 years."
Red Blend,"This is a strange wine from Puglia, in Southern Italy, with drying aromas of crushed hazelnut and Graham cracker. You'll get peanut butter and almond cookies as well and the fruit aromas resemble prunes and raisins. The blend is 40% Uva di Troia, 40% Montepulciano and 20% Aglianico."
Red Blend,"Made from Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this is an herbal wine marked mostly by cassis and cranberry. The palate is thick with dense tannins and a dusty oak note."
Red Blend,Here's an easy-drinking blend of Cabernet and Corvina (one of the grapes used in the production of Amarone) that would cheerfully supplement a softball game in the park or frisbee tournament. It's totally unassuming and fresh with sour cherry on the close.
Red Blend,"This magenta-colored blend is mostly Bobal, and it smells reduced, with raw raspberry and plum scents. A racy, rubbery and pinching palate holds tart plum and currant flavors. This wine is constrained as a whole, but juicy."
Red Blend,"Made of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with subdued black-skinned fruit and underbrush aromas. It's built for early drinking and delivers ripe plum and cinnamon flavors with supple tannins."
Red Blend,"This first wine of the vintage, a blend of Pinot Noir, Grenache, and Valdigue, is largely the result of carbonic maceration, a winemaking technique that creates the freshest, sharpest, zingiest aromas and flavors imaginable. ItÕs vibrant and juicy, like Beaujolais. The gorgeous ripeness of the fruit bodes well for the 2001 vintage. Great value."
Red Blend,"This is made from declassified barrels originally intended for Stevens 424. It's sharp-edged and spicy, not yet wellintegrated, but substantial, with wild berry flavors and slightly green tannins. A good quaffer, or pair it with a flank steak."
Red Blend,"This easy blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Montepulciano  and Alicante opens with a bright cherry note and slightly bitter tones of spice and almond skin. The palate is smoothly textured and rich."
Red Blend,"Boldly flavored and slightly sweet, this blend of mostly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon smells jammy, tastes ripe and juicy and has a fairly smooth texture with a touch of tannin. The flavors resemble black berry and sweet red cherry, the body is full and the finish is fruity."
Red Blend,"There are slight accents of chocolate and licorice here that sit over a solid core of cherries and blackberries. The wine (a 60-40 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet) is rich and succulent in the mouth and would pair nicely with tomato, ricotta and sausage pasta."
Red Blend,"This wine is all grapey, jammy deliciousness. It's light-bodied, but full of blackberry jam and grape-jelly flavors, and hard to resist."
Red Blend,"Bold and rich, this opens with aromas of baked plum, pressed blue flower, nutmeg and a confectionary note. The ample palate doles out high-toned black-skinned fruit, cocoa, cinnamon and sweet pipe tobacco supported by velvety tannins and uplifted by fresh acidity. It's opulent, but also balanced and poised."
Red Blend,"Fresh and juicy, this easy-drinking blend provides simple mint and cassis aromas and flavors at a reasonable price, with just enough structure to stand up to burgers and the like. Drink now–2013."
Red Blend,"This bright, savory wine delivers aromas and flavors of juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, violet, white pepper and mocha. Polished tannins provide the framework. Enjoy through 2020."
Red Blend,"Potent but integrated oak and blackberry aromas come with a note of licorice. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc is blocky and almost collapses under its own weight. Herbal, spicy flavors of fresh mushroom, roasted plum and tomato are typical of Salta. It finishes full, saturated and a bit chunky. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,"This smooth and inviting blend is impressive for the price. With mildly herbal Carmenère-driven aromas of olive and peppery spice, and then a deep and structured palate feel, Gold is golden. Look for a ton of ripe plum and berry flavor touched up by oak, chocolate and pepper accents. On the finish, it's spicy, peppery, smooth and complete. Drink now–2016."
Red Blend,"A blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot, this opens with aromas of blue flower, plum cake, raisin, mocha and a whiff of resin. The dense palate offers blackberry, plum, vanilla, roasted coffee bean and sage alongside tightly compacted tannins that need to unwind."
Red Blend,"This structured blend of Nero d'Avola, Petit Verdot, Syrah and a small percentage of other grape varieties offers cassis, mocha and underbrush aromas. The dense palate doles out prune, carob, licorice and pipe tobacco notes alongside velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2023."
Red Blend,"The best Sassicaia of the last 10 years, the 2004 vintage is an outstanding achievement. Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc highlight the beauty of Tuscany and portray the region in terms of thick chocolate fudge, succulent cherry and currant, exotic spice and vanilla seed. Beyond those big aromas are little teasers: blue flowers, Mediterranean herbs, cola and light mineral shadings. It's lush and full in the mouth and will hold 20 or 30 years."
Red Blend,"A big blast of roasted berry, herb and spice hits hard on the composed bouquet. Feels stocky and lush, with full tannins, good extract and flavors of herb, black olive, earth, cola and toasty blackberry. Toasted on the finish, with bitter chocolate notes."
Red Blend,"This shows notes of prune and chocolate, but not much complexity or finesse. It has delicious fruit and an approachable palate, but it's a bit one dimensional."
Red Blend,"These quirky labels mark a stylish shift in Temecula, where traditional branding has long reigned, yet the wine is as solid as ever. This blend of 64% Petite Sirah, 13% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Franc, 7% Shiraz and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon shows dried black currant, turned loam, dark chocolate dust and dried mint aromas. The flavors are reminiscent of classic Old World bottlings, with cedar, dried herb and stewed plum laced with fresh acidity and a dry texture."
Red Blend,"This captivating wine treads the line between Rhône and Bordeaux. A splash of Cabernet, though just a fraction of the blend, stands out. The wine has depth and persistence, and the mix of grapes works well, showing brambly red fruits, like a Zin, spice and pepper, like Syrah, and some herbal and leafy tobacco in the finish. Complex, unique and quite appealing."
Red Blend,"This has bright aromas of red currant, cherry and red pepper. The palate isn't very expressive, but it does show some prune and raisin notes, along with a hint of chocolate. It could use a bit more freshness and length, and you'll detect the alcohol. Drink soon."
Red Blend,"Spicy, structured and fruity, this savory wine opens with aromas of ripe berry and dark cooking spice. The full-bodied palate doles out crushed blackberry, plum, black cherry, ground black pepper and star anise alongside firm, velvety tannins."
Red Blend,"This savory selection offers a spicy bouquet of black pepper, nutmeg and clove, along with blackberry and cherry notes. It has a refined and vibrant palate, with black cherry, pepper and spice notes framed by silky tannins and refreshing acidity."
Red Blend,"A blend of almost equal parts Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, supported by smaller percentages of Merlot, Malbec, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, this is a sizable wine. A tight fist of dry wood tannins and tobacco carries a gamy, leathery touch to the finish."
Red Blend,"Chocolate, coconut, plum and coffee aromas lead the nose on this densely concentrated wine. The monolithic palate offers black cherry, chocolate-covered coconut and oak alongside astringent tannins that dry out the mouth."
Red Blend,"Absolutely huge fruit blows out of this bottle as soon as it's opened. A rush of gorgeous black cherry is buoyed by snappy acidity and generously finished with smoke and coffee accents from having aged in 50% new oak. Details of iron and baking spice emerge also, and the silky tannins glide through a lengthy and delightful finish. A blend of 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot."
Red Blend,"Scents of red licorice and candied ruby grapefruit and red berry portend the sweetness of this wine. The palate feels slack, and it comes with noticeable residual sugar. Delicate tannins lend the finish light traction."
Red Blend,"An interesting blend of 37% Carignan, 26% Shiraz, 20% Petit Verdot, 15% Petite Sirah and 2% Viognier, this is a delightful red that offers tons of complexity and character. Black plum, cherry and currant fruit flavors are integrated with herbal notes of sandalwood, cigar spice and licorice root. Round and full but structured with gripping tannins and balanced acidity, and everything carrying through the long finish. Drink now through 2014."
Red Blend,"This is an oak-heavy red wine from Southern Italy that is embellished by aromas of vanilla, toast and spice that sit heavy over a rich core of ripe fruit. The wine is firm and streamlined in the mouth and offers a hint of sour cherry on the close. This vintage represents a huge jump forward in quality compared to 2004."
Red Blend,"Here's a blend of Montepulciano (75%) and Aglianico (25%) with big, ripe intensity and polished tannins. Aromas include sweet cherry, blueberry and spicy cinnamon or vanilla. It feels big and bold in the mouth and would make a statement with lamb or beef."
Red Blend,"Gaseous and minerally on first blush, it has funky, earthy aromas of leaves and olive that could use a hit of freshness. It feels grabby and scratchy, with an olive flavor and a hot finish that has a latex-like character. This is a big wine that misses some elegance."
Red Blend,"This atypical blend brings exceptional fruit to the table, with Pinot Noir sourced from the Dundee Hills and Syrah from Walla Walla. Syrah dominates the aromas, with gamy whiffs of smoke, coffee and and licorice. The tangy black-cherry fruit comes with a streak of balsamic and a hint of pine sap. Though Pinot Noir rarely succeeds with other grapes in the blend, this is the exception that proves the rule."
Red Blend,"This blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon offers fresh blackberries on cold slate and a light herbal character with dill, oregano and tarragon. A minty quality carries into the sip, where black plum, pepper dust and light tar show."
Red Blend,"Aromas of raspberry and blue flower open this lovely wine. The juicy palate offers ripe marasca cherry while cinnamon and white pepper add depth. This isn't very complicated, but who cares—the delicious flavors and smooth tannins make it an absolute joy to drink. Not an ager so enjoy soon."
Red Blend,"This Cabernet and Carmenère blend deals aromas of cedar, cigar, vanilla, tomato, herbs and dried red fruits. A medium-bodied palate is just big enough, tasting of medicinal cherry and chocolate. A lightly woody finish with pepper and cocoa notes provides for a happy ending. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,"This red blend from Moldova is composed of 70% Feteasca Neagra and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon. It has scents of black pepper, black plum juice and a whiff of jalapeño. In the mouth there are flavors of dried plum, cinnamon, clove and persistent sweet tannins in the finish."
Red Blend,"Horsey berry and vinegar aromas lack freshness and appeal. This feels both tight and dilute, while flavors of forced oak, tomato and tart berry fruits finish drawing and bitter."
Red Blend,"A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Malbec, this wine is fresh and fruit filled, with aromas and flavors of plum and black currant, sprinkled with light barrel spices and mocha tones. It shows a lovely sense of balance and poise that kicks it up a notch."
Red Blend,"A very ripe and sweet-smelling wine with thick concentration and deep tones of blackberry, black currant and clove."
Red Blend,"Soft, sweet, hot and underripe, with vegetal flavors. Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah."
Red Blend,"Aromas of ripe dark berry, exotic spice, tobacco and an anise note lead the nose on this intense wine. The succulent palate delivers layers of blackberry, raspberry, clove, licorice and allspice. Tightly-knit but velvety tannins provide support."
Red Blend,"This blend of 68% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Merlot hits the nose with aromas of brick, uncrushed clove, red cherries, wet gravel, rosewater and a touch of tobacco. The palate is surprisingly light, but packs cedar, pipesmoke, clove and nutmeg against a red cherry and cranberry backdrop."
Red Blend,"Ripe, dark and leathery, this full-bodied, rounded wine blends 45% Syrah with 28% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot plus handfuls of Malbec and Petit Verdot. Aged in French and Hungarian oak barrels and puncheons, it shows its heritage in a perfume of woody chewiness and meaty dried herb."
Red Blend,"This bright, medium-bodied red offers aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, ripe plum, ground black pepper, clove, grilled herb and a hint of anise. Firm, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2016–2020."
Red Blend,"Scents of ripe berry, grilled herb, sunbaked soil, violet and menthol lead on this fragrant red. The savory, straightforward palate offers mature black cherry, sage and a hint of anise alongside lithe tannins. Enjoy through 2018."
Red Blend,"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with 7% Syrah and 6% Merlot, this presents wonderfully pure, expressive notes of mint, cassis and vanilla. It just lacks that extra touch of textural richness to put it in the top category. A prebottling sample of the 2007 was more impressive."
Red Blend,Spiced plum and cherry aromas get this live-wire Rioja going. A clawing palate with rubbery tannins needs time to settle. Toasty flavors of black fruits and oak finish with a rubbery texture due to drying tannins. Give this more time; drink from 2018–2028.
Red Blend,"This blend of Syrah and Grenache is hard and tough, with stringy, dry tannins and flavors of vegetables and cherry cough syrup. Lots of new French oak does little to make it more palatable."
Red Blend,"Espresso and baguette notes hit the nose first, followed by accents of mixed berries. Although the minerally and herbal flavors are pleasant, they lack the brio to make this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot a stand out. The malleable texture makes this wine suitable to be paired with a cheesy pizza."
Red Blend,"This Navarran blend opens with spicy raspberry and red currant aromas. The palate is sharp, prickly and edgy in feel, with flavors of cherry tomato, herbs and racy red fruits. The hot, scratchy finish can probably best be tamed with food."
Red Blend,"This mature blend of Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo smells stalky and herbal, with stewed berry notes and a whiff of coffee grinds. The palate is raw and rubbing, while horsey berry flavors suggest underripeness. A soupy, stewy tasting finish feels chunky and obtuse."
Riesling,"There's a savory vein of herbs and smoke that persists from start to finish on this deeply fruity auslese, adding a shade of dimension and complexity. It's zippy in lemony acidity, but silky and sweet, with luscious flavors of preserved peach and tangerine."
Riesling,"While the attack of this dry wine is akin to biting into a perfectly ripened white peach, notes of salt and slate accumulate on the palate, lending a profound impression of minerality. The mouthfeel is rich and full bodied, yet high-toned acidity adds structure and a prolonged finish. It's drinking well now, but still quite taut and should open gorgeously through 2025."
Riesling,"Luscious notes of ripe stone fruit have tropical overtones of pineapple, with some musky notes on both the nose and palate. The ripeness of the pineapple is even more accented in the mouth where it contrasts with totally crisp lime acidity. This is exciting now but has the backbone to age beautifully through 2025 at least."
Riesling,"A promising start for Empire Estate's first bottling, this perfumed dry Riesling is marked by lifted aromas of orange blossom and citrus peel. Concentrated tangerine and honey flavors have an electric vibe, balancing a nervous edge of lemon-lime acidity against a honed, steely polish."
Riesling,Rounded acidity recalls the freshness of green apple and pear rather than that of citrus. Very clean and streamlined but with pleasant substance and just a little enticing spritz. Simple but very pleasant.
Riesling,"Flavors of honey tangerines and quince preserves resonate deeply in this sweet-tangy Riesling full of fruit and blossom flavors. So sprightly and brisk, it dances delicately on the tongue, yet lingers long with a murmur of lime zest astringency."
Riesling,"Intense smoke and crushed-stone notes linger from start to finish on this distinctly mineral beerenauslese, adding a savory tone to luscious honey and lemon flavors. Zesty lime and lemon notes offset sweetness on the palate, finishing with a touch of puckering astringency."
Riesling,"This is a ripe, delicately tropical and fruity wine with rich texture. It is smooth, rounded on the palate, but accompanied by a shot of acidity. The lemon aftertaste hints at a more steely character."
Riesling,"Pure, clean and fresh, this has bright lime and grapefruit flavors that are lined with acidity. The wine has a touch of perfume and is attractively balanced. This is developing quickly."
Riesling,"A finely constructed wine that is likely to age over many years. With its juicy currant flavors still dominated by minerality and citrus, there is some austerity. It is a complex wine showing great terroir character from the steep vineyard site."
Riesling,"A bit of moody musk precedes notes of lifted orange marmalade—bitter-sweet peel countered by juicy lusciousness. The botrytis is palpable here amongst the concentrated sweetness, so wonderfully shot through with lemony acid. A focused, refreshing BA, with swirls of citrus that go on and on."
Riesling,"While taut and intensely mineral, there's a core of juicy grapefruit and honeydew flavors that shine brightly throughout this Riesling. Dry in style, it finishes tightly on zesty lime-pith note. Drink now."
Riesling,"An aromatic wine with notes of freshly cut red apple, overripe pear and jasmine. The palate drinks closer to dry than the aromas might suggest, with a phenolic feel."
Riesling,"Fresh apricot, melon and grapefruit abound from nose to finish in this brisk yet delectably fruity Riesling. It's dry and lithe in body yet penetrating and juicy. Zesty lime acidity lingers brightly on the finish."
Riesling,"This wine shows tremendous minerality for a wine from a mix of parcels. Almost smoky, saline mineral aromas combine with crisp, citrusy fruit to typify the Pfalz dry Riesling style. Picks up hints of orange and clove on the finish, with a suggestion of citrus pith."
Riesling,"The “**” designation on this wine indicates the exceptional selection process used to pick intensely ripe, late-harvest grapes for this Auslese. Just a hint off dry, it's exceptionally full bodied with a rich, minerally palate accented by flecks of sweet stonefruit and honey. Brisk acidity offsets the voluptuous mouthfeel."
Riesling,"Tasted with over a decade of bottle aging, this late-release Spätlese is a heart-stopper. The core of this delicately honeyed wine is still vibrantly fruity, concentrated in luscious yellow peach and cherry flavors. Intonations of maturity show in glimpses of creamy cashew, dried mushroom and crushed rock that extend from nose to finish. It should maintain its spry, electric feel from now through 2021 at least."
Riesling,"It's a pleasure to see another winery determined to explore the potential of Oregon Riesling, here sourced from a top site in the Ribbon Ridge AVA. Ripe, round and rich, this offers a complex mix of grilled peach, pineapple and papaya fruit, with a lively touch of mint. The underpinning of wet stone minerality adds length and texture. This belongs among the very best Rieslings from the state."
Riesling,"Although this winery is better known for its Shiraz, I have been a consistent fan of its Riesling as well. The 2006 offers scents of powdered minerals and lime followed by flavors of apple and citrus. It's medium-bodied but muscular, with plenty of intensity that comes through on the long finish. Drink now–2016."
Riesling,"Ripe, juicy flavors of pink grapefruit and peach are accented by sprightly hints of lemon and cherry blossom in this moderately sweet, delicate Riesling. A shock of lemon-lime acidity and a zesty mineral tone lingers long on the finish."
Riesling,"The nose is shy and merely hints at lemon zestiness. The palate also opens with lemon zest but in a very concentrated full-on fashion with a citrus blast. There is a softer touch of orange and tangerine, too. The freshness is bundled and has ample drive and energy. This certainly is juicy, citrus fresh and off dry. The finish is whistle-clean and very refreshing."
Riesling,"A nice racy version, with lots of petroleum and peach character shot through with notes of wet stone. Ends on a lingering grapefruit peel tone. Try with sweet and sour pork. Drink now."
Riesling,"Hints of savory earth mingle with fresh apple notes. The palate has the bright mellow freshness of ripe oranges and the juiciness of ripe pear. A core of bright lemon acidity makes for a clean, bright and refreshing finish."
Riesling,"This offers the vinous elements of fruit cocktail, combining hints of peach, pear and citrus in the glass. That fruit mélange tightens up on the finish, reined in by an extra squirt of mouthwatering lime."
Riesling,"Rich, sticky swirls of caramel and honey fill the palate of this lip-smacking sweet Riesling. It's slight in body and electric with acidity, yet its heaving, sun-kissed tropical fruit flavors persist boldly on the finish. Stunning already, it's sure to improve through 2030."
Riesling,"The wine is tight, tangy and crisp. It has hints of the perfumes that are typical of Riesling although it's more of a fresh, lively wine that has lightness and plenty of acidity at the end."
Riesling,"Pristine, primary tangerine and grapefruit flavors shine brilliantly throughout this crisp, light-footed Spätlese. It's dangerously quaffable, yet nuanced by shades of candlewax, mineral and saffron that extend the finish dramatically."
Riesling,"This fruit-driven wine lacks a touch of minerality but features admirably pure, focused notes of perfectly ripe apples, pineapple and citrus. It's a sweet, medium-bodied spätlese that's plump and succulent, delicious sipped on its own on a warm summer evening. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC."
Riesling,"All from Windrige Vineyard, this is an aromatic, appealing dessert-style wine with notes of dried pink grapefruit and honey. At 18.6% residual sugar, it's rich and concentrated, with good depth and intensity."
Riesling,"Clouds of aromatic flower play along with zesty orange flavors. Grapefruit provides spice and drive. The palate shows that counterpoint of ripeness and tartness that makes this so very moreish. This is juicy and powerful, yet precise and toned despite all its generosity. This is a light, tightrope walk between two thrilling worlds. It's full of life and joy with an endless finish."
Riesling,"Riper notes of pink grapefruit and tangerine distinguish this dry Riesling from Georg Albrecht Schneider's other 2014 wines. The palate is cutting and crisp, showcasing tart limes and gooseberries against a blossomy finish. Drink now."
Riesling,"A terrific auslese, sweet but balanced near perfectly by lime-like acids. It's stony yet honeyed, concentrated yet somehow light on its feet. Then it's bright, fresh and full of juicy citrus fruit on the finish."
Riesling,"The nose suggests ripe, bruised apples and a touch of apple crumble, while the palate also has a mellow aspect, helped along by a little residual sugar to make this wine off dry. Sufficient freshness balances things out but the overall impression is one of rounded mellowness. Lemon becomes apparent on the finish."
Riesling,"Soft perfume susbsumes citrus, apple and peach. All three are referenced in equal measure on the dry, clean palate. This has a soft aspect but is nonetheless fresh, taut, concentrated and linear. It comes with huge charm and clarity and finishes with pure, zesty dryness and pure, pervasive and lasting apple notes. Still young, oozing potential. Drink 2017–2030."
Riesling,"This is a grand, complex wine, full of ripe apple, dried apricots and pear skins. It is just beginning to hint at more mature, complex flavors. With great acidity that cuts right through the palate, this serious, dense wine will age well. Drink until 2022."
Riesling,"This is attractive and mature, with a light touch and flavors of currants mingling with almonds. Soft yet tangy, this is very ready to drink."
Riesling,"One of Trimbach's top wines, this impressive Riesling, with all its bottle time, is maturing beautifully. It has that petrol character that is typical of aged Riesling, as well as a strong sense of steeliness and intense acidity on the finish. It is probably at its peak now, but will drink well until 2018."
Riesling,"The Westhofen Morstein seems the most vibrantly citrusy among Wittmann's 2014 GG bottlings. Its lemon-lime acidity is almost puckering, but cushioned by creamy textured layers of tangerine, grapefruit and yellow cherry flavor. It's a powerful, elegant wine with a deep mineral finish. Drinks well now but should intensify in minerality through 2020."
Riesling,"This is just a bit on the sweet side, but there is plenty of acidity to be found. It's fruity, peachy, succulent and fresh."
Riesling,"Aromas of Bosc pear, apple, diesel and apricot lead to elegant fruit flavors. It drinks just a hair off dry. The concentration seems a bit wanting but what's there is well balanced."
Riesling,"Here's another exceptional Oregon Riesling to add to the growing ranks of top producers. Lemon-drop fruit meets peaches and cream in the mouth, as this off-dry (20g/L) wine displays a spot-on balance between acid, sugar, fruit and honey. This is delicious already, and built to age nicely over a decade or longer."
Riesling,The main thing to know about this Riesling is that It's quite sweet in oranges and pineapples. The all-important acidity is a little too soft for balance.
Riesling,"Waxy white florals and lifted apple aromas add freshness to slightly cider-like flavors of pressed apple and mulling spice in this dry Riesling. Delicately light bodied it has a brisk, refreshing finish."
Riesling,"Subtle touches of mineral oil lend richness and depth to spry white floral, lemon and lime notes in this light-footed dry Riesling. Bursts of white grapefruit flavor dominate the midpalate, marking a brisk, clean finish. Drink now through 2017."

This has the generous ripeness of plump stone fruit and the edgy freshness of tart, fragrant citrus zest. The palate is precise, streamlined and clean; the finish tells of purity and lasting power. Enjoy now through 2035."
Riesling,"This is rich both on the nose and on the palate. Full and rounded, it has spice and currant flavors. There is a burnt-almond bitterness that marks the finish."
Riesling,"The wine is finished at 1.2% residual sugar, but tastes bone dry. It's succulent and juicy, with floral aromas, stone fruits and hints of honeysuckle. Concentrated and dense, it is both bracing and long. The bottle was re-tasted on the second and third days after being opened and retained its crispness and vitality beautifully."
Riesling,"One whiff reveals billowing scents of purple flower, fresh apple, lemon peel and sea salt. Bone dry yet penetrating with flavors of lime skin, green apple and fresh herbs, this is a lush, textural Riesling with outstanding complexity. It finishes steely and crisp —a perfect pairing with fatty hamachi or salmon sashimi."
Riesling,"Classic varietal smells of chalk and golden raisin emerge from this wine. It's lusciously smooth once sipped, with orange, limestone and vanilla pudding leaning up against bitter greens and just-ripe nectarine. Serve with beets and goat cheese or Chinese chicken salad."
Riesling,"This powerful, concentrated wine hails from the steep granite slopes of the Sommerberg. It is packed with both acidity and structured white fruits and citrus.

Riesling,"Honey, lime rinds and just ripe peach greet the nose on this dry single-vineyard expression by Michael Callahan.

Riesling,"Despite having 12.5% alcohol, the palate impression is not sweet. Instead, it's bright and tangy, with flavors of citrus pulp and citrus rind. Notes of orange and tangerine dominate the bright, bracing finish."
Riesling,"The finely tuned sweetness of this Auslese brings out the muskier notes of apple: a mix of fresh and baked fruit, with peeled skin and compote flesh. Initially, there still is the spectre of yeast but with some time there are hints of burnt sugar and apricot compote, too. A lovely, engulfing apple tartness makes this as suited to baked fruit desserts and fruit tarts as to creamy, ripe cheeses. Full marks for poise and freshness. This is a baby still and will need time to come into its own and unfold even more layers. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,"Sassy and refreshing, this Riesling bursts with lime, mandarin, Seville orange and Amalfi lemon on a clean-cut but concentrated palate."

Riesling,"Lavishly perfumed with hints of honeysuckle, musk melon and pear, this animated Riesling exhilarates the senses. Juicy and fresh with pristine stone-fruit flavor, it glides effortlessly yet endlessly on the palate. Enjoy now for its gorgeous perfume, but save a few bottles through 2020 to let the stately elegance shine through."
Riesling,"The 2011 vintage created wines with underripeness and low alcohol, and this Riesling attempts to cut the sourness with its 2.4% residual sugar. It comes across as a mix of lemon juice, orange juice, and simple sweetness."
Riesling,"While the nose is restrained, the palate of this off-dry Riesling bursts with sweet, luscious pink grapefruit, guava and peach flavors. It's refreshingly crisp, yet deeply concentrated with a lingering, almost berried touch of sweetness on the finish. Drink now–2016."
Riesling,"While the nose reveals only faint whiffs of apples, nuts and brambles, the palate of this off-dry Riesling is crisply concentrated with fresh red apples and tart peaches. It's not a deeply persistent wine, but finishes brisk and bright."
Riesling,"A bouquet of summer desserts—strawberry soup, apricot pie and lemon meringue pie—pull you into the glass. Although not quite as nuanced, the palate delivers enticing apricot and wet stone notes. The unctuous palate and noticeable residual sugar will partner well with fish in an Asian-fusion preparation."

Riesling,"Stony, peachy notes are evident on the nose. The palate confirms these and majors on that stony, structural framework. Pervaded as it is by ripe stone fruit flavor of yellow plum and peach, there is a pleasant bitter edge, reminiscent of honey. This is an exciting tightrope walk between the slightest smidgeon of residual sweetness and electric acidity, finishing dry. Ready now, will drink well until 2018."
Riesling,"The pairing possibilities with this wine seem endless: seafood of all kinds, chicken, pasta salad, maybe pork, but it'd also make perfect sense to drink it as an aperitif. Clean and dry in the mouth, mineral and chalk are at the fore, with lime pith, soy and grass underneath. Finishes medium-long, with more of the same."
Riesling,"Lime zest and white pepper notes are invigorating on the nose and palate of this piercing dry-style Riesling.

Riesling,"The nose is still shy, with hints of lemon. This note also characterize the slender, dry and still-taut palate which also has a textured earthy element on which these lovely bright citrus accents are displayed. The finish is dry on this slender, young wine. Drink 2017–2025."
Riesling,"There's a nice intensity of pineapple, guava and hoppy, floral aromas on the nose of this estate-grown Riesling. Racy and linear on the light-bodied palate, tart tropical fruits meet a chalky midpalate and carry to a brisk citrus finish."
Riesling,"A sweet smell of honeysuckle and grapefruit candy permeates the nose of this bottling, along with cut honeydew melon and apple blossom. Sugary mandarin juice is the primary flavor on the palate, but it's properly offset by acidity a chalky texture."
Riesling,"Stacked layers of crystalline minerality add lift to this luscious, ripe Riesling. It's dry in style with restrained apple and pear flavors, but the texture is clingy and dense. Chalk and saline notes reverberate on the finish."
Riesling,"This is a bit stinky right out of the bottle, with some sour, rotten egg aromas. Ultimately they blow off, but there's still a palate impression of sulfur and burnt match. The net effect is to put a damper on the fruit, which pokes through the sulfurous fog tasting rather soapy and limpid."
Riesling,"A crystalline purity persists from nose to finish in this dry, mineral Riesling. Tart white peach and pear flavors are showered in shards of mineral and crushed rock and an electric streak of lime acidity. It's ethereally light in texture but finishes with persistence. Ready to drink now but will continue to improve through at least 2025."

Riesling,"The fragrant floral nature of Riesling shines through on the fresh nose. The palate also holds this lemony freshness, harnessed by small bubbles fizzing away on the lively, slender, dry palate. A streak of lemony acidity adds some extra brightness."
Riesling,"Chamomile blossoms seem to perfume this delicately fruity, floral wine. Medium-sweet in style, it's dainty and spry, showering the palate with sweet Meyer lemon, lime and honey. It's pristine through a long meandering finish."
Riesling,"This slightly sweet but utterly fresh bottling shows lime zest, honey dust, ripe red apples, lemon candy and spicy jasmine on the nose. There is nearly effervescent acidity on the palate, with strong night-jasmine notes, orange blossom and lemon verbena spicing up the apple-driven fruit core."
Riesling,"For a 2009, this has wonderfully vibrant and racy acidity, which balances its slight sense of sweetness perfectly. Scents of petrol and damp moss give way to tart apple, pineapple and citrus flavors, which finish long and crisp."
Riesling,"There are two Ovum Memorista Rieslings; this one sports the label with the whale drawing. It's a block selection, and combines distinct flavors of apple candy and sour lemon. Not yet entirely knitted together, it's an interesting though puzzling wine, which shows some early signs of oxidation."
Riesling,"Pretty flavors of pink grapefruit and stone fruit are cloaked in rich swathes of fennel, honey, petrol and spice on this expressive, penetrating wine. Sweet-tasting and juicy, it bristles with streaks of acidity and astringency. It's already showing its stripes, but it should be even more exciting in five years."

Riesling,"Yeasty roundness meets opulently ripe fruit: red-cheeked apple, yellow pear and juicy yellow peach. The spicy verve of grapefruit zest pulls it into focus. This interplay on fruit and freshness dominates the midpalate majestically and has a staying citrus-power."
Riesling,"Wilting white flowers, tangerine and jasmine aromas are followed by light but sweet fruit flavors, with the sugar providing much of the appeal."
Riesling,"Lightweight and possessed of brisk acidity, this tart and snappy style might work well with fresh shellfish. Simple sour-apple flavors scour the palate."
Riesling,"Citrus blossoms and lime zest perfume this fragrant little showstopper. Dry in style, it's a spry, delicately-framed wine, yet lusciously concentrated in peach and melon flavors. Streaks of lemon-lime acidity catapult a long, penetrating finish."
Riesling,"Peach and blossom notes abound on this delightfully fresh fruity wine. Its sunny stone-fruit flavors are concentrated and juicy, balanced against zesty lime acidity and a meandering pollen finish. Sprightly in texture yet buoyant."
Riesling,"Honeycomb and crushed rocks, preserved peach and citrus rind mix lavishly in this creamy, feather-light TBA. A bracing strike of acidity jolts through the midpalate, but finds ease in layers of mouth coating honey and wax that meander through an endlessly lingering finish. Stunning now, but will evolve well for decades to come."
Riesling,"While intensely fruity, a deep vein of crushed-slate minerality extends from nose to finish in this lithe Kabinett. Lip-smacking honey and peach flavors penetrate through the palate, electrified by a laser of lemon-lime acidity. Finishes remarkably dry and fresh."

Riesling,"The nose of this powerfully fruity yet dry Riesling packs a punch, with aromas of ripe pineapple, apricot and floral potpourri. The palate is dense with stone fruit, and a hint of red berry flavor, but finishes elegantly with sleek mineral tones."
Riesling,"Gorgeous minerality is the underpinning of this estate bottling. Heaps of dry extract amplify racy lemon and lime flavors. Despite its low alcohol, this wine has exceptional concentration and power."
Riesling,"The sweetness gauge on the back label indicates this as medium dry, and at 3.2% residual sugar, there is more than a hint of sweetness. It's all in fine balance, full flavored, fruity and round. A mix of peaches, apricots and Mandarin oranges makes this an interesting Riesling with some complexity."
Riesling,"Quite viscous, with creamy peach, melon and pear flavors at its core. An odd mineral note sticks out, though, while the finish could use a touch more acidity."
Riesling,"Crisp, cutting pineapple and lemon acidity lends raciness this otherwise sunny kabinett full of sweet honeydew, apricot and peach flavors. It's a sprightly, briskly balanced wine with an easy-drinking, approachable feel. Drink now through 2020 to enjoy its freshness."

Riesling,"Seemingly dripping with honey and nectar, this lush, intensely concentrated Riesling is dense, with sweet white-peach, grapefruit and pear flavors. Veins of of dusty slate and sharp lemon-lime acidity add complexity and elegance to the long, lingering finish."
Riesling,"Freshly cut red, yellow and green apples make both nose and palate very fruity. The dry palate with its lemony freshness and open aspect lets all the apple flavors shine and inflects them here and there with baked and dried apple, too. Wonderfully fruity and pure."
Riesling,"Forward, fruity swathes of peach and apple verge on overrripe in this off-dry, slightly fleshy Riesling. Vibrant lemon acidity balances the palate out neatly on the finish. Drink now."
Riesling,"This is off-dry, similar to a kabinett in style. Scents of flowershop greens, green apple and lime give a zesty first impression, confirmed by crisp acids, light-medium body and a lingering, mouthwatering finish. The end result is balanced, delicate and intense at the same time."
Riesling,"Crisp and fresh aromas of pineapple and melon lead on this pretty semi-sweet Riesling, and are followed by slightly sweet, floral flavors that are kept light with a citric, minerally backbone. Pair with chicken salad, Thai cuisine, even curry."
Riesling,"Tart greengage plums join grapefruit and lemon in this fresh, light-bodied offering. Traces of yeast add some midpalate texture to a very refreshing, easy-drinking wine."
Riesling,"Intense and bright with a wonderfully complex nose of slate and stones, combined with elegantly subdued florals. It's dry, but there's a whisper of lemon drop sweetness throughout. Beautifully balanced with an intensely mineral, steely finish."
Riesling,"Clean, taut green apple and zesty lemon are the chief markers of this slender, dry wine. It holds lots of refreshment and has a racy core. Have this on its own when in need of refreshment, or have it with food when there is light, subtle fare."
Riesling,"Intentionally skewed toward the drier side of kabinett, this is an impressive effort from proprietor Raimund Prüm. It's light in body, with fairly ripe fruit flavors of honeyed apple and a hint of apricot, yet intensely refreshing thanks to crisp acidity. Drink now."
Riesling,"For being a goldkap, this is not especially lush or botrytized. Instead, it features a fine balance of acidity, which enlivens the green apple and citrus flavors and gives them extra poignancy. This is crisply balanced and mouthwatering on the finish."
Riesling,"Tender notes of citrus appear at first through a veil of yeast. Their zestiness then fills out with subtle, earthy spice. On the light, dry palate, the true subtlety hits: wafts of lemon, aromatic wild thyme, Seville orange zest, fresh apple peel and wet stone. The delicacy of the concentrated body is astonishing, with a central vein of lemony freshness that provides a focal point. So subtle, so layered and alive: with every new sip new nuances occur."
Riesling,"Persistent lines of smoke, petrol and crushed slate hint to the maturity of this dry, elegantly framed Riesling. The palate is racy and tart, balancing crisp white peach and lemon notes with a mineral-oil slick that elongates and intensifies the finish."
Riesling,"Spine tingling lime and tangerine notes go head to head with sweeter apricot and yellow cherry flavors in this revitalizing sip. It's delicate in body yet deeply penetrating, filling the palate with staccato hits of honey, fruit and acidity. Drinks beautifully now but should improve through 2025."
Riesling,"An intense wine that has powered, nervy acidity, lots of citrus with lime zest. The wine is still young and should be aged to become an impressive Riesling."
Riesling,"There is a whole orchard full of apples here: crisp and green, yellow and juicy, red and mellow and also the very aromatic red-cheeked kind. These aromas fill nose and palate and present a wonderful balance between fruity richness and absolute zesty freshness. This is lissom, dry and light bodied but full of flavor with a very mellow apple finish."
Riesling,"Zesty, waxy aromas of lime peels and crushed stones belie the bright grapefruit and tangerine flavors in this dry, yet deeply mineral-laden Riesling. It's softly textured on the palate, with bright yet lenient acidity that leads into a lingering lemon-lime finish."
Riesling,"Mellow, rounded and ripe notes of fresh and baked apples promise a rich wine. The palate is more sprightly and lends plenty of gingery, peppery spice to all the abundant apple fruit. This is wired and lively, dry but very fruity and unusually spicy with a fine backbone of bright, lemony freshness. Drink soon."
Riesling,"While scents of lemon and dried tarragon seem savory on the nose, this sweet, delicately textured Riesling drips with sweet pineapple and honey flavors. The palate shrieks with lemon-lime acidity, but balances squarely with a lingering kiss of blossom."
Riesling,"The three Himmelreich '09 spätleses tasted were all terrific, with this example showing great intensity and power without excessive weight. Apple and lime notes are underscored by something akin to liquid slate, while citrus notes linger on the long, vibrant finish."
Riesling,"Pure in character, this has a taut line of perfumed white fruits, with a nervy, tight character. It is young, needing several years of aging to bring out its complex flavors."
Riesling,"Tender apple and pear notes make for a fresh, crunchy toned-down palate. The fresh fruit is highlighted by lemon freshness; likewise the almost fizzy midpalate finishes with off-dry lemon hints."
Riesling,"Fresh, cutting gooseberry and grapefruit flavors persist from nose to finish in this exquisitely light bodied Riesling. The palate is off-dry in style, suggesting sweet-tart tangerine and apricot accented by shades of green herb and bramble. The finish is brisk but clean. Drink now through 2020."
Riesling,"Initial impressions are smoky and savory, but the nose opens to reveal aromas of freshly pressed apple, lemon and crushed minerals. The palate is ripe with sunny tangerine and yellow peach flavors, but moderated with piercingly tart lemon-lime acidity. Finishes moderately long on a sumptuous honey-tangerine note."
Riesling,"Light bodied and highly aromatic in petrol, waxy apple and pear, this vineyard-designate is crisp and floral, with buoyant acidity. It lists the residual sugar at 9 g/L but tastes more dry than sweet, finishing with a touch of cream."
Riesling,"Exuberant and floral on the nose, this Riesling is intense and fruity on the palate, with concentrated apple-jelly and peach flavors. Brightened by lime-inflected acidity, the long finish extends with a delicious waxy streak."
Riesling,"While initially a bit musky and waxy on the nose, this Riesling gains strength on the palate as it offers rich honey and red apple flavors. The lemon-lime-like acidity lingers on the finish."
Riesling,"Lightly sweet and simply fruity, this wine tastes a bit like peaches and has a gentle texture."
Riesling,"This is intoxicating on the nose with scents of white flowers, fresh herbs and honey, layered with hints of smoke and pine needles. Just a shade off-dry, the palate boasts ample peach and pear flavors that are tinged with a bitter lime-skin note and bristling minerality."
Riesling,"Promising juicy ripeness of peach and mirabelle appears on the nose. The palate takes this rounded fruitiness and frames it with intense lemon freshness. The palate is concentrated and fluid, shot through with freshness and verve. Dry and refreshing."
Riesling,"A touch of flinty funk hovers on the nose. The palate at first unfurls in a grapefruity zesty texture on which riper notions of pear and peach, quince and smoke are displayed. The merest touch of residual sweetness lends a baroque sheen to this tableau, always countered by spicy zesty freshness while being so seductive. The dry whistle-clean finish still tingles with that aromatic fruit of the concentrated midpalate. A great expression of the great 2015 vintage: rich but streamlined, seductive but contained and therefore all the more intriguing. Drink now through 2035."
Riesling,"This wine's unassuming nose belies the thrilling depth of juicy, sweet white peach, tangerine and quince flavors that burst on the palate. Luminous fruit and spine tingling acidity collide, hinged by a kick of phenolic bitterness that lingers on the finish."
Riesling,"Fresh green floral and lime zest lend vibe to this fine-footed, almost feather-textured kabinett. It's spry but surprisingly powerful, amplified by soaring grapefruit acidity and penetrating green-apple and pear flavors. Finishes long with a delicately honeyed touch. Drink now through 2021."
Riesling,"Earthy hints of pollen and crushed minerals lend complexity to honeyed swathes of peach and raspberry in this delicately framed auslese. It's racy and lithe, yet remarkably penetrating through a long finish."
Riesling,"The nose is slightly subdued with a faint touch of lemon balm and orange. The palate unpacks this with notes of both citrus and earth. There is something textured about that earthy feel, while all the freshness of lemon and orange zest dazzles the senses. This has purity and precision which lend a sense of weightlessness despite the undoubted power of the wine. The finish is wonderfully dry, refreshing and absolutely lip-smacking. Drink 2017–2030."
Riesling,"An immediately enticing wine, with great balance between acidity and honey. There are lemon flavors along with a dry edge. It's a concentrated wine that slides over the mouth. With the acidity, it could age several years."
Riesling,"Off-dry Riesling, rich, ripely textured and with great depth. This is a slightly spicy wine, full in the mouth and perfumed. Acidity gives shape and freshness to this apple and lime flavored wine. Drink after 2015."
Riesling,"Zesty lemon and lime aromas add elegance to unctuous white peach and apricot flavors on this delicate, yet remarkably complex wine. Off-dry in style, it balances a youthful fruit profile with nuanced shades of smoke and earth. Nervy citrus acidity drives a long, focused finish."
Riesling,"There's a classic touch of petrol on the nose of this bottling, as well as richer notes of candied lemon, marmalade, preserved lime and dried citrus. On the palate, it's oily and viscous, but honey, lemon syrup and tangerine zest flavors lighten it considerably. A great all-around experience."
Riesling,"Subtly scented with orange rind and spice, this dry Michigan Riesling has pleasant apple and orange zest flavors accented by brisk black tea notes that leave a pronounced astringency on the palate. An easy-drinking choice from an up-and-coming wine region."
Riesling,"This Riesling's fruit is from a 70-year-old Eden Valley vineyard; half the wine was vinified by Jeff Grosset at Polish Hill, the other half was vinified by Rob Hill Smith at Yalumba. Once the wine was all brought together, Grosset and Hill-Smith, as the story goes, took four days to decide on the final blend. The wine's at once viscous and very dry, with stone fruit, vanilla bean and some floral flavors. Green apple rounds out the long, dry finsih."
Riesling,"Shows green fruit and slightly herbal nuances on the nose, then delivers crystalline structure and purity of lime fruit and liquid minerals in the mouth. Although only light to medium in body, this is a powerhouse, with a long finish."
Riesling,"A new offering from this partnership, this wine brings aromas of jasmine, lime and dried Nestea Ice Tea. It tingles the palate with lightly spritzy, off-dry lemon and peach flavors with a floral finish."
Riesling,"This is an excellent Harvest Select bottling, with bright, sappy flavors that seem not all that sweet. The residual sugar, listed at 47 g/L, is an asset, but doesn't dominate. Flavors remain as crisp as a fresh Macintosh apple, juicy, forward and delicious."
Riesling,"This is reminiscent of a very well-done fruit cocktail. Grape. melon and pear mingle amongst citrus freshness with some tropical hints of lychee mixed in. Wonderfully fruity, rounded and fresh with a zesty seam of acidity."
Riesling,"Brisk in acidity, this Riesling is absolutely dry, although it offers a sunburst of ripe apples, Meyer lemons and spices. There's a touch of that telltale diesel fuel for interest. With low (13.4%) alcohol, it's easy to drink. Fine now with halibut, trout, or with a simple but elegant grilled chicken."
Riesling,"Intensely aromatic with scents of ripe stone fruit and exotic mango, this delicately structured Riesling reverberates with acidity and fine, focused minerality. Semidry in style, it finishes long with lip-smacking fruitiness."
Riesling,"A hint of green-floral perfume wafts amidst notes of honey and apple on this off-dry Riesling. Spine-tingling with acidity, it's balanced with sweet yellow peach and cherry flavors. Irresistibly easy drinking, it finishes moderately long."
Riesling,"From the single vineyard Engelreich—which translates to the angel's kingdom—this is rich, with a concentration of perfumed fruit and intense layers of minerality. It has spice, kiwi and pink grapefruit flavors. This is a wine that needs to age for several years. Screwcap."
Riesling,"This wine boasts a great combination of sweetness and richness with elegance and finesse. Aromas are honeyed and floral yet minerally, while the flavors run toward pears and peaches steeped in honey. The finish is undeniably rich, but supercharged by a lively skein of citrusy acids."
Riesling,"Intensely mineral tones of slate and granite radiate against a backdrop of blossom, grapefruit and peach in this classic Mosel kabinett. Zesty and spry, it's irresistibly inviting, sip after sip after sip."
Riesling,"Exotic spice notes accent ripe yellow-peach and apricot aromas on the nose of this briskly composed, dry Riesling. The palate is intensely mineral, with layers of wet stones and crushed earth that lend a savoriness to delicate fruit and floral flavors. Finishes long, with a note of lime zest."
Riesling,"Fresh, fragrant orange peels and rose petal notes perfume this dry-style Riesling. The palate has a ripe yet slightly muted tone of marmalade and dried citrus-peel. Racy, lemon-edged acidity brightens the finish."
Riesling,"For fans of mineral, slate-driven Rieslings, this should be a hit. The aromas are of dusty slate, while the wine's flavors add petrol notes to the impression of liquid slate. Unlike many Mosel wines, there's not much in the way of fruitiness, despite the wine's plumpness. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC."
Riesling,"Lush mango and guava notes lend a sunny, tropical feel to this Riesling. Dry and lavishly textured, it's concentrated in fruit, yet maintains a mineral-edged vitality that's quite refreshing. It offers remarkable quality and consistency at a bargain price."
Riesling,"Round on the palate for a Riesling, with plumpness and sweetness to the midpalate that's balanced by hints of pink grapefruit and passion fruit and a fresh, clean finish. Patio wine."
Riesling,"This broad, mouthfilling dry Riesling features powerful flavors of baked apple and dried spices, uplifted and amplified by oily, minerally accents. It's just a touch off-dry, balanced on the finish by crisp acids and pronounced minerality."
Riesling,"An off-dry, organically farmed, 100%-varietal wine, this tiny production offering comes from an appellation better known for other varieties, but that shows finesse here. Fruity and balanced, the sweetness comes mostly in aromatic form, with a bouquet of pungent white flowers. Medium bodied, it shows an abundance of lithe fruit, finishing with a powerful kick of minerality."
Riesling,"From a producer with a generally good track record for off-dry Riesling comes this delightfully crisp, fruity wine. With a touch of white sugar in the background, it shows brisk flavors of limes, peaches, green apples and vanilla."
Riesling,"Marked by potent aromas of green apple and lime sherbet, this is an intense, flavorful Riesling that just lacks that little bit of finesse. It's dry and medium-bodied, with a slightly oily, slightly coarse texture. Drink it young."
Riesling,"Melon, peach and a delicate wisp of smoke are aromatic on this off-dry Riesling with bristling acidity. It's lean and light in style, but concentrated with juicy stone fruit and melon flavor. Finishes steely and long."
Riesling,"Lots of racy acidity in this wine, which cleans the mouth and gets those tastebuds watering. It's dry, with zesty grapefruit and lime flavors, accented with an oily touch of petrol. An elegant, exotic wine for cocktail sipping to get the evening started."
Riesling,Straightforward apple and lemon flavors are bright and fresh on this zesty off-dry Riesling. It's not deeply concentrated but subtle honey sweetness lingers nicely. Drink now.
Riesling,"Earthy, herbal notes on the nose and palate lend an elegant, savory tone to the sweet peach and apricot flavors. It's brisk and bright with acidity, with a delicate, almost fragile mouthfeel."
Riesling,"Crushed slate and mineral notes lend elegance to decadent yellow cherry and pineapple notes on this juicy semi-sweet Riesling. Ripe and lush yet brisk with acidity, it's an approachable, irresistible and squarely balanced wine."
Riesling,"Lime sherbet and wet-stone aromas are classic for the variety and region. This is a light- to medium-bodied wine, dry, with high acidity that drives it through a long, zesty finish. Drink it now with raw oysters or ceviche, or cellar it another five years to develop greater weight and complexity."
Riesling,"Confected but pleasant aromas of cotton candy and sour apple drops dominate the nose, while the palate unfolds nicely with layers of lemon and red apple. Soft and lush, it picks up an apricot accent on the medium finish. Try with Thai food. Drink now."
Riesling,"The terraced vineyard of Ried Bruck is a dominant site in Spitz, stony and impossibly steep. The excellent exposure gives richness to the wine, even in cooler years such as 2007. There is fine balance here, a ripe, perfumed character, with its aromas of wild flowers and thyme and its flavors of green pears and red apples."
Riesling,"An aromatic wine with great depth, this is complex and concentrated. It brings out a great tangy, zesty, steely character that has freshness as well as richness in equal measure. White fruits and red currants leave a crisp, taut aftertaste."
Riesling,"Delicate and sheen, this briskly structured kabinett balances zesty lemon-lime flavors with subtle kisses of white peach and yellow-cherry flavors. Its invigorating mineral finish makes it an irresistible thirst quencher. Enjoy now through 2021."
Riesling,"The nose is reminiscent of the yellow and aromatic peel of ripe apples. It even has a touch of mirabelle. The palate continues in the same fruit-driven vein with that pure, ripe but tart apple note that seems to be such a feature of Alsace Riesling. The palate is dry and has a fine-boned structure that almost crunches in the mouth. A pure lemon note makes for a very clean-cut finish."
Riesling,"With apricot and citrus flavors, this Riesling tastes off-dry, with a honeyed sweetness. It's a little green around the edges, which detracts from the pleasure."
Riesling,"Incredibly pure notes of freshly cut Cox's Orange Pippin assail the nose. The palate has the same purity and a linear, taut, rich but toned body that is yet to reveal all of its secrets. The purity and luminoisty of the fruit is astonishing. We have not seen the best of this yet. For now the purest apple fruit delights. This is deliciously concentrated and very youthful. Drink 2016–2030."
Riesling,"Layers of smoke, spice and lanolin cast a shadowy tone to summery peach and tangerine flavors on this semi-sweet Riesling. Nuances of mineral, spice and fruit build in intensity on the palate, augmented by brisk lemony acidity. Finishes long with a delicate lace of sweetness."
Riesling,"This stunner of a dry Riesling invigorates from first whiff with its zesty tangerine-peel perfume. On the palate, silken layers of white grapefruit and lime fill are amplified by a steely backbone of acidity and minerality. It's a gorgeously composed wine with a persistent, intently mineral finish. Drink now through at least 2030."
Riesling,"This wine boasts a lovely nose redolent of dried apricots and bergamot, with fresh, mossy hints on the background. On the palate, it's medium bodied, not overly sweet or concentrated but with clean melon and citrus flavors that finish clean and fresh."
Riesling,"Produced entirely from vines planted in 1978, this drinks drier than its 13 g/L of residual sugar would indicate. It's juicy and loaded with apple, pear and tangerine fruit. A tangy taste of orange baby aspirin lingers on the finish."
Riesling,"Softly ripe notes of pear mingle with earthier elements on nose and palate of this dryish Riesling. The spine of acidity provides structure and fills the palate with lemony, bright freshness that lingers pleasantly."
Riesling,"Medium-gold in color. Complex and inviting nose layered with a strong earthy minerality, vibrant bright fruit and intriguing notes of petrol and honey. On the palate it is racy, taut and focused full of well defined ripe succulent citrus and stone fruit. Rich, viscous texture perfectly balanced by the wine's crispness and almost steely minerality. Very long, juicy, lingering finish."
Riesling,"The spark of freshly cut lime and lemon is met by riper notions of yellow Mirabelle and Reine Claude plums. There is delicacy and slenderness but above all a bracing clean, sprightly character. Utterly refreshing."
Riesling,The aromas of mandarin orange and apricot seem to show a touch of oxygen exposure. This drinks just off dry with stone-fruit flavors throughout.
Riesling,"While subdued on the nose, crunchy Asian pear and green-apple flavors on the palate are persistent and vital. Racy acidity and delicate sweetness balance neatly. A refreshing, thirst quenching wine with wide appeal."
Riesling,Lime and slate notes make for a very nice opening but lead to a distractingly high level of spritz. The crisp palate is lacking in flavor and finishes on the watery side. Drink up.
Riesling,"Chehalem makes four different Rieslings, and this is often the best of them. Rich and complex, it's dense with grapefruit, lemon, lime, apple and flavors of wet stone. Lovely in the mouth, it lingers gracefully through the finish."
Riesling,"On the sweet side, but it's also crisp, with enough zesty acidity to provide balance. Floral, apple-y and refreshingly light, this is a fine picnic wine. A chalky note gives added depth to the finish."
Riesling,"Intensely aromatic, intensely fruity, this Riesling packs a powerful punch of flavor within a delicate frame. The fruit profile is tropical with concentrated guava and mango flavors spiced with hints of white pepper. It's semi-sweet in style, but bracing acidity leaves the finish quite dry."
Riesling,"Despite its 2.4% residual sugar, this is a tart, lemony wine that seems made to enjoy with raw oysters. The searing acidity is not for everyone, but if you like lip-smacking tartness, this has the depth and flavor to match it."
Riesling,"Sweet and soft, although it does show enough concentrated apple, melon and citrus fruit to warrant recommendation. Finishes with the barest hint of minerality."
Riesling,"Classified as medium dry on the IRF scale, this is a medium-bodied Riesling without much texture, yet classic apple and citrus aromas and flavors. A sensation of wet stone creeps in on the finish."
Riesling,"Touches of candlewax and savory herbs add intrigue and complexity to bright, sunny peach and apricot flavors in this semi-sweet wine. Vivacious and brisk, the palate plays out like a joyful tug-o-war of tangerine acidity and a lingering sweetness that's so refreshingly tasty."
Riesling,"Strikes a welcome note in California white wines with its extreme dryness and crisp, minerally freshness. With tart flavors of citrus, apricot and Asian pear, it's a great restaurant wine."
Riesling,"Dusty mineral tones fade to reveal a glorious perfume of blossoms and grapefruit on this elegant, aromatic Riesling. Semi-dry in style, it's pristine with sun-kissed peach and melon flavors accented by a shower of tangerine acidity. Enjoy now for it's youthful beauty."
Riesling,"Whiffs of smoke and herbs add complexity to this beautifully floral, fruity wine. Off-dry in style, it's richly concentrated with peach and apricot flavors that reverberate on the palate with bracing lime-toned acidity. The long finish has a bristle of lemon-zest astringency."
Riesling,"On the citrusy side of things for the Pfalz, where many of the wines lean toward peachiness. Pineapple and passion fruit notes are accented by hints of stuck flint and a vaguely briny character. Although only 12.5% abv, the wine is richly textured on the palate, then turning crisp and refreshing on the finish."
Riesling,"A blossomy, perfumed edge lends lift and vibe to earthier notes of pressed apple and pear in this light-footed medium-sweet Riesling. It's racy and sharp in mouthfeel with a finish that's brisk and bright."
Riesling,"Mandarin-orange zest, cut Asian pear, lemon blossom and slight beeswax show on the fresh nose of this bottling by young winemaker Mike Callahan. It's extremely dry on the palate, like licking limestone, with hints of nectarine blossom and lemon-skin flavor."
Riesling,"Lip-smacking is an inelegant yet apt word to describe the unctuousness of this nectar of honey, saffron and marmalade. It's delightfully rich and creamy, yet gorgeously balanced, seared by a razor's edge of lemon-lime acidity. It's an exceptional wine now, penetrating and persistent, but will surely delight for decades to come."
Riesling,"From an old clone yielding smaller berries and having a longer hang time, this is even more minerally than Müller's regular Kirchenstück spätlese, showing a briny aspect to the minerality and bringing in more intensity, including passion fruit and a sweetness reminiscent of roasted root vegetables. Ends on lingering notes of honey and lime."
Riesling,"Slightly funky and leesy on the nose, with somewhat sweaty overtones to the citrus and apple aromas. But the flavors are pure, suggesting that the aromatics just need some time to come around—or a quick decanting. It's medium in body, with a crisp, tangy finish that artfully balances sweet and tart."
Riesling,"A sweet trail of orange marmalade percolates through this succulently sweet wine. On the midpalate, savory tones of smoke, nuts and bruised apple add shades of complexity, but the finish is pure and pristine, a shower of lemon and honey that goes on endlessly."
Riesling,"Basically a dessert wine because it jumps beyond the off-dry line into overtly sweet. Shows pastry-filling flavors of apricots and pineapples, with rich vanilla and smoky honey overtones."
Riesling,Lusciously ripe apricots and yellow peaches are electrified by racy streaks of acidity in this dry Riesling. It's light in body yet creamy and expansive on the palate. The finish is long and crisply mineral.
Riesling,"This wine presents an unusual aroma profile with notes of dough and cheese overlaying a base of mineral and lime. The palate is simple and austere with a short finish redolent of peaches. Overall, a bit disappointing for a Grand Cru."
Riesling,"While subdued and closed off at initial tasting, time and aeration seem to bring out this wine's vibrant tangerine and apricot perfume. The spry palate is delicately sweet, juxtaposing fresh, primary stone fruit and lime flavors against a backdrop of savory earth and nut. It's a quiet wine that should gain power and depth with maturity. Hold until 2020."
Riesling,"While the nose gives little away here apart from the slightest lemon flavors, the palate is lightly textured and shows straitlaced lemon freshness with bright rays of zesty fruit. It's an ideal, refreshing apéritif for warm summer days."
Riesling,"This medium-dry spätlese balances savory with sweet. Initially earthy, mineral tones build to plumper peach and pear through the midpalate. It's gossamer in texture, but finishes strong with a polished strike of steel and acid."
Riesling,"Side-by-side, Sheldrake Point's two Riesling ice wines are a fascinating study of how yeast affects flavors in wine. This regular-label ice wine, fermented with inoculated yeast, has a sunny, sweet charm. Notes of pressed apple, warming spice and potpourri perfume lend a cider-like tone. The palate lingers, countering bright, lemony acidity with a long peach kiss."
Riesling,"A rich, amply endowed Clare Riesling, with potent lime aromas accented by touches of petrol, plenty of flavor intensity and a long finish composed of citrus and spice. Hints of baked apple and petrol suggest it may not be the longest-lived Riesling, but it's delicious now and should be good for another five years or so."
Riesling,"This wine starts off well, with a pretty nose and fruit that shows nice ripeness. But once in the mouth all the fruit seems to disappear, and the wine falls flat."
Riesling,"As with all of the Dr. Loosen wines, this blended kabinett is very fruit-forward and direct. The green apple and lime notes are wonderfully pure and balanced. Drink this light, spritely wine over the next few years."
Riesling,"Despite some initially offputting scents of sweaty socks, this is a charming wine. Apple, citrus and petrol mingle easily once the difficult aromas have dissipated to reveal a medium-bodied, off-dry wine. It's creamy-textured in the mouth, then turns crisp and minerally on the finish."
Riesling,"While the aromas of white strawberry, passion fruit preserves and citrus are soft spoken, they increase in intensity on the palate. Relatively low in alcohol, with sweetness and bright acidity, this should pair well with exotic, slightly spicy fare, like curried chicken with mango chutney."
Riesling,"Smoke and pressed apple notes are savory on the nose, but the palate of this zesty off-dry Riesling is fresh with sweet-tart peach and honeydew. It's refreshing and straightforward in style, but finishes with lingering mineral complexities."
Riesling,"Powerful scents mix dried herb, wet grass and petrol—it could be mistaken for Sauvignon Blanc in a blind tasting, and it has that much density and extract. The label says dry, and it is certainly that, much in the Australian style. Big, concentrated, high acid and quite cellarworthy."
Riesling,"Shows wonderful purity of fruit—green apple and lime, perhaps a touch of flower shop greens—and impreccable balance, being light in body, off dry, crisp and refreshing. Delicious."
Riesling,"Struck flint and smoke lend shade to exuberant pineapple, mango and citrus flavors in this sprightly, honey-kissed Auslese. It's an approachable but elegant wine invigorated by whiffs of fresh green herbs and a touch of bitter pollen on the finish. A fantastic bargain find."
Riesling,"Fresh, fragrant and aromatic, this is a clean, clear, limpid wine. Its white fruit flavors are refreshingly crisp, offering delicious acidity. Finishes with a lively citrus aftertaste. Screwcap."
Riesling,"This Riesling is right on the borderline of dry/off-dry (just under 1% RS). The fruit, from cooler Willamette Valley vineyard sites, has been fermented in stainless steel and aged on its lees, yielding a wine that is thick, almost meaty. It's as sappy as a fresh peach, and finishes with crisp peach-skin phenolics. All-in-all this is a surprising wine, neither simple nor plain, but full-flavored in the comforting style that seems almost to have vanished from the Northwest."
Riesling,"Already developed, with hints of toast and marmalade on the nose and showing baked apple and citrus flavors on the palate. This plump, medium-bodied Riesling finishes with a touch of honeyed softness, suggesting it should be consumed over the next year."
Riesling,"A taut, tense fight between the acids and sugars highlight this excellent dessert wine. A strong streak of spicy grain runs straight through the compact citrus and honey fruit flavors. The sweetness is neither cloying nor syrupy—rather, it neatly laces the wine together."
Riesling,"A very subdued nose suggests some dried orange peel but the palate is full of life: there is bracing, bright and lemon-scented acidity on the dry palate and drenched stone. There is concentration and a texture of the finest, purest citrus oil. This is wonderfully mature and ready now but has the stuffing to last. Drink 2016–2020."

Riesling,"This would be a wonderful wine even if it cost a little more. As it is, it's a steal. Shows refined apricot, peach, lychee, mineral and floral flavors, finished with brisk, mouthwatering acidity, and an absolutely dry finish. One of the best Riesling values available in Cailfornia, and a tremendous cocktail wine. Just 600 cases were produced."
Riesling,"From vines trained on the lyre system, here is one of the classics of Austrian wine. Its richness and concentration are present from the first taste. As the wine opens, it brings out perfumes and intense fruit flavors. A great wine that needs long-term aging."
Riesling,"Boundary Breaks has proven to be the break-out producer of the Finger Lakes this year with an excellent line up of wines, and this off-dry wine is amongst its best. Elegantly perfumed with notes of fresh green florals and herbs, it builds in power and expression on the palate with pristine white peach flavors pierced with lime acidity and a reverberating mineral finish."
Riesling,"With layers upon layers of spicy saffron, peach, honey and caramel to be enjoyed on the nose alone, this heady botrytized Riesling is pure hedonism. The sweet-tart palate is deft and spry yet deeply lusciously penetrating in flavor. Spine-tingling acidity darts through a honeyed, waxy slick that extends the finish endlessly. It's already a heart-stopping wine but will continue to improve for decades to come."
Riesling,"Delicate whiffs of orange blossom and honeycomb scent this slightly off-dry Riesling. The palate is ripe with honey and peach, but elegantly balanced with lime acidity and a lingering touch of crushed-stone minerality."
Riesling,"Whiffs of savory herb and smoke fade into buoyant fruit on the palate of this juicy, tangerine-kissed Riesling. Off-dry in style, it's easygoing and fruit forward, with a finish marked by sweet apricot and citrus flavors. Drink now through 2020."
Riesling,"Stunningly good, this hits you with waves of fruit, acidity and spice. It reverberates across, down and through the palate, recalling clover, citrus zest and grapefruit, all underlaid by bracing minerality."
Riesling,"This is a medium-sweet Riesling boasting Spätlese-level alcohol, that mixes soft fruit flavors of apple, peach and pear with hints of honey and tea. Give it a light chill before sipping."
Riesling,"Pretty floral aromas accent notes of fennel and savory apple on this dry, crisp Riesling. Bright and bold on the palate, this has lemony acidity and an abundance of fresh apple flavor."
Riesling,"A heavy dose of petrol is the aromatic greeting, and it comes with hints of rubber, latex and waxy white fruits. Feels tangy and fresh due to blazing acidity, while it tastes both of tropical fruits and diesel. Long and chiseled on the finish."
Riesling,"This contends for the best $10 Riesling in the country. It's off dry, with 30g/L of residual sugar, but not too sweet for some Asian noodle entrées. The mouthfeel is thick and borders on syrupy, with penetrating flavors of mango, papaya and peaches. It could also be served after dinner with fruit and soft cheeses."
Riesling,"The wine is crisp, lightly fruity with good acidity and a bright, tight texture. Apple and lime juice fruit flavors give a fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2015."
Riesling,"An interesting example of dry Riesling, one that displays a dense, honeyed bouquet and flavors that resemble honey but without the sweetness. Hard to imagine, but that's the closest approximation I can come up with. It's creamy on the midpalate and fairly full bodied (12.5% abv) for a wine from this far north."
Riesling,"A mild whiff of gasoline is typical for Riesling, while this also smells a touch cheesy but not funky. A straight-ahead lemony palate delivers short blasts of lemon and underripe nectarine flavors, while the finish is mostly fresh and focused."
Riesling,"A complex array of floral tones builds throughout this medium-sweet Riesling. Green notes of iris and lily add refreshment to a backdrop of heady jasmine and orange blossom. The palate is intensely fruity with juicy white peach and apricot flavors accented with a zesty lime acidity that revitalizes. Delicately framed, yet decadent and ebullient."
Riesling,"A subdued nose has just slight hints of citrus and apple. The palate adds some richer notes of Golden Delicious, tempered with lemon freshness. The body is streamlined, light and dry and has a very refreshing lemony finish."

Riesling,"Clean and fresh, this juicy wine carries a bit of fruit sweetness, but the flavors are tilted toward minerality rather than fruitiness. It's wonderfully refreshing, with a mix of citrus rind, melon and white peach working into an extended, palate-cleansing finish."
Riesling,"Dusty mineral and pollen notes lend savory complexity to this bracing, taut wine full of lemon and lime flavors. It's austere in style, yet attractive for it's earthy nuances. The finish meanders with cool, steely polish."

Riesling,"A hint of lemon balm lends a fresh, herbaceous character to concentrated pineapple, honey and preserved peach flavors. It's sweet with fruit, but balanced with bright citrus acidity and a sprightly mouthfeel."
Riesling,"Aromas of honey-glazed tangerines, lemons and limes abound on this spry, light-footed Riesling, but there's a savory element of nuts and smoke that persists from nose to finish as well. The palate is moderately sweet yet balanced keenly with acidity. The finish is brisk and clean."
Riesling,"Lovely notes of crisp apples make for a very friendly nose. The palate comes in with immense freshness that is nonetheless tempered by a balm-like rounded texture that couches Riesling's freshness in seamless fluidity. The palate remains dry and is colored with red and green apple, lemon and tangerine. The finish is dry and wonderfully lip smacking."
Riesling,"Richly aromatic, with notes of orange marmalade, apricot, honey and crème fraîche. It's thick and creamy in feel while still displaying exceptional balance, length and intensity."
Riesling,"Hints of crushed wet stone and granite penetrate through the honeyed peach and flower notes on this intensely minerally Riesling. Dry and lavishly textured, with peppery green notes of herb and fennel, it has a medium-long finish."
Riesling,"Deeply savory tones of bramble and earth are juxtaposed against fresh tangerine and lemon in this light-footed, semidry Riesling. It's not a deeply complex wine but sprightly and crisp, with a clean, slightly honeyed finish. Drink now."
Riesling,"Smoky and savory with a touch of spring ramps and moss, this medium-sweet Riesling balances ripe, luscious peach and nectarine flavors with a gradation of green, herbal accents. It's delicately framed with a steely, honed acidity that lingers on the finish."
Riesling,"Starts off tighter and less giving than the regular Mort's Block, only gradually displaying its greater potential longevity. Offers crushed stone and lime notes, medium body and a clean green apple and citrus finish right now, but expect it to develop petrol, honey and toast notes within the next several years; drink now–2017."
Riesling,"Faint notes of ripe pear rise from the glass. The palate comes in with fresh zestiness—it is dry and slender but has lip-smacking citrus freshness of grapefruit and tangerine. This is bundled, full of invigorating appetizing freshness. There is something bracingly clean but also harmonious about the finish."
Riesling,"Sweet-tart tangerine and quince are shaded in deep folds of smoke, crushed slate and pollen in this nuanced wine. Savory spice and earth tones are prominent now, but a core of pristine honey and citrus notes pulse from within. Concentrated and composed with radiant lemon-lime acidity, it's likely to improve with bottle age. Hold till at least 2020."
Riesling,"The nose gives little away but the palate reveals a juicy, straightlaced, citrus core of great freshness. As bracing as a palate cleanser and as refreshing as ocean spray. Needless to say this is ultraclean."
Riesling,"Exotic pineapple, lime and tangerine scents combine with notes of slate and wet stone on this lovely Riesling. It's quite dry, but feels lush on the palate with a sweet grapefruit softness. Finishes long and minerally."
Riesling,"Smoke, orange, wet stone and earth notes are powerful and beguiling on the nose. The palate has absolute concentration and energy and more of that smoky promise. This is like the bundled focus of a laser light—incisive, precise and piercing. Notions of peach, lemon and tangerine dance and hover, but the central core and force remains a kind of drive that could move mountains. This is a sleeping giant, absolute and pure, brooding, laying in wait to unleash its might. The palate is absolutely dry, absolutely fresh, absolutely uncompromising. The finish is piercingly clean. Wait for this. Drink 2025–2040 at least."
Riesling,"Atypically ripe, weighty and intense for a Finger Lakes wine, with pear and peach notes buttressed by minerally dry extract. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous and the alcohol level a relatively high 13.1%, but it finishes long and elegantly, with tongue-tingling acids."
Riesling,"Made without oak, this Riesling is slightly sweet with sugary orange and peach flavors. It lacks the acidity to balance the sweetness, which makes the finish cloying."
Riesling,"The Gunderloch wines are among the best from Rheinhessen, even their non-site-specific wines like the Diva spätlese. Aromas of bergamot, pear and fresh greens give way to ripe pineapple, citrus and herb flavors. It's fresh and zippy, offering a lot of refreshment value in an off-dry style."
Riesling,"Stony mineral notes accent fragrant blossom and grapefruit notes on this dry, elegant Riesling. The palate is lean and steely, with a distinct line of struck steel and lime, but it's also buoyantly fruity with notes of luscious white peach and honey. A dramatic wine with a long, lingering mineral finish."
Riesling,"A lovely touch of flint and smoke carry a touch of residual reduction. Underneath that is lemony purity. The palate adds a touch of stone fruit, a touch of ripe mirabelle plum—its generosity only underlined by the taut lemon freshness that pervades the wine. There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish. This is lip smacking but has not even started to show itself properly. The finish is clean, stony and lasting. This is one to keep. Drink 2020–2040."
Riesling,"The aromas of ripe peach, honeysuckle and jasmine are bright. It's medium sweet and finishes with a floral soap flourish. It needs more acid to stand it up but goes down easy."
Riesling,"Notes of bruised apple peel make this wine appear older than it is, but it is not without charm. The apple fruit is tied into a streak of bright, lemony freshness concluding in a just off-dry, invigorating finish."
Riesling,"A full, oily nose with aromas of orange blossom and lychee turns more fleshy and mealy with airing. This has a plump, flush body and flavors of lime, orange and white table grapes. A citrusy finish is fruity but doesn't glide."
Riesling,"Shades of smoke, dried herbs and nut skins add savory tones to this dry Riesling. The palate builds intensity on the midpalate with layers of fresh apple, lime skin and underripe stone fruit, bolstered by sprightly tangerine-laced acidity."
Riesling,"Baking soda, ripe citrus pith, lime blossoms and a soft petrol touch show on the nose of this wine from a vineyard to watch in southern San Luis Obispo County. Tons of sprinkling acidity shows once sipped, with the nervy palate offering orange oil, lemon pith and peel, chamomile, goldenseal root and sunflower-seed flavors."
Riesling,"Punchy and forward, this fruity concoction offers loads of ripe pineapple, peach and citrus flavors. It's slightly off dry and straightforward in style but neatly balanced. Sharp lemon-lime acidity lends a pleasantly zesty kick to the finish."

Riesling,Delicate sweetness and lip-smacking juiciness come together in this off-dry Riesling. It's zesty and light-footed but chock full of peach and grapefruit nectar glazed with caramelized sugar. Drink now through 2018 to maximize its youthful energy.
Riesling,"This plump, creamy-textured Riesling shows plenty of flattering peach and lime fruit, but also enough mint and slate that it avoids being simply fruity. Balanced toward the dry side of the Riesling spectrum, so it should prove versatile at the table."
Riesling,"Hints of honey, citrus and petrol mark the aromas of this wine from a legendary Eden Valley estate. It's a medium-bodied rendition of Riesling, dry and petrolly, with a long, concentrated finish that suggests that this wine could safely be cellared for up to 10 years."
Riesling,"Layers of pollen, dusty mineral and spice lend complexity to this concentrated wine full of yellow peach and fresh apple flavors. It's delicate and lithe in texture, yet punchy and penetrating."
Riesling,"Whiffs of smoke and crushed stone form a veil over concentrated peach and preserved quince in this remarkably nuanced auslese. It's sweet and juicy on the palate and accented with hints of fresh herb. Earthy flavors lend a dark, savory dimension."
Riesling,"A pale, lemon color Riesling. The complex nose of honey, delicate stone fruit, elder-flower and stony minerality is deliciously inviting, while intense, focused ripe fruit prevails all across the palate. This is sweet, yet crisp and oozing freshness, with a taut, lively texture. Very long, complex and subtle at the same time."
Riesling,There is a wonderful tang of orange zest in this fresh and fruit wine. With its attractive perfumes and flavors of currants it is ready to drink now but could age for a few years. Screwcap.
Riesling,"This has intriguing aromas of marzipan and white cherry, plus touches of apple and mineral. A medium-bodied wine, it offers acidity that becomes mouth-puckering on the finish. Pair this with some goat cheese to help tame the tartness."
Riesling,"The Ehrhart style is for rich wines and this impressive Grand Cru is no exception. It has intense flavors of white fruits, lemon, spice and a hint of thyme. Its acidity balances that richness, cutting a path that gives a great lift and leaves the wine fresh at the end. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,"What a surprise to find that this Riesling is bone dry. It boasts complex flavors of mineral, lime, Meyer lemon and orange zest, with fantastic acidity that awakens the palate and prepares it for food."
Riesling,"Ripe yellow peaches, golden honey and billowing florals perfume this outstanding Riesling. Dry on the palate with a touch of stonefruit sweetness, it's an impeccably complex wine with a shower of slate and stone in the midpalate and delicious lime pith astringency throughout."
Riesling,"Luminous peach and tangerine flavors take center stage in this gorgeously composed sweet Riesling. Lip-smacking honey and candied orange peel flavors are offset by a dazzling streak of citrusy acidity. Despite all the sweetness, the finish is pristinely mineral. It's stunning already but should only improve through 2050."
Riesling,"Rich without being overly sweet, this wine's aromas are redolent of dried apricots, with a hint of shiitake mushroom as well. Gingery spice balances the honeyed richness on the palate, and extends through the long finish."
Riesling,"Glimpses of savory earth and pressed apple on the nose turn brighter and fresher on the palate of this exceptionally light, honey-kissed Riesling. It's an interesting wine that calibrates dark and light elements deftly. Bristling notes of lemon juice and pith lead a long pleasantly astringent finish."
Riesling,"Gentle, aromatic notes of ripe apricot appear first, followed by a little smoke. The palate comes in like a clarion call of lemony, brisk, citric freshness. This wine is streamlined and crystal clear, with a defined outline and a stony, concentrated core. With all its power it is muscular but suave and ultraclean."

Hints of wet stone and lime-like acidity lend a crisp, tonic tone to the midpalate, extending onto the long, lingering finish."
Riesling,"Fresh citrus has a tang of green apple on the nose. The palate colors this with an equally zesty dollop of grapefruit, but something riper, richer, almost of dried fruit, also swings in there. This is intriguing and fresh, zesty and taut, lip-smacking and moreish. I feel that this will give up its secrets with a little more bottle age, but it already is delicious now."
Riesling,"A riper touch of russet-pear peel joins the fresh lemon notes on the nose. On the palate, zesty concentration becomes evident. This is compact and has impact but retains a juicy, friendly core that makes you want to sip more. Lemon ripeness continues through the long, dry finish."
Riesling,"Blossomy and fresh, this off-dry, light-footed Riesling offers a palate full of sweet-tart white-grapefruit flavor. Zesty and spry, it's a refreshing apéritif best enjoyed young."
Riesling,"Tart lime and gooseberry aromas turn plush and plump on the palate of this lip-smackingly ripe spätlese. Apricot and yellow peach flavors penetrate deeply, catapulted by shards of lemon-lime acidity. It's breathlessly light in body, yet lingers long, leaving airy kisses of blossom and fresh herb in its wake. Irresistible already but should improve through 2025."
Riesling,"There should more interest from consumers for well-put-together Rieslings like this. It's dryish, low in alcohol, acidic and minerally, with effusive citrus, peach, white-flower and honey flavors that require some thought to fully appreciate. With only 12.5% alcohol by volume, it has a complex delicacy."
Riesling,"Although slightly off dry, it retains excellent tension and minerality. Pear, peach and pineapple fruit flavors combine in an elegant and long-lasting wine."

Riesling,"Consistently one of Washington's most expressive Rieslings, with intensely floral aromatics—notably clover—that is carried into the mouth, along with honey, tea, lime, candied pineapple and cantaloupe. The effect is riveting; the flavors cascade around each other, balancing the 20g/L residual sugar with vivid acidity."
Riesling,"Among all eight of the winery's current Rieslings, this was the least accessible upon opening. With ample breathing time it began to show more aromatics, with flavors of orange and pear in a nicely concentrated, well-balanced package. This is the one to decant!"
Riesling,"Very pure notes of freshly cut, tart but ripe apples fill the nose, but there is also a slight perfume of fir forest and lemon zest. The palate is ripe and shows a dry but nonetheless lusciously ripe core, all straightened and brightened by fresh, lemony acidity. This has both balance and drama and is a joy to drink."
Riesling,"Lovely aromatics conjure up rose petals, a dash of body powder and ripe citrus. The fruit is very ripe, with almost a candy character, and there's a sensation of powdered sugar. But despite the almost 14g/L residual sugar, it's more sweet/tart than syrupy, keeping it sappy and refreshing."
Riesling,"A crush of mineral notes on the nose lend earthy dimension to this buoyantly ripe, fruity auslese. Layers of sweet mango, pineapple and guava abound on the palate, off set by a spine tingling spray of lime. It's decadent yet balanced, with a long, irresistibly clingy finish. Ready to drink now but it will shine for decades to come."
Riesling,"Sweet and slightly viscous in texture, this wine lacks some aromatic flourishes, sacrificing complexity for purity of its pineapple, apple and citrus flavors. Yet because of its balanced, crisp acidity, the wine still sings, finishing long and mouthwatering. Drink now–2030."

Riesling,"Thick, oily and sweet, this wine is clearly not a typical spätlese. Dried apricots, baked apple and dried spices coat the palate, finishing long and sweet but with just enough lime-like acidity for balance. Drink now–2020. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC."

Riesling,"A lovely effort from proprietor Raimund Prüm, this plump, creamy-textured spätlese displays ample minerality—there's a distinctly slate-driven note—allied to ripe apple, stone fruit and citrus. Sweet but not overwhelmingly so, this would be terrific with slightly sweet or spicy dishes."

Riesling,"Minerality takes center stage in this light-footed but penetrating dry Riesling. While the fruit profile is zesty and green—suggesting tart, under-ripe lime, tangerines and melon rinds—the palate is gilded by slick layers of candlewax and petrol, lending a dense, voluminous mouthfeel. It's an elegant, stately wine to drink now through 2023."
Riesling,"The smoky, minerally aspects of the site show through even a thick veil of botrytis. This is intensely honeyed, filled with dried apricot and candied pineapple flavors, yet not without nuance. Incredibly sweet, but as balanced as a wine this unctuous can be, with a long, mouthwatering finish."
Riesling,Smoke and mineral tones lend a savoriness to flavors of pressed apples and pears on this slightly rustic Riesling. The palate is sweet and sunny with brisk apple cider flavor touched with dried sage and spice.
Riesling,"Super-tight and not yet willing to charm, this presently gives little more than the heady spritz of ripe lemon peel, but the stony background, concentration on the palate and a haunting, zesty length all point to future reward. Be patient with this and it will repay you thousandfold, with honeyed richness, luscious peach and a strong mineral backbone. Drink from 2018."

Showing flavors of Meyer lemons and limes, yellow apricots, peaches, wildflowers and slate, it finishes with a long, fine taste of honey."

Riesling,"Primary yet deeply complex, this powerful Auslese juxtaposes intense mineral complexities against a bounty of luscious white grapefruit, yellow plum and lemon flavors. Though it feels so lithe in texture, it builds in fruit and smoky mineral tones, catapulted by a brisk line of acidity. It drinks beautifully now, but should deepen through 2025 and hold even longer."
Riesling,"A sweet-smelling wine with notes of overripe pear, pineapple and jasmine. It also drinks quite sweet (26g/L residual sugar) but doesn't have the acid or flavor concentration to match."

Riesling,"Bright, friendly and pure mandarin flavors make for a very appetizing, fruit-forward wine. The same friendly, sunny mandarin fruit fills the palate with its tension between citrus tartness and luscious sweet freshness.

Riesling,"Subtle but luscious notes of Mirabelle plum, ripe greengage and peach lend a seductive touch to this taut, structured and beautifully textured wine whose palate is reminiscent of bot fresh apple peel and grapefruit zest.

An impeccably balanced wine that's fully approachable now, but structured enough to withstand at least another decade."
Riesling,"Dusty saffron and pollen notes lend earthiness to this otherwise ripe, fruity Riesling. Yellow peach and apricot flavors are plump and pert, accented by sunny tangerine sweetness. The finish is brisk but clean. Drink now."
Riesling,"Old vines dating back to 1904 produce this unusually brawny late-harvest wine. It's deeply fruity, almost tropical in profile, bursting with sun-kissed mango and guava flavors. High-toned tangerine and grapefruit acidity lend balance, highlighting a delicately astringent, tea-toned finish. Drink now through 2025."
Riesling,"As the wine ages, it shows a soft, toasty and nutty side that adds complexity to the tight fruitiness that remains. It's a wine in transition, still fresh while adding some concentration, broadening the steely texture and giving hints of the serious wine it will be. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,"An intensely fruity wine with refreshing swathes of bright white fruits, this is fragrant and textured with lively acidity cutting through the creaminess. Very pure tasting with great depths. Age for 3–4 years. Screwcap."
Riesling,"Pale gold in color. Dominant resiny aromas. Slightly funky with notes of honey, earthy mushroom and ripe stone fruit. Broad on the palate with similar earthy flavors prevailing, warm  with some spice and creaminess. Fairly rich texture, but lacking freshness and a shortish finish."
Riesling,"Plump and aromatically subdued with a touch of residual sweetness (halbtrocken), this shows some midpalate concentration and provides some citrusy refreshment."
Riesling,"Crisp apple and pear aromas take a richer, riper turn towards melon and peach on the palate of this medium-sweet Riesling. Its juicy, fruity demeanor is straightforward and lush, but a punchy strike of lemon-lime acidity livens up the finish. Drink now."

Riesling,"Subtle yellow peach and mineral tones on the nose intensify on the palate of this surprisingly tropical kabinett.

It's delightful now, but should keep drinking well through 2025."

Riesling,"A straight-ahead Riesling, pleasant but uncomplicated. Minerals envelop white stone fruit on the palate; the fruit is more fruit skin than flesh. Nose is light and feminine, with citrus and confectioners' sugar notes."
Riesling,"Aromatic and complex, this wine, though not quite bone dry, is tart and citrusy. The mixed fruit flavors run a spectrum from grapefruit to lemon candy to nectarine, lingering gracefully into a mineral-soaked finish."
Riesling,"Starts off with aromas of apple blossoms and ultraripe pears. The pear notes carry through on the palate, where they're joined by a touch of anise. This slightly sweet bottling pales in comparison to Paumanok's Dry Riesling, but offers a well-made, soft alternative."

Riesling,"Puckering lime zest and lemon notes are softened by crisp yellow peach and nectarine in this dry, light-bodied Riesling. Racy and brisk, it finishes with an elegant crush of minerals. Drink now."
Riesling,"For now, funky yeast dominates the nose. The palate, however, abounds with friendly yellow Mirabelle plum and mandarin notes, all pulled into beautiful focus by lemon freshness.

Riesling,"This is a very nice Riesling for drinking with today's ethnic fare. Although it's softer than you'd expect from this normally tart varietal, it's clean and spicy, with citrus, flower and honey flavors. The sweetness level is off-dry."
Riesling,"The 2014 vintage produced so many standouts for St. Urbans-Hof, it's hard to decide on favorites, but this luminous Spätlese pulls quite a bit of weight for its dimunitive price tag. While delicate in frame, it's dramatic in composure, shifting from floral fruity exuberance to waxy, mineral and taut in each sip. It's drinking gorgeously now but should hold well, and perhaps improve, through at least 2020."
Riesling,"Saffron and orange rind lend spicy zest to honey and floral tones on this gorgeously rich auslese. It's luscious, with sweet yellow peach and caramel flavors, but struck with a clean line of tangerine acidity. Bold and powerful in concentration, it finishes with just a hint of tea-leaf astringency."
Riesling,"Fragrant citrus zest sets the tone: lemon and grapefruit govern nose and delicious, refreshing and zippy palate. Exquisite freshness and very ripe lemon make for streamlined lightness that leaves a very mineral and long impression. Riper fruit, like Mirabelle plum, hides underneath and is poised to come to the fore any moment."
Riesling,"This aromatic, fruity wine has a crisp and steely backbone. It's laced with citrus and crisp pear flavors, fresh and with a bright, clean aftertaste. Drink now."
Riesling,"Although it has a delicate structure, that feels almost lace-like on the palate, this light-bodied Riesling bursts with concentrated ripe peach and apricot flavors. Semisweet in style, this has vibrant acidity and an oyster-shell- and stone-like minerality that lingers on the long finish."
Riesling,"Off-dry, with initial flavors of orange candy and a slight medicinal graininess. It develops some honeyed lemon in the midpalate, and smoothes into a pleasant-drinking, low alcohol and high acid Riesling."

Riesling,This is a rich and complex wine that shows spiced pear and a tense structure. It is very aromatic and fresh while also rich and concentrated. A powerful statement of the fruit and minerality of the Wachau and definitely for long-term aging. Don't drink before 2016.

Riesling,"Dusty mineral and herb tones lend complexity to the plush, sunny peach and apricot in this bristling semidry Riesling. It's juicy and plump yet revitalizing and fresh, marked by tangerine acidity and a lacy fringe of sugar that lingers on the finish. Drink now through 2025."
Riesling,"A subdued nose gives glints of earthy smoke and citrus zest. It is on the palate that soaring notes of ripe Amalfi lemon tangerines appear. This is ripeness expressed within a taut firm frame of acidic bright structure. The palate is concentrated and linear, the finish is dry and lasting. The citrus aromas gain something of apple towards the finish. Wonderfully fresh. Lovely now but sure to develop. Drink 2017–2035."
Riesling,"Medium sweet (listed at 24g/L residual sugar), this includes 7% Gewürztraminer in the blend. Lime and lime skin are the first sniff responders, with more citrus and wet stone flavors following. Despite the sugar, it's a rather tart tasting wine, suitable for a wide variety of spicy Asian fare."
Riesling,"This off-dry Riesling's honey-kissed peach and nectarine flavors are lip-smackingly sweet. Its light, sprightly texture and high-toned acidity lend balance and refreshment. Brisk and easy-drinking, it offers loads of quaffable appeal."
Riesling,"More delicate in character than the Kiedrich Turmberg, this gossamer-light auslese balances slick honey, peach and yellow-cherry flavors against a backdrop of crystalline minerality. Nerve-racing acidity extends a long luscious finish."
Riesling,"Fragrant ripe apricot, edged with notions of citrus foliage streams from the glass. The same intriguing flavor combo of ripeness and freshness, aroma and full fruit, makes up the precise and clean palate. The finish is lip-smacking and still veers and shimmers between full-on fruit ripeness and tart zesty citrus."

Riesling,"A rich layer of caramelized honey penetrates through bristling limes, lemons and tangerines in this sprightly medium-sweet Riesling. It's light as a feather yet pulsating with sweet yellow peach and apricot flavors. Vibrantly acidic but nuanced and substantial, it drinks gorgeously now but has enough substance to age well through at least 2025."
Riesling,"While demure on the nose, this dry, seemingly diminutive Riesling builds in power and concentration on the palate. It's fairly low in alcohol, with an unassuming gradation of flavors ranging from lime to lemon and grapefruit, but its rippling textural expanse lends persistence and gravitas."
Riesling,"Delicate lavender and herb notes perfume this pretty off-dry wine. It's delicate in profile, but flavors of tart yellow stone fruit and blossom gain intensity on the palate with a streak of lemon-lime acidity. It concludes with a refreshing mineral tone."
Riesling,"The sweetest and ripest of Felton Road's 2002 Rieslings, the Block 1 boasts 5-6% residual sugar balanced by a long, citrusy finish. Aromas of green ferns, limes and powdered sandstone provide a pretty counterpoint to the powerful flavors of ripe peaches and pears."
Riesling,"Restrained Meyer lemon and slender zestiness characterize this featherlight wine that nonetheless has a concentrated, melting core and convinces with simple purity."
Riesling,"Bright, crisp and fresh, as a 2009 Clare Riesling should be, this is a pretty wine, blooming on the nose with floral notes, apples and citrus fruit. The lime and green apple flavors are zesty on the finish, but not that long or intense. Probably best from now–2014, but could develop interesting nuances beyond that."
Riesling,"The crispness is paramount here, maybe too much, meaning that the wine is very green. Of course, this is Riesling and is way too young now. For the moment, the fruit is taut and strung out, and it certainly needs 2–3 years."
Riesling,"What to remark on first: those hints of mellow, luscious ripeness of plum, peach and apple, or that zesty, breezy lemon acidity? Together they make a complete and contrasting picture that focuses on full fruit expression and slender but concentrated linearity."
Riesling,"Ribbon Ridge is making a name for itself as a premier AVA for Oregon Riesling.

Riesling,"Delicate hints of crushed mineral and white flower linger in this dry appley Riesling. Soft acidity lends a slightly broad, flat feel to the palate but the finish is clean and crisp."
Riesling,This wine balances ripeness with crispness. There is a spice note as well as a smooth texture that will round out further as the wine develops over the next four years..
Riesling,"One quarter of this Riesling was aged in neutral barrels, the rest in stainless steel, finishing at just 10 g/L of residual sugar to yield a round, racy palate of fresh herb, apple and melon flavors. A subtle note of butter and spice emerges as the finish winds down."
Riesling,"Ripe apple fruit is tempered by citrus freshness tinged with herbal spice suggesting sage and fennel seed. In the end, citric purity wins and carries this streamlined, concentrated wine into a long, spicy finish."
Riesling,"The scent of lemon and orange flesh is contained by lovely zestiness on the nose. The palate is no different and holds ripe juicy stone fruit with exquisitely drawn tangy zestiness. This is concentrated and refreshing, energetic, serious and lively. Its lemony verve characterizes everything from the first whiff to the lasting finish. This is racy and delicious now but will drink well from 2019 through 2035."
Riesling,"Lush strokes of honey and caramel intensify ripe peach and melon flavors in this fruity but light-footed wine. It's luscious, delicately sweet and calibrated with electric acidity and lime pith astringency on the finish. Irresistibly forward yet featherlight in demeanor."

Its green apple, grapefruit and peach hints are accented with light floral, spicy touches. Vibrant acidity keeps it lively and appetizing with each sip."
Riesling,"More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018–2034."
Riesling,"Sunny, peachy sweetness abounds in this light-footed Riesling. Off dry in style, it's breathlessly fresh and fruity, yet intensified by shimmering lime and mineral tones. Drink now for its youthful effervescence."
Riesling,"Burly in shape, with broad shoulders, ample alcohol and densely packed mineral flavors. Flashes of honey and gingery spice lighten the scene somewhat, but this slightly oily Riesling is darker and more brooding than most. The lingering finish is nearly dry."
Riesling,"Spine-tingling acidity is offset by pristine white peach and pear notes in this intensely mineral dry Riesling. An homage to Eugenia Frank, wife of Dr. Konstantin Frank, it's seemingly delicate in stature yet persistent and penetrating, finishing with cool, steely focus."
Riesling,"Bold in alcohol, with a dry, intensely textured palate, this Riesling is rich and ripe, with notes of honeysuckle, peach and even a hint of berry. It carries its girth well, with a zippy streak of lemon acidity that cuts through all the ripeness, leading to a long, subtly mineral finish."
Riesling,"Slightly earthy, savory tones of lanolin and herb lend complexity to a palate that's lavish with peach and quince jelly flavors. Semi-sweet in style, it's quaffable and refreshing with its fruity exuberance offset by a cutting, stark acidity."

Riesling,"A touch of lemon zest, a hint of lime, a suspicion of yeast: the nose of this wine is fresh and restrained. Light but juicy, the body ripples with refreshing ease across the tongue. It's a slender, pure and uplifting wine with zestiness and enduring, almost-weightless freshness."
Riesling,"Savory hints of moss and lime, of fragrant, crushed citrus foliage and very pure lemon zest make for a totally seductive nose. How this can have all the fragrant promise of the coast when it is from landlocked Austria is anyone's guess. The palate is concentrated, streamlined and presents a panoply of zesty citrus notes: mandarin and lemon peel one moment, lime and grapefruit the next. Totally charming in its youth, this really is made for the long run. Drink 2016–2030 at least."
Riesling,"Whiffs of saffron and spice lend earthen complexity to cutting lime and green plum in this zesty Riesling. Off dry on the palate, it's delicately sheer and spry. Its invigorating style is pleasurable already, but should only meld and improve from now through 2022."
Riesling,"Sugar cookies dusted with saffron and blossom notes perfume this dancing, delicate sweet Riesling. It's so subtle and brisk on the palate, but wispy lines of stone fruit, pollen and honey build dramatically through a long, lingering finish."
Riesling,"Made from a blend of grapes from the estate's top vineyards, this vivacious dry Riesling balances crisp mineral tones against ripe, tropical notes of mango, pineapple and melon. It's lusciously mouthcoating yet cut with strikes of tangerine and lime. Delightful now, but structured enough to improve through at least 2023."
Riesling,"Pleasantly bitter hints of orange peel mingle with notes of ripe pear on the nose. The juicy palate adds tart orange and zesty grapefruit to this incisive, aromatic and very moreish mix. The palate is precise and lip-smacking, fresh and concentrated. The full refreshing impact becomes clear on the long finish."

Riesling,"Honey-kissed peaches waft from this ripe, rich off-dry Riesling full of juicy, luscious stone fruit and citrus. It's quaffable and thirst quenching, yet refreshingly brisk with a lingering shower of lemon-lime acidity."
Riesling,"A dry wine, companion to the winery's off-dry estate bottling. This does not give up its fruit as some dry Rieslings do; there is a pleasing mix of lemon, grapefruit, pineapple and apricot, full in the mid-palate, then turning more astringent and cheerily tart in the finish. This is very young, compact, and still tight as a drum; it could be cellared for up to a decade."
Riesling,"While aromatically subdued, this semidry, late-harvest Riesling is surprisingly exuberant on the palate. Sunny and bright grapefruit and apricot flavors coat the tongue in rich, almost creamy, layers, lingering through a bracing lemon-lime finish."
Riesling,"Freshly cut apple peel and apple fruit create a very welcoming and lively palate. The fruit is clean and very invigorating, while the dry finish provides cool refreshment."
Riesling,"Juicy streaks of grapefruit and pineapple in this spry, dry Riesling are cut by laser-focused acidity and rocky edges of slate. It's approachable and fresh yet abundantly elegant. Drink now through 2018."
Riesling,"The merest touch of lemon appears on the nose. The palate is equally reticent, only gradually revealing a touch of orange blossom and apple peel around a very lemony, bright, linear core. This has concentration but no heaviness, there is depth and toned muscle. The finish is dry and alluring, focusing on that lemon purity with a lovely earthy edge of apple peel. Drink 2019–2030."
Riesling,"Sweet and lush in the house style, but lighter on its feet than many of the other bottlings from Dr. Pauly-Bergweiler, this kabinett shows some intriguing fumé-like notes on the nose, then delivers ripe melon and pear fruit on the palate. Finishes long."

Crisp and light, it's balanced and ideal for after-dinner cheeses or poached pears."
Riesling,"A wonderfully light-footed Riesling that has an energetic, lively core fizzing with lemon freshness and verve. There is a very light touch here, but despite all this filigree structure there is depth and a profound sense of pure citrus flavor. This really gets under your skin with its very own, tiptoeing, featherlight way. The pure lemons last and last."
Riesling,"Notes of turmeric and fennel lend spice to fresh apple and pear in this expressive wine. It's off dry in style with a refreshing, delicate mouthfeel."
Riesling,"Waipara is becoming better known for its Rieslings, thanks to wines like this one. Bold pineapple and kumquat aromas and flavors come across as broad and off-dry without being flabby or fat, then end with a flourish of baking spices and a hint of cracked pepper. Drink now–2015."
Riesling,"Intensely perfumed with notes of violet petals, potpourri and herbs, this is a stunning, elegant Riesling that's also powerfully structured on the palate. It's intensely ripe with stonefruit, but quite dry in style with reverberating lime-juice acidity and a deliciously astringent lime-pith note on the finish."
Riesling,Pressed apple and dusty mineral notes scent the nose of this subdued slightly savory Riesling. Juicy tangerine and Meyer lemon flavors lend sweetness to the midpalate. The moderately long finish is accented by dustings of pollen and saffron.
Riesling,"While the nose seems a bit savory, with muted apple and honeycomb notes, this dry, full-bodied Riesling is quite fruity on the palate, with pleasant peach and nectarine flavors. It's brisk, with lemon-lime acidity and just a hint of astringency on the finish."
Riesling,"Lean and steely, with penetrating minerality, this bone-dry Riesling just begs to be paired with briny oysters or caviar. The palate boasts delicate apple and pear flavors that are layered with smoke, fresh fennel and a deliciously herbaceous finish."
Riesling,"While demure on the nose, this dry, seemingly diminutive Riesling builds in power and concentration on the palate. It's fairly low in alcohol, with an unassuming gradation of flavors ranging from lime to lemon and grapefruit, but its rippling textural expanse lends persistence and gravitas."
Riesling,"While it does not have strong intensity, this is a wine that packs pleasure. It is fruity and rounded, with plenty of green apple and white fruit flavors. There is an attractive tang of citrus that adds lift to the finish. Enjoy soon."
Riesling,"An obvious, fruity kabinett, with ample body and off-dry character, Ehlen's 2007 Erdener Treppchen boasts ripe melon aromas and flavors underscored by hints of nectarine and a squirt of citrus."
Riesling,"Wet stone and lemon set the tone when it comes to scent. The palate falls in with these themes and presents precision and poise; the razor-sharp freshness of lemon zest is both brightening and deliciously bracing. This is a svelte but concentrated wine of great purity that has not really come into its own yet. It is perfumed now but one cannot help but suspect much more development of aroma in the future. All the potential, concentration and balance is there. The finish is dry and lemony. Drink 2017–2030."
Riesling,"Wonderfully mellow and lifted flavors of ripe, aromatic apple rise from the glass. The same pure apple notes also play on the palate where they are pervaded by a zesty lifting freshness. This is precise and bone-dry, but the full expression of the tangy apple fruit gives this great richness and an clean finish."
Riesling,"A round, ripe pear and lemon nose opens this medium-weight, full flavored white. Grapefruit, spice and green apple coat the palate, the texture is fairly rich—maybe even fat for Riesling—but there's good acidity to support the fruit. Finishes long with white peach and mineral notes."
Riesling,"There's an earthy savoriness that adds shades of mystery to this otherwise sunny, sweet, delicate Riesling. It's concentrated with ripe yellow peach and honey flavors, but balanced with penetrating acidity and a murmur of crushed stones on the finish."
Riesling,"Dried apricot, jasmine, flower, herb and peach aromas are followed by medium, sweet fruit flavors that can't quite sustain their intensity but still bring appeal."
Riesling,"While a touch weightier in mouthfeel, Schloss Vollrad's standard-label bottling, this boasts the same peach and pink-grapefruit intensity that's so appealing on the Kabinett. Edged by a lacy fray of sugar, it's lip-smackingly sweet, but irresistably quaffable and neatly balanced by a streak of tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2020."
Riesling,"Apple and citrus scents mark the nose, and then the wine adds mineral notes of crushed vitamins on the palate. It's plump and medium in body, with a crisp, citrusy-minerally finish that would go well alongside Asian dishes without too much sweetness or spice."
Riesling,"In a departure from Mosel stereotypes, this wine is missing the floral fragrance and vivacity so typical of the region. But it remains impressive, offering plenty of concentration and density, hugely mineral aromas and flavors that call to mind molten rocks and even an oily texture and viscous finish. How it will age is impossible to predict, so drink it over the next 2–3 years."
Riesling,"Juicy and ripe with flavors of peach, tangerine and apple, this is an easy-drinking, off-dry Riesling. Delicately structured, it finishes moderately long with a pleasantly bitter lime pith note."
Riesling,"Unlike most Australian Rieslings, this one is a bit sweet (off dry, really). Hints of honey and bergamot bring complexity to the ripe, peachy flavors of this muscular wine, finishing with a dusty, tactile sensation. Drink now-2025."
Riesling,"While certainly present, apple and stone fruit take a back seat to layers of flint and smoke on this uniquely savory, dry Riesling. Slightly viscous on the palate with a rich, minerally slick, there's a hint of sea salt on the finish making this wine the perfect accompaniment to oysters on the half shell."
Riesling,"Sourced from the Dineen vineyard, this is unusually tart, almost sour, and feels thin on the palate. Some citrus flavors combine with a light touch of body powder, but overall it comes through as a very racy, light white wine."
Riesling,"Notes of stone and smoke join lemon and green apple on the nose of this wine. The palate has an earthier aspect but is bracingly fresh and precise with pure lemon zestiness. Dry and slender, the wine will round out with some bottle age. Drink 2018–2023."
Riesling,This wine is a shining example of the glorious minerality that singles out Mosel Riesling. The nose shows really appealing pear and gardenia scents overlaying wet stone notes. The mouthwatering acidity wakes up your palate and is in perfect balance with the substantial residual sugar. Drink now (with sushi) or hold five or more years for even more complexity.
Riesling,"This is Riesling done in a forward and fruity style, showing a mix of peach, apple and pear flavors. Broad and accessible, it finishes with a sweet dusting of powdered sugar."
Riesling,"This Riesling is blended with both Chenin Blanc and Gewürztraminer. The residual sugar is not listed, but the flavors are definitely sweet, without  much acidity to cut through the sugary finish."
Riesling,Blossom and citrus inform the nose—white jasmine hovers alongside grapefruit and orange. The palate is juicy and full of bouncy easy fruit on a fluid dryish body. Bright lemon freshness makes the fruit flavors even more vivid. The balance between fruit and freshness gives this tension and makes it very moreish. The finish is clean and orange scented.
Riesling,"Ripe red apple and peach notes perfume this zippy off-dry Riesling. Light bodied and lemony fresh, it's invigorating on the palate. Finishes moderately long, accented by whispers of saffron and spice. Drink now through 2020."
Riesling,"Just slightly off-dry, this excellent bottle mixes its ripe lemon, orange and papaya fruit with breakfast tea-like flavors. Its acidity is ample enough to keep the sweetness at bay, making it a fine, all-purpose wine that should please a wide variety of palates."
Riesling,"Stainless-steel fermented, technically off-dry but still quite citrusy and bracing, this continues a string of excellent Rieslings from Anam Cara. The fruit flavors blend seamlessly, invoking apples and pears, melons and peaches. A sense of Meyer lemon custard permeates the palate, concentrated and delicious."
Riesling,"Once the first whiff of yeast has worn off, a very pure, linear procession of citrus flavors presents itself: from the yellowish green of grapefruit to the greenish orange of a tangy tangerine, always with a deeper, more resonant core of earth and stone. The zestiness glistens on the surface, the tightly closed, still earthy fruit broods at the core. Wait for it to explode. Drink 2018–2028."
Riesling,The nose is very restrained: barely an aroma escapes. The palate comes in with shy reticent freshness but reveals a serious vein of grapefruit zestiness underneath. This has ample freshness that needs to be teased out. The finish is dry and clean.
Riesling,"A slick of wax and lanolin lends a mineral tone to bright apple cider and honey notes in this sprightly semisweet Riesling. Spine-tingling with acidity, it's an elegant, classically styled wine with a pristine, fruit-focused finish."
Riesling,"Fresh lime and lemon acidity abounds in this cool, steely wine. Delicately sweet, it offers sweet and tart tangerine flavors, augmented by edges of steel and crushed minerality."
Riesling,"A lovely touch of orange zest teases the nose and there also is a lovely hint of chervil. The streamlined palate comes in with bundled citrus notes. The tart flesh of tangerine and the zest of lemon are softened and enriched with orange oil and ample concentration. This is pure and racy, linear and bold. There is something salty and energetic, something incredibly fresh and vibrant at the core. The palate and finish are absolutely dry, the echo is long and clean. Blastingly fresh right now, sure to evolve. Drink 2019–2037."
Riesling,"Aromas like melon and almond, then flavors like peach and honey make a sophisticated blend in this dry, light-bodied wine. It has vibrant acidity for good balance and richness in texture that lingers on the finish. The name refers to the egg-shaped concrete vats used for fermentation."
Riesling,"Spice and cream dominate this attractive wine. With its full flavors of spice and pear, there is a also a hint of flower. An attractive wine that is developing quickly."
Riesling,"Lifted chamomile joins riper pear and apple fruit on the nose of this wine. On the concentrated palate these are joined by lemon and grapefruit zest in an unapologetically bracing style. This wine is clean, dry, fresh and totally lip-smacking with the full force of citrus behind it."
Riesling,"Fairly priced for an auslese of this quality, Nicolay's 2009 from the Bernkasteler Badstube is lean yet luscious, with a wiry frame of taut citrus upon which hang riper notes of ripe peaches and apricots. The finish is long and vibrant, echoing with pure fruity deliciousness."
Riesling,"Tight, bright acidity leads off this elegant, perfumed wine. With its white fruit and citrus flavors it is both rich and refreshing. A fine mineral streak runs right through this complex, certainly ageworthy wine."
Riesling,"Lean and tightly focused, this looks like one for the cellar—try it around 2018 if you can wait. Right now, it shows modest, restrained citrus fruit, hints of wet stone and a wickedly long, sinewy finish."
Riesling,"This wine's aromas are slightly reserved at first, recalling yellow pear and chalk. The flavors are also restrained on the zippy palate, with Asian pear and honeysuckle hints. But what it lacks in expressivity it makes up for in crispness and textural grip."
Riesling,"While still vibrantly peachy and floral, four years of bottle aging have given this off-dry Riesling sumptuous tertiary complexities of dusty mineral and white mushroom. It's feather light on the palate yet deeply penetrating in honeyed tangerine and stone fruit flavors. Drink now through 2021."
Riesling,"Wisps of smoke and crushed stones lend complexity to fresh apple and pear notes on this delicate, lace-textured wine. Electric lemon-line acid strikes a mean chord on the palate, but hints of sweet peach and apricot even out the finish."
Riesling,"Delivers strawberries, resin and golden raisins upfront while exotic spices dominate the palate. Petroleum notes on the finish indicate that it has already reached maturity though the fresh acidity will allow it to improve for a few more years in bottle."
Riesling,"A complex nose unites freshly cut russet-pear peel, ripe red apple and juicy, yellow Mirabelle plum, with a spicy touch of pepper. The palate shows oodles of that juicy Mirabelle, framed with tangy ripe lemon and bright tangerine. All this comes in a streamlined, concentrated but sleek shape with briskness and dryness. The long finish tingles with zesty spice."
Riesling,"Hints of dusty mineral and caramelized sugar lend complexity to deep, penetrating layers of honey, peach and yellow plum in this light-footed, yet resounding, kabinett. Delicately sweet and puckering with lemon-lime acidity, it's a deftly balanced wine that resonates long on the finish. Drink now through 2021."
Riesling,"There is something floral and tender, even creamy on the nose. The palate on the one side has a creamy apricot and peach aspect, on the other a totally taut and brisk lemon-lime streak. This makes for tension and interest. This is concentrated and exciting, dry and very, very enjoyable. Drink now through 2025."
Riesling,"Lemon rind and fresh, green herbs add a flash of elegance to this dry, intensely textural Riesling. It's lush and rich with stonefruit flavor, but bristles on the palate with lime pith and jasmine tea astringency. Sunny and bright, but brisk with acidity."
Riesling,"Mellow inviting aromas of baked apple make for an attractive nose. The palate adds tart lemon freshness to these lovely and rounded apple flavors and thus creates a lovely contrast. This is dry and fruit driven, lemony and sleek."
Riesling,"This off-dry Riesling awakens the palate with a piercing strike of lemon-lime acidity, but recovers quickly with pliant layers of sweet berries, yellow cherries and pear. It's sharp and brisk, but mouthwatering and juicy."
Riesling,Wonderfully concentrated notes of ripe mirabelle plums open up on the nose. There also is a heady lemon note. The palate is rich with the same fleshy ripe fruit but has a fault line of zesty orange at its core that provides focus and seems to illuminate clouds of ripe aromatic citrus at every turn. This shimmers with tangerine and clementine. The body is immensely concentrated but has total direction and drive. Enjoy 2020–2040.
Riesling,"Smoke and dried herb notes accent sunny citrus and peach aromas on this refreshingly off-dry Riesling. Flavors of tart stone fruit and tangerine bristle on the palate, finishing crisply, with a hint of floral perfume."
Riesling,"Green herb and crisp apple notes lend a refreshing kick to pretty white floral and honeydew flavors in this brisk, intensely concentrated wine. It's semi-dry in style with a delicate, honeyed sweetness that lingers."
Riesling,This easy and straightforward white boasts pleasant notes of fresh apple and lemon-lime citrus throughout. The palate is lush but braced with medium acidity that lingers into the close. Enjoy it now.
Riesling,"The winery offers this bottling as a counterpart to their dry Riesling, but there's not much separation between the two. Its 10 g/L of residual sugar is certainly above threshhold, but with the searingly tart acidity underneath, it barely makes a dent. Citrus and apple flavors come through, but the sour lemon acidity is what dominates."
Riesling,"Heady violet and stone fruit aromas are swathed in fresh, green herbs on the nose of this honeyed, elegantly fruity kabinett. Brisk acidity reverberates on the palate, where sweet fruit then mixes with a long, mineral-tinged finish. Drink now through 2014 to maximize its fresh, floral exuberance."
Riesling,"Notes of peach and ripe, yellow plum join a mix of citrus flavors that range from spiky lime to fruity clementine, making for a friendly, refreshing and dry Riesling. Its freshness brightens the palate and shows highlights of pineapple"
Riesling,"Kalkmergel refers to the chalky marl soils, which are said to yield powerful and mineral wines. This is a wonderfully complex example, with scents of musk, quince and brine all combining easily into a knockout aroma. It's citrusy and fresh, with a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2016, possibly longer."
Riesling,"Slightly more advanced notes stand out: a herbal tinge of sun-warmed, wild thyme has crept into the citrus peel which utterly dominates the palate. This sleek Smaragd has just started on its long ascent. It has the toned muscle and the stamina to go on and on—those who have enjoyed older vintages know of its near eternal youthfulness. On the aftertaste, herbal notes assert themselves again: dried tisane of verbena and dried apple punctuate with pleasant accents."
Riesling,"With its light touch and fresh acidity over the delicate honey flavors, this is an immediately delicious dessert wine that doesn't dominate by knock-out richness, but by its finesse. Acidity goes hand in hand with the ripe pineapple and peach flavors. Worth aging, maybe 4–5 years. Glass stopper."
Riesling,"Intensely mineral, this dry, laser-focused Riesling expresses the stark purity of Mosel's 2013 vintage. Shimmering acidity bristles the palate, accentuating fresh apple and pear flavors. The finish is cool, steely and long."
Riesling,"Lifted lemon purity, cushioned by riper stone fruit, especially yellow plum and greengage, makes this a complete and super-refreshing, fruity number."
Riesling,"Layers of sweet orange marmalade, citrus rind and pollen mingle seamlessly into this deliciously honeyed ice wine. Intensely ripe, almost creamy in texture, its succulent sweetness is balanced neatly by a dazzling spray of tangerine acidity."
Riesling,"This moderately aromatic wine offers notes of pear, citrus and apricot. It drinks medium sweet with stone-fruit and citrus flavors along with spritely acidity, bringing a whole lot of appeal."
Riesling,"This is sourced from old vines, and brings typically intense, phenolic aromatics in a dry, extended and lingering style. Citrus-rind scents and dried-apple flavors abound, and it's textural and persistent, though not what you'd call fruity. The length and development are its best attributes."
Riesling,"Rich, ripe yellow cherries and honeysuckle waft from this luxuriously honeyed off-dry Riesling. A sweet tangerine flavor is densely concentrated on the palate, yet the wine is sprightly and zesty in mouthfeel. An elegant floral spray extends the long, lingering finish."
Riesling,"A hint of tropicality hovers above the nose, recalling passion fruit. The palate restricts itself to fresh lemon and green apple. This is light, dry, juicy and refreshing—ideal for a sunny day as a light apéritif."
Riesling,"The winery's first 'Sweet Riesling' is somewhat aromatically reticent for the variety with notes of lychee, jasmine and apricot. The palate lives up to the label though with sweet (70g/L residual sugar) apricot and fresh mango flavors that linger on the finish."
Riesling,"Hugely ripe, this is a dense and potentially intense wine. Its high alcohol brings out a disturbing pepper character that spoils the purity of the rich fruits and mineral texture. It shows the heat of the volcanic soil of Ragen de Thann Grand Cru in its rich fruits and ripe structure. It does need aging, so drink from 2017."
Riesling,"Hints of spice and a spritz of effervescence lend vibrance to this brisk, tangerine-­scented Riesling. It's just a shade off dry, with striking lemon-lime acidity that highlights delicate flavors of peach and apricot. Effortlessly quaffable."
Riesling,"A hint of exotic spice adds dimension to the freshly pressed apple and tangerine skin notes on the nose and palate of this off-dry Riesling. Intense, ripe fruit is balanced by bracing lime-juice acidity that lingers long on the finish."
Riesling,"Fresh and appley, but restrained overall, with just a whisper of smoke and nuts, this semidry Riesling is refreshingly quaffable. A honeyed sweetness that lingers on the finish."
Riesling,"There's so much sweet fruit intensity to this lip-smackingly tasty Riesling. Simultaneously, it's brisk and bright on the palate with bristling tangerine acidity and a hint of fresh herbal tones on the finish."
Riesling,"Crisp and steely, touched by white perfumes and intense acidity, this is a wine with a sharp blade of flavors that cut through the texture. Apples, citrus and kumquat all blend attractively together."
Riesling,"An uber aromatic wine with notes of flowers, orange peel, jasmine and canned peaches. At 27.2 g/L residual sugar, it drinks medium sweet but overall, the acid keeps it in check."
Riesling,"Earth, apple, citrus and herb all mingle on nose. Green apple tinged with chamomile edge strikes against bright lemon on the dry palate. This is full of refreshing citrus and a beautifully understated vigor which will live in this wine for years to come. The finish culminates in a gorgeously tart but ripe apple notion. Very moreish now and approachable but with lots of future promise. Drink 2017–2030."
Riesling,"Sweet and lithe, this is a wonderfully clean and pure expression of Riesling eiswein. There's no botrytis, only sweet pineapple, apple and citrus flavors that finish on lingering notes of orange and lemon. This should last a while in the cellar, but there's really no reason to delay gratification."
Riesling,"The nose on Keuka Lake's Evergreen Lek Vineyard is wonderfully intriguing with dark notes of smoke, petrol and brine accented by hits of ripe, yellow peach. Dry on the palate with nuances of dark steel, smoke and orange peel, this medium-bodied Riesling is brightened by a flash of fresh orange acidity and sweet grapefruit pith on the finish."
Riesling,"Powerful spicy and smoky aromas join honeydew melon and honey flavors in this sweet, mouth-coating yet light-bodied wine from the second-generation German immigrant family of Schug."
Riesling,"While a touch weightier in mouthfeel, Schloss Vollrad's standard-label bottling, this boasts the same peach and pink-grapefruit intensity that's so appealing on the Kabinett. Edged by a lacy fray of sugar, it's lip-smackingly sweet, but irresistably quaffable and neatly balanced by a streak of tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2020."
Riesling,"There is a warm, honeyed edge to this otherwise steely, very crisp wine. It gives richness, counterpointing the delicate citrus and fennel flavors. The wine can age, but is ready to drink now and until 2020."
Riesling,"Bright with fresh apple and pear aromas, this off-dry style Riesling is a sunny, cheerful wine that melds the sweetness of tangerines with a high-toned acidity."
Riesling,"A whiff of pine frond lends an invigorating alpine air to this lean, refreshingly mineral dry Riesling. The palate is crisp and cutting, bursting with fresh lime, gooseberry and quince flavors. Zesty acidity draws out a long, piercing finish. Drink now through 2020."
Riesling,"Sweet green apple, lemon and lime notes meld in this off-dry Riesling, somewhat evocative of green Jolly Rancher's candy. Whiffs of smoke and nuts add a savory dimension to this brisk, easy drinking wine. Drink now."
Riesling,"This wine, which comes from thin, granitic soils, is lean, taut and dry. Hints of lime blossom and green apple on the nose and palate give it a springtime feel, while the finish is crisp and refreshing."
Riesling,"Clean, poised, lemony freshness on an arrow-straight body. Zesty refreshment in one clean and compact package."
Riesling,"Starts off with aromas of green gage plum and hints of honey, but on the palate this is powerful and tightly coiled. It even seems a bit lean at this stage, with a bit of spritz, but expect it to improve markedly over the next 2–3 years. For now, the potential is all evident in the tremendous length on the finish."
Riesling,"The nose is still dominated by funky yeast, signaling that this Riesling requires time in bottle. The streamlined palate reveals something that is equally generous and tart, like pink grapefruit or pomelo. There is a lovely phenolic texture, too, with intimations of riper fruit in the background that will still take their time to appear. Best to let this slumber for a while in a cool cellar. Drink as of 2018."
Riesling,"Layers of spice, lanolin and orange rind stand out curiously on this intriguing Riesling fermented spontaneously with indigenous yeast, and subject to 5 months on its lees. It's strikingly brisk with tart, lemony acidity, but rich with a rustic, savory apple flavor. It's a funky, thoroughly unique wine, but also a remarkably complex wine to savor through the course of a long evening."
Riesling,"Even in cooler 2007, Zull scores with this wine. It has all the right pear and apple perfumes, along with vibrant acidity and minerality. It's going to develop well over the next 4 years into a fine, elegant wine. Screwcap."
Riesling,"Subtle smoke notes accent tangerine, lemon and lime in this invigorating dry Riesling. Fermented via ambient yeast, its refinement and restrained elegance sets it apart from Casa Larga's other Rieslings. The finish is lingering yet fresh."
Riesling,"Pineapple fruit rings out loud and clear, with a slightly grainy, though not sweet, entrance. A blocky but powerfully fruity Riesling, with overtones of orange peel and black tea."
Riesling,"Exhilarating tropical perfume leaps from the glass of this intensely aromatic Trockenbeerenauslese. Sweet peach and tangerine flavors are exceptionally concentrated, swathed by caramel and saffron. It's delightfully light in body but lavishly textured, filling the palate with waves of pristine fruit. Stunning already but will improve for decades to come."
Riesling,"Broad in the mouth and rather burly, this nearly dry Riesling offers minerally, spice-driven aromas and flavors. A touch of honeyed richness on the palate rounds it out, but this is not a stereotypical fruity Riesling despite the mouthwatering finish."
Riesling,"Dry and crisply detailed, this delicious, bracing Riesling combines refreshing minerality with delicate yet complex fruit flavors of apple, pear and tangerine. It's full-bodied and drinking beautifully, but has the structure to develop over a decade or more. You decide whether to enjoy it now or tuck it away."
Riesling,"A bit more austere than some of Kilikanoon's other cuveés, Mort's Block is in it for the long haul. Still a baby, it currently shows lemon-lime characters, with kerosene and Barbie doll plastic. The palate is linear and supercitrusy. Drink 2018–2025."
Riesling,"The merest touch of tropicality, of ripe passion fruit, hovers on the nose before lemon and orange kick in. The palate still has an edge of reduction but that is a good and reassuring sign. There is a rich core of ripe poised fruit: tangerine and aromatic oranges are firmly held with grapefruit freshness. There is a beautiful juxtaposition of generosity and tangy freshness. The finish is lip-smacking and utterly fresh—that rich core of fruit invites you to sip and explore again and again."
Riesling,"Striking lemon-lime acidity penetrates through this zesty, dry-style Riesling. It's spry and lean, marked by crisp green apples and pears and finishes briskly, accented by layers of dusty minerals. Drink now–2016."
Riesling,"Sunny tangerine acidity showers over plump honeydew and yellow plums in this lip-smacking, opulent spätlese. Refreshing grapefruit and green floral notes kiss the long, lingering finish. It's youthful exuberance shines, but it's likely to mature elegantly till at least 2025."
Riesling,"Sun-kissed peaches and apricots burst from the nose and palate of this delightfully sweet-tart, off-dry wine. Despite its delicate footprint, it's lusciously concentrated, with a creamy, mouthfilling texture. The finish is long and vibrantly citrusy."
Riesling,"Smoke and spice meld into scents of custard and pressed apple on this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. The palate is a bit monotone with savory apple notes, but brightened by a streak of lemon on the finish."
Riesling,"Quite savory in style, this dry full-bodied Riesling suggests pressed apple and pear flavors marked by brisk slightly puckering acidity. A touch of sweet spice warms a moderately long finish."
Riesling,"Well-known winemaker Ben Riggs deserves credit for this wine, which balances sugar and acid so deftly that it's hard to tell if this is off-dry or just genuinely fruit-ripe. It's a fuller style than many Australian Rieslings, but pulls it off, packing in lemon-lime and honey notes. The finish is long and textured, just to the point of balanced bitterness. Ready to drink."
Riesling,"Fresh gooseberry, lemon and apple skin dominate the nose here, carrying over to the medium-weight palate. Although the acid seems a bit apart from the rest of the wine, this Barossa Riesling is pleasantly crisp, with nice spice and candied apple notes. Drink now to 2012."
Riesling,"Opens with immense, luscious aromas of apricot liqueur, vanilla custard, fennel, orange blossom and honeysuckle. Explodes on the palate with enormous fruit and spice flavors; it’s intense and concentrated. Very sweet, but the acidity is high and cleansing. It has a velvety texture, and finishes long and sweet. Enjoy it with vanilla ice cream or crème brûlée"
Riesling,"Smoke and crushed mineral notes, along with a lean, herbal tone, make this off-dry Riesling especially elegant and savory in style. Lime zest and lemon flavors fill the mouth with vital energy. It finishes moderately long, on a juicy tangerine note."
Riesling,"A rich, nutty note hints at hazelnut, with lively citrus laying underneath. This vein of lemony verve leads the melody like the soaring, unfettered notes of a violin against a sonorous background. This will always be firm but once it opens up, it will be even more harmonious and beguiling. Drink from 2020."
Riesling,"Enticingly complex nose, multifaceted, with a medley of blossoms, honey, spice, white peaches and ample minerality showing through. Sweet, with delicious racy acidity and a lively taut texture. This is very focused, with generous flavors of elderberries, stone fruit, orange citrus, spice and slate. Long, persistent finish."
Riesling,"Even at a considerable 15 g/l of residual sugar, this wine comes across as almost dry, thanks to its crisp acidity. Scents of petrichor, green apple and lime start things off, while those razor-sharp acids show up on the finish. Drink now."
Riesling,"Fresh tangerine skins scent this zesty dry Riesling. Restrained on the palate with flavors of pressed apple and pear, it's not a deeply concentrated wine but refreshing and brisk."
Riesling,"A strike of tangerine acidity serves as a palate jolting introduction to this vibrant sun-kissed Riesling. Dusty mineral, pollen and honey tones converge into a luscious slick that lingers persistently and persuasively."
Riesling,"Fresh cantaloupe aromas shift to savory pressed apple and pear on the palate of this juicy, easygoing Riesling. Semidry in style, it's pleasantly slick and sweet, accented by spice and honey notes. Drink now."
Riesling,"Already mature, this is a full-bodied, perfumed wine full of stone-fruit and toast notes. It has a bitter almond character that gives the wine an edginess while spice lends a peppery sensation to the palate. Drink now before it fades."
Riesling,"A quiver of silk lends richness to the palate of this dry, relatively full-bodied Riesling. Stark lime-lemon acidity is tart and bracing, but ripe pear and apple notes add flesh and persistence to the finish."
Riesling,"Concentrated, firm, touched by caramel, this wine starts out intensely fruity. Then texture, mineral and fruit skins come in to play. The wine is impressively complete, its acidity ratcheted up a notch by the fine floral, green and white fruit flavors."
Riesling,"This is an intense expression of steely Riesling, with a complex structure and excellent aging potential. It is full of citrus, pear and crisp pineapple flavors that are laced with concentrated acidity. Age for at least five years. Screwcap."
Riesling,"Smoke and caramelized sugar notes lend a sultry tone to this racy, streamlined Kabinett. It's vibrant and laced with fresh green and herbal notes, replacing more typical stone-fruit flavors. Delicate honey sweetness lingers softly on the finish."
Riesling,"Whiffs of candle wax and lime zest accent pretty floral notes on this slightly off-dry Riesling. Flavors of yellow cherries and peach are juicy and ripe on the palate, extended through the finish with steely streaks of mineral and acid. It's an elegant wine with power and complexity."
Riesling,The sand and granite soil of the Brand vineyard gives an intensely structured wine that's tight and steely. It's rich with apricot and pear flavors made crisp with refreshing acidity. Drink from 2015.
Riesling,"The green apple, apple skin and flower aromas pop. The off-dry peach flavors keep you coming back for more."
Riesling,"Perfumed notes of honey and tangerine are accented by savory accents of pollen on the nose of this complex spätlese. Concentrated stone fruit and pineapple flavors fall lusciously on the palate, offset by sprays of acidity. It's pristinely fruity yet nuanced and mineral. Enjoy now for its freshness, but it will improve through 2027 and hold for another decade."
Riesling,"Evocative hints of orange and tangerine peel softly rise from the glass. This leads onto zesty citrus flavors and a wonderfully streamlined, effortlessly powerful palate bursting with freshness and life. You may not readily associate Weinviertel with Riesling but in this single stony site it works incredibly well!"
Riesling,"Fragrant on the nose with aromas of fresh apples accented with herbs and spice, this dry, full-bodied wine bristles on the palate with lemon and lime acidity. Ripe yellow peach and nectarine flavors fill out the midpalate and linger on the finish. It's straightforward in style yet deliciously quaffable."
Riesling,"Lovely pure notes of lemon zest and juice swirl on nose and palate. The slender palate bounces them back and shines with clarity and transparency, as smooth as the undisturbed surface of a mountain lake with an impressive and lasting lemon finish."
Riesling,"Fragrant notes of white blossom and peach waft from this juicy off-dry Riesling. Creamy and luscious in texture, it offers concentrated tangerine and stone-fruit flavors balanced briskly with acidity. It's an uncomplicated but lip-smacking sip to enjoy now through 2018."
Riesling,"The nose of this pretty kabinett starts off demure, wafting fresh grapefruit, sage and lavender scents. The palate, by contrast, boasts tropical mango and berry tones. Boldly concentrated and brisk in acidity, it's a punchy, four-square Riesling with appeal well into the 2020s."
Riesling,"Nickolaihof produces intense, full-flavored Rieslings that age more quickly than Wachau Rieslings from further west. This is a silky, creamy wine, full of white fruit flavors, seared through with crisp acidity, enormously concentrated, with a bone-dry finish."
Riesling,"This generously fruited but slender Riesling is a study in subtlety: everything is there: ripe Mirabelle plums, zesty lemon peel and a wonderful interplay of the two on the concentrated palate. Yet nothing is big or bold. Listen and you will be rewarded."
Riesling,"Freshly pressed apple and pear are brightened by squirts of lemon and lime in this refreshing dry Riesling. Zesty and spry, it's a thirst-quenching wine for everyday drinking now through 2018."

Riesling,"Chalk and slate meld into blossomy floral tones in this fragrant off-dry Riesling. Zesty and spry, the palate is marked by flavors of freshly pressed apple, pear and lemon. Drink now through 2020."
Riesling,"Pure, poised citrus lift combines pink and yellow grapefruit peel on the nose, with more cushioning on the textured, concentrated palate. A stony, mineral background plays against the lively, bright acid that leaves you wanting more."
Riesling,"Aromas of pear, red apple and pineapple lead to sweet green and red apple flavors with a tart finish."
Riesling,"Such an elegant wine, with its attractive crisp apple skin and ripe pear juice flavors. It has a fine perfumed character, laced intensely with acidity. Drink now."
Riesling,"Subtle aromas of freshly cut grass and crisp Asian pears make this clean, dry Riesling a refreshing sipping wine. A tingly acidity and citrus pith notes linger playfully on the palate."
Riesling,"Whiffs of smoke and spice add complexity to this remarkably inexpensive, tasty Riesling. Off dry in style, with delicate white peach and apricot flavors, it's brightened by lime acidity and hints of savory herbs. Drink now."
Riesling,"A pleasantly savory touch of earth and nut on the nose lends complexity to this lusciously citrusy dry wine. Fresh white grapefruit, lemon and lime flavors are penetrating on the palate, glazed by a luminous sheen of crushed minerals and cutting acidity. Light bodied yet rippling in texture, it's a deeply satisfying Riesling to enjoy now through at least 2030."
Riesling,"Fresh green herbs and tart stone-fruit aromas waft delicately from this dry, remarkably juicy wine. The palate bursts with ripe white peach and nectarine flavor accented with bright, zesty lime acidity."
Riesling,Tender notes of lemon on the nose segue into riper citrus notes on the palate. This is a taut but textured wines which has a concentrated palate with an almost oily feel. Zesty lemon notes provide freshness. The finish is dry and lasting and this is sure to develop over the coming years. Drink 2017–2025.
Riesling,"Bright smells of freshly shredded lemongrass and orange blossom lift off of this Riesling that gets an aromatic boost from 11% Gewürztraminer. On the palate, it is smooth but slightly sweet, with orange soda flavors and a nice herbal twist of chamomile tea."
Riesling,"Starting out a touch reduced, this wine shows aromas of lime leaf and peach, wanting a bit more aromatic clarity. It drinks off dry, with lean but plentiful lime and stone-fruit flavors."
Riesling,"Delicate whiffs of spice and pine lend depth to crisp-tart white peach and grapefruit flavors in this spry yet penetrating Riesling. Dry on the palate, it's finely textured, as if etched by its acidity and stony mineral tones. It finishes with juicy, concentrated stone fruit flair. Drinks well now but should meld beautifully through 2024."
Riesling,"Smoke and dusty mineral notes juxtapose ripe, sweet peach and apricot flavors in this fruity but complex wine. It's as savory as it is sweet, accented by spicy notes of saffron and bee pollen. The finish is long, pristine and refreshing."
Riesling,"This is a very closed, terroir-driven wine with a mineral character. With its tight structure and flavors of green fruit and spice, it is a wine for aging. Screwcap."
Riesling,"Creamy and textural, this brings on a nice mix of apple, pear and Key lime fruit flavors, fresh and pretty. Just a hint of minerality adds interest to the finish."
Riesling,Savory aromas like chicken stock and dried herbs lead to light cucumber flavors and a lean body and dry texture.
Riesling,"Delicate tones of crushed stone and dried apricot entice on the nose of this silken yet steely dry wine. Despite its moderate alcohol, there's a robustness on the palate marked by concentrated white peach and apricot flavors. That steely precision rings through the finish though, bolstered by a nervy streak of lemon and lime acidity."
Riesling,"This lively Riesling offers aromas of citrus, apricot and honey, followed by layers of white fruit, spice and pepper. The wine has a slightly sweet fruity character but it's balanced by acid and minerals. A fun but impressive Riesling."
Riesling,"Hints of lemongrass and blossom lend lavish perfume to flavors of peach and cantaloupe in this ripe, richly fruity wine. Medium-sweet in style, it's backed by a piercing lemon acidity and zest notes that linger on the finish."
Riesling,"This is ripe and smooth, with a generous creamy texture. Spice and apple combine to give a tangy edge that will soften and integrate as the wine ages. It's full of potential. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,"This bottling is usually among the more opulent, successful white dessert wines in California, and the '07 certainly fits that bill. With 20.1% residual sugar, it's fantastically sweet, yet has enough fruity stuffing, balanced by high acidity, to satisfy. The pineapple, apricot and orange flavors could be somewhat more intense but it's certainly a very delicious dessert wine."
Riesling,"The slightly off-dry profile (12g/L residual sugar) perfectly complements the ultraripe, deeply concentrated fruit. It's downright plush, with ripe apple and pear tart flavors. Young as it is, you may not want to wait to drink this one."
Riesling,"Rich, viscous and sweet, this is a spätlese that punches above its weight. A bit of dried apricot hints at the inclusion of some botrytized grapes, while the rest of the fruit shows superripe flavors of peaches and honey. This is long on the finish, clinging to the palate. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC."
Riesling,"Packaged in a plain, stylish bottle with the RR logo prominently displayed, this reserve-level cuvée brings concentrated flavors of citrus, apple, peach and pear, along with highlights of wet paper, fresh herb and lemongrass. Despite 12 g/L of residual sugar, the finish tilts a bit sour."
Riesling,"An unusual nose of cinnamon, lychee and Christmas spice holds promise. Unfortunately, the palate is one-dimensional and lacking in flavor intensity, though some pleasant banana flavors peak through briefly before dropping in to a short finish."
Riesling,"Aromatically, this wine is still shy on nose and palate. Underneath that the linearity and inherent slenderness of ripe tangerine flesh and zest come though, enriched with an earthy notion of ripe pear. The palate is dry and energetic, but also still rather closed. The true colors are revealed on the finish, with a lasting pear note bundled on the concentrated, linear palate. Drink 2019–2030."
Riesling,"Smoke and crushed mineral notes open this dry, lusciously textured Riesling. It's slightly savory on the palate, with layers of apple and pear struck by zesty lime and lemon acidity. Powerful and structured, it penetrates long and lean on the finish."
Riesling,"A touch of luscious peach plays among the ripe lemon notes of the nose. A heady chamomile lift hints at some evolution. The absolutely dry palate is still vividly fresh and has barely begun to unfurl its store of rich aromas. For now the luminous freshness and brightness of pure ripe lemon zest still dominates. Here and there a touch of candle wax, stone and chamomile appears. From the 2011, this has barely begun its journey. A lovely, incisive, intense but elegant wine with a clean refreshing finish. Drink 2017–2030."
Riesling,"While ebulliently peachy and floral on the nose, savory notes of dried reeds and savory herbs overwhelm the fruit flavors in this dry, light-bodied Riesling. It's crisp and refreshingly composed, but finishes a bit short. Drink now."
Riesling,"This is fairly sweet but not as sweet as you'd expect given its 7% residual sugar. Credit the vivid acidity built in to Washington Riesling grapes (though labeled American, the grapes are all Washington). It's got plenty of mixed fruits and as the back label suggests, it's a good choice to pair with spicy Asian foods."
Riesling,"Zesty limes and lemons brighten aromas of fresh pear on this irresistibly nimble-bodied Riesling. Ripe tangerine and peach flavors are semi-sweet on the palate, but zippy with acidity and a delicate fringe of minerals that lend complexity to the finish."
Riesling,"Juicy and off-dry, this succulent Riesling pushes orange and candied citrus flavors to the front of the bus, with a smooth, sweet but not sugary ride into the lingering finish. A final impression of spun sugar and marshmallow brings a smile."
Riesling,"Musky, floral perfume introduces this bright, candied Riesling full of sweet pink grapefruit and tangerine flavors. Crisp acidity freshens the mid palate but the finish is a touch caramelized. Drink now."
Riesling,"Restrained aromas of white peach and crushed minerals turn riper and bolder on the palate of this powerful auslese. Intensely honeyed and buoyantly peachy, it coats the palate in slicks of sweet nectar and vibrant tangerine acidity. It's a lavish, richly textured wine with lingering yet elegant sweetness."
Riesling,"Kirsten's Feinherb, or gently sweet bottling, maintains a firm foundation of stoniness, but also embraces softer, less angular dimensions of spring blossom and peach. High-toned acidity brighten and lifts the palate through a long finish. Drink now through 2021."
Riesling,"Generous streaks of caramel and honey seem to glaze this delectably sweet late-harvest Riesling. It's lusciously ripe, dripping with autumnal flavors of freshly pressed apples and pears, but bright tangerine acidity offers balance."
Riesling,"Initial whiffs of smoke and struck flint fade into pretty pineapple and blossom on the nose of this full-bodied, dry Riesling. Mango and tangerine flavors are riper and heftier on the palate than in many of the Mosel's 2015 Grosses Gewächs wines, neatly balanced by racy acidity and a backbone of cool steel. It's delicious already, but likely to evolve well through the 2020s at least."
Riesling,"2012 marks only the second vintage for winemaker Nathan Kendall, but this dry, exceptionally stony Riesling suggests a promising start already. Fermented spontaneously with indigenous yeast, it's exquisitely spry but concentrated in lime, blossom and white grapefruit notes."
Riesling,"Dried oregano and sage notes lend a dusty, savory tone to the nose of this racy, light-bodied kabinett. The palate, by contrast, surprises with layers of lush, ripe tropical fruit cut with a razor's edge of acidity and lime zest. Finishes snappy and bright."
Riesling,"Yellow grapefruit pith, white Asian pear flesh, cherimoya and crisp stonefruit elements show on the nose of this bottling, which also offers the typical touch of petrol. The palate is very pithy and high-toned, showing lemon rind, sour orange and sour apple on the finish."
Riesling,"Saffron and honey notes are earthy and dusty in profile, but add striking complexity to a palate that's concentrated with peach and orange flavors. Strong acidity cuts through layers of luscious honey and fruit, before finishing on a pleasantly floral note."
Riesling,"This is a sweet wine with flavors of white sugar, orange, honey and vanilla, all brightened by crisp acidity."
Riesling,"Classic Eden Valley aromas of lemon-lime sherbet and wet stone mark the nose of this medium-bodied wine. That wet stone note carries through on the palate to yield a slightly chalky or crushed-stone texture, while the citrus fruits race through the long finish. Drink 2020–2030."
Riesling,"Luscious peach and honeysuckle aromas are redolent on this dry, but somewhat perfumy Riesling. Broad and full on the palate, it's lushly textured, but with a bright streak of acidity that tightens the finish."
Riesling,"The purest, freshest note of lemon zest and lemon oil creates a dreamy nose. The palate brings in a stony texture that characterizes the entire wine. There is something enduring and stone-like about this, framed with lovely lemon purity. This has barely had time to express itself. There is more to be had from this wine in the future. The long echoes of stone and citrus promise that. Drink 2020–2035."
Riesling,"Fresh scents of orange zest and tangerine are tinged with smoke on this dry, piercingly lemony Riesling. The palate feels lean and steely, but is brightened by tart green apple and citrus notes on the midpalate. Finishes nervy and brisk."
Riesling,"From its floral, lime-driven aromas to its citrus and baked-apple flavors, this is a textbook Riesling. It's plump and friendly, offering a mouthfilling texture and easy-drinking appeal at a bargain price. Drink now."
Riesling,"This Riesling offers ripe aromas of apricot, citrus and rose petals, and flavors of peach and spice. On the palate, the ripe fruit flavors are a bit heavy, as the wine lacks the acid and balance of a great Riesling. Overall, though, a pretty wine that's both appealing and approachable."
Riesling,"Exotically floral and spicy, this delivers an intoxicating blend of exuberance and elegance. While delicately framed, the palate is rich, ripe and juicy, with sweet yellow-cherry and apricot flavors, and a slick of wax and honey. It's brisk and nervy, yet finishes remarkably long, with a swathe of green herbal tones."
Riesling,"Notes of sweet quince preserves, lilac and lavender gently perfume this aromatic late-harvest Riesling. Quite voluptuous in body, with rich fruit flavor and a lush, creamy texture, it finishes long, with a hint of sweetness that's balanced by brisk white-tea astringency."
Riesling,"Hints of cookie crumbs lend warmth to fresh apple and pear notes in this mineral-intense, dry Riesling. It's round and rich on the palate, but punctuated by tart, steely tones of acid and stone before finishing moderately long."
Riesling,"On the side, with a hint of warmth on the finish, this is nevertheless a very good wine. The aromas are powerfully mineral, accented by bold lime notes, while the flavors are intense and concentrated. Drink now."
Riesling,"This wine makes you work harder than many of its neighbors to find the flavor but it's worth the effort when you uncover an intriguing mélange of hay, apricot and early summer fruits. The crisp, minerally finish puts one in mind of a platter of choucroute garnie. Drink now to 2013."
Riesling,"Notions of ripe, red apple are deliciously pervaded by spiky lemon freshness, creating a tension between tart crispness and inviting ripeness—much like a perfectly balanced apple itself—just supercharged and concentrated. This seems to have a drive all of its own and a luminous, appetizing, irresistible fruitiness."
Riesling,"The restrained nose shows some white peach notes, lees and stony minerality. This is complex, layered and persistent across the palate, opening up to ample stone fruit flavors, earthy notes, dried herbs and spice. Crisp, with sweetness, moderately concentrated flavors and a rich texture all in balance, if a little loose knit on the finish."
Riesling,"While the nose is demure, the palate on this dainty auslese bursts of sweet yellow peaches and cherries. Luscious and clingy, it's irresistibly juicy, yet remarkably mineral and structured, with a nervous tension throughout. It's delicious now, yet should gain even more mineral complexity from 2020 and on."
Riesling,"This wine's aromas of baked apple, honey, cinnamon and brown sugar are immediately attractive, and in the mouth it doesn't disappoint. It's broad and mouthfilling but avoids heaviness, finishing long, with hints of orange rind."
Riesling,"Dandelion, earthiness and apple peel appear vividly on the nose, and a certain creaminess can also be discerned. The off-dry palate is incredibly fruity and boosts the sweetness of deliciously ripe apples while remaining absolutely tart and fresh. The finish is dry and fresh but this will echo any sweet element in an otherwise savory dish. Delicious and long. Drink 2017–2035."
Riesling,"Vibrant but slightly reduced aromas of canned pear, jasmine, flowers and peach are followed by off-dry-leaning sweeter fruit flavors. It brings appeal but needs more acid to stand it up."
Riesling,"Succulent yellow peach and honeydew flavors stand at the forefront of this slick, juicy Riesling. It's a delightfully sunny, fruit-forward wine, yet elegantly balanced, struck by line of lime acidity. The finish is moderately long, accompanied by a delicious ripple of lime-zest astringency."
Riesling,"Labeled dry, this nonetheless carries a hint of sweetness, at 70 g/L residual sugar.  It's fruity and fresh, with melon, citrus and peach prominent. A perfect summer sipping wine."
Riesling,"Perhaps a little overripe on the nose, this late harvest is high-toned and rather sharp in its attack. Concentrated peach, apricot, butter brickle and honey flavors carry the midpalate, but the finish turns bitter."
Riesling,"Fresh yellow peaches seem to be layered in honey and pollen throughout this lusciously sweet, lip-smacking Riesling. The midpalate bristles with acidity, but it's harmoniously balanced, bursting of fresh apples and lemons. The finish is elegant and long, laced in soft tea tannins."
Riesling,"Aromas of lemon-lime, jasmine and honeysuckle prepare the palate for crisp, clean flavors of lemon zest and lemon curd."
Riesling,This intense wine has great ripe fruit and sweetness to go with the pear and honey flavors. There is great acidity and beautiful fruit character in a gorgeous wine that still keeps its style and freshness.
Riesling,"Dusty mineral tones accent bright peach and apricot flavors on this slightly off-dry Riesling. Tart lemon-lime acidity lends brightness to the palate, extending a finish flecked with dried, savory herbs."
Riesling,"Delicate mineral inflections lend elegance to flavors of pink grapefruit and peach on this sprightly semi-dry Riesling. Sunny with soft, Meyer-lemon acidity, it's a bit dainty on the palate but has enough power to drive a moderately long finish."
Riesling,"The fogs that roll off the nearby ocean (only one ridge away) give the Riesling the perfect conditions for botrytis. Harvested in mid-October, the wine has a fine balance of rich honeyed fruit and intense acidity. Yellow fruits and a toffee edge add extra flavors. Drink this wine from 2019."
Riesling,"A nicely balanced entry-level Riesling, with hints of stone fruit and wet stone accenting apple and citrus. As a Saar wine should be, it's properly light on its feet, with refreshing acids on the abbreviated finish. Drink now and over the next few years."
Riesling,"Sunny tangerine acidity highlights the rounded, slightly creamy mouthfeel of this light-bodied dry Riesling. Bright grapefruit and quince flavors are forward and fresh, offset by stony mineral tones that linger on the finish. It's a delicate yet richly balanced wine to enjoy now though 2025."
Riesling,"Whiffs of petrol, herb and spice lend savory tones to a palate that's chock full of pristinely ripe grapefruit, peach and nectarine flavors. It's dry in style, but richly textured on the palate, with generous acidity that reverberates on the finish."
Riesling,"A clear favorite in a lineup of 2013 late-harvest NY Rieslings, this lip smackingly unctuous wine calibrates sweet, luscious fruit against layers and layers of spicy, saffron complexities. Honey-dipped grapefruit and melon flavors are rich and opulent, yet not at all cloying. It's a bracing, zesty wine that's delicious sip after long sip."
Riesling,"This steely, mineral-driven wine is crisp with an austere edge. The fruit is ripe, while taut and tense at the same time. As it ages, the wine will show rich peach and apricot flavors to round it out. Age for four years and more. Screwcap."
Riesling,"Quite quinine and focused on the nose, underripe peach tones linger underneath. The well-balanced palate plays between juicy peach and shocks of lime, leading to a talc-dusted finish."
Riesling,"Off-dry and stainless steel fermented, it carries some volatile scents in the nose. Bubble gum and candied orange flavors quickly turn bitter as the wine flattens out in the mouth."
Riesling,The bracing freshness of green pear peel mixed with lemon freshness soon yields to a softer fruit note on the nose. Some creamy midpalate texture lends extra weight to this slender wine that charms effortlessly with lemony verve.
Riesling,"This aged Riesling is medium gold colored, with pleasant aromas of lemon peel and petrol. It is round and generous on the palate, with flavors of lemon custard and green olive tapenade. The finish is long, with lingering flavors of lemon pith."
Riesling,"The deliciously tart notes of Cox Orange Pippin apples are heightened by lemon brightness. The palate shimmers with peach but zesty lemon keeps the upper hand in this concentrated, ripe but linear Riesling. The finish is just a little hot."
Riesling,"Delicate blossom and fresh apple notes are pretty on the nose. The palate is a bit bracing by comparison, offering tart lemon-lime flavors and a touch of earthiness on the finish. Drink now."
Riesling,"There's a chalky baking soda touch to the nose of this bottling, with touches of key lime, ripe tangerine and orange blossom. The palate is tangy and grippy in chalky texture, with citrus peel flavors. Very fresh and almost entirely dry."
Riesling,"Aromas of Bosc pear, apple, diesel and apricot lead to elegant fruit flavors. It drinks just a hair off dry. The concentration seems a bit wanting but what's there is well balanced."
Riesling,"Dusty mineral and bramble notes lend a savory, slightly rustic feel to this dry-style Riesling. It's delicate in body and concentration, but refreshing and zesty with lime acidity."
Riesling,"This fits the mold of Clare Valley Riesling perfectly. Struck flint notes give way to bright citrus on the nose, followed up by pineapple, cardamom and cinnamon flavors. It's dry to the point of austerity, framed by a slightly dusty texture, yet boasts mouthwatering acids on the long finish. Drink now–2025, possibly longer."
Riesling,Flinty highlights join lemon zest freshness on a thrillingly pure and streamlined palate bursting with lemon and tangerine zest. This is taut and slender but packs a citrus punch. This is destined for hot days; it is lovely now but will also last. Some spritz enlivens the finish. Drink Now till 2020.
Riesling,"Nikolaihof's biodynamic viticulture shows through in the sheer purity of fruit in this wine. It tastes so fresh and crisp, offering a vivacious, lively series of floral flavors, crispened by intense acidity. The finish peels back the apple skin texture, leaving a delicious, clean mouthfeel."
Riesling,"This powerful expression of Riesling blends floral aromas with scents of lime, pineapple and crushed stone, then finishes with great length and intensity. The strident citrus and mineral notes seem to echo on the palate, filling the mouth with their characterful flavors."
Riesling,"This is a veritable bargain for the incredible quality it delivers. It's lavishly composed, with a flurry of floral, fruity attributes—cherry blossoms, sweet peaches, and yellow plums—all kissed with honey, and a shower of lemon-lime acidity. Enjoy now for its youthful exuberance, but put a few away to see its honeyed tones darken and mature over the next decade."
Riesling,"A straightforward, modern dry Riesling, this wine shows a slight hint of gasoline, citrus blossoms, wet river stones and apple skin on the nose. The mouthfeel is more full than Mike Callahan's other bottlings, with waxy citrus skins, lime pith, sour apple, alkaline elements and a touch of white jasmine."
Riesling,"Lemony lightness, coupled with zesty spritz on the palate make this a refreshing white with lots of focus, linearity and whistle-clean length. Floral notes around the edges add to the intrigue."
Riesling,"There's a hint of smoke throughout the nose and palate that adds a layer of complexity to this sweet, pretty Riesling. Aromas of honeysuckle blossoms combine with the freshness of pressed apples and a bright, high-toned acidity. Smoke, slate and stone kick in to create a long, elegant finish. Overall, a well balanced, enjoyable wine."
Riesling,"Glints of ripe yellow plum lend a mellow air to this streamlined, fresh and citrus-clean wine. A concentrated core gains texture from pithy grapefruit notes. It's a clean, harmoniously balanced wine with staying power. Drink now until 2025."
Riesling,"Lemon pith and ripe peach aromas are clouded under a distinctly medicinal tone of baby aspirin. While there is nice roundness to the palate and balanced acidity to boot, the flavors are mild showings of orchard fruit and lemon curd."
Riesling,"Perfumed notes of raspberry and pink grapefruit distinguish this delicately framed single-vineyard designate from Keuka Spring's regular-label Riesling. Briskly textured yet lusciously peachy, it lingers long on a streak of lemon-lime acidity. Drink now through 2021 to maximize its fruity freshness."
Riesling,"A rounded style of wine, its texture full of warm fruits, pear, apricot and some lime juice to give a fresh edge. It is full of flavor, with apples and cream flavors, layered with crisp, tight acidity, but all within the context of a full, dense wine. Glass stopper."
Riesling,"Golden liquid, a piercing nose, utter musk: these are the first impressions of this fragrant, botrytised win. A topnote of candied lemon hovers above the core flavor of beeswax, while bright, juicily luscious acidity makes the mouth water. This is a concentrated high-wire act, dancing between bundled sweetness and the piercing, enlivening freshness of Riesling acidity. Nothing is cloying; everything bathes in the freshness of the balancing acidity that sharpens the flavors. It's gorgous now, but will last well through 2040."
Riesling,"Marlargo appears to be a reasonably successful attempt at fashioning a pan-Australian brand, sourcing fruit from different parts of the country. This Clare Riesling starts with scents of talcum powder and lime sherbet, then follows those up with similar flavors. It's muscular and taut, even a bit austere, clocking in at only 11.4% alcohol. May develop through 2015."
Riesling,"A sinewy wine that begins with ginger, lemon curd and white peach that give way to a slightly watery palate with a silky texture and good acidity to balance the substantial residual sugar. The short-to-medium finish ends on a candied ginger note. Drink now."
Riesling,"Stunningly good, this offers off-dry numbers (13g/L) but plenty of high acid tang. Honeysuckle, tart citrus, green apple and honeycomb start it out, and the wine kicks into more and more gears with superb concentration and depth. Lemon verbena and lemon-tea flavors come into the extended finish, with light tannins and superb details. Drink now through 2035."
Riesling,"A standout amidst a stellar lineup of 2013 Rheingau auslese, this deeply concentrated, complex Riesling is a kaleidescope of sensory offerings. Pretty white floral notes perfume swathes of marmalade and crushed minerals. It's unctuous yet spine tingling, lithe yet endlessly penetrating on the finish."
Riesling,"Plump and slightly sweet, this late-harvest Riesling comes in at 10% alcohol—something along the lines of a rich spätlese in terms of its alcohol-acid-sugar balance. Notes of pineapple and crushed stone open up to melon fruit on the palate and finish long, with a bit of cinnamon or ginger spice."
Riesling,"Aromatic notes of orange peel and flesh charm on the nose of this wine. The palate is gentle, dry and fresh, with a super-clean finish offering apple and grapefruit."
Riesling,"Electric acidity sends a thunderbolt through this bright, concentrated Riesling full of stone fruit and tangerine flavors. Dry and lithe, it finishes with puckery flair and a lingering sheen of honeycomb. Drink now."
Riesling,"There's a brooding quality to the smoky, diesel-fuel like aromas of this wine, but that's left in the rearview by ripe flavors of honey and baked apple once it's in the mouth. This wine is round and atypically soft for the vintage, but picks up some lively lime notes on the finish."
Riesling,"Zesty lime cuts razor-sharp edges into this buoyant, fruity Riesling full of white peach, apple and honeysuckle notes. Delicately honeyed, it's piercing yet lip-smackingly juicy, finishing on a lingering spray of green florals. It's an elegant, tightly structured wine that's stunning now but will hold nicely through 2020."
Riesling,"Intense aromas of dried orange peel, tangerine and spice entice from this silky-smooth wine. It's deeply mineral, yet lusciously fruity, loaded with ripe, sweet yellow-cherry and berry flavors. Finishes with a honeyed cling."
Riesling,"This seems prematurely evolved with its lifted, kerosene-like whiff on the nose, but is no less pleasant for that. Ripe stone fruit melds into a slick, oily palate guided by a seam of bright, lemony freshness. The finish is dry and bright, and flavors fill the mouth long after the last sip."
Riesling,"Elegant peach and floral tones on this off-dry Riesling build in complexity on the nose and palate, with layers of waxy lanolin and fresh green herbs. It's forward and fruity, yet honed and balanced, with bright lemon-lime acidity."
Riesling,"Scents of tangerine peel and lanolin add a spicy complexity to intensely fruity, sweet peach and nectarine flavors on this gorgeously honeyed, yet easy-drinking Riesling. Striking lemon acidity and crushed stone notes add delicacy and nuance to the finish."
Riesling,"Tantalizing spice notes mix with aromas of quince and lanolin on this fabulous bargain Riesling. While intensely tropical on the palate, it's remarkably nuanced with hints of potpourri, white flowers, and a sharp, steely acidity. Perfect as an aperitif, or paired with spicy, herbaceous Asian cuisine."
Riesling,"Bright, appley aromas and ripe apple and peach flavors make this light-bodied wine fresh and appealing. It tastes slightly off dry, with an engagingly smooth texture."
Riesling,"Off-dry and minty, with a strong streak of wintergreen, this simple, fruity Riesling offers fruit flavors of green apple and a bit of waxy lemon."
Riesling,"Scents of fresh apple and pear are accented with touches of wax and mineral on this nuanced, dry Riesling. The palate feels lush and fruity with ripe peach and pear flavors, but zesty lime acidity and a shower of minerality lend stately elegance. A surprisingly bold wine for a diminutive price. Drink now."
Riesling,"Hints of sea salt and crushed stone add layers of minerality to this Riesling that's just a shade off-dry. The palate is concentrated with notes of tangerine juice, lemon peel and pressed apples, balanced by puckery lemon acidity."
Riesling,"With a palate-drenching fountain of peach nectar, grapefruit and orange blossom notes, this Finger Lakes standard packs a surprising punch in the 2014 vintage. Dry, yet intensely ripe, it boasts long, lingering streaks of honey and fruit offset by zigzagging daggers of lime zest and lemon. It's penetrating and deliciously persistent."
Riesling,Blossom and citrus inform the nose—white jasmine hovers alongside grapefruit and orange. The palate is juicy and full of bouncy easy fruit on a fluid dryish body. Bright lemon freshness makes the fruit flavors even more vivid. The balance between fruit and freshness gives this tension and makes it very moreish. The finish is clean and orange scented.
Riesling,"This is a über aromatic wine with a long list of notes that include orange marmalade, peach, citrus, and drizzled honey. Harvested at 42 brix and retaining a whopping 240 g/L residual sugar, it's supremely rich and sweet with a lingering finish."
Riesling,"Tart pineapple and grapefruit tones contrast plump yellow cherry and peach flavors in this dry, nimble-footed Riesling. Zesty lime and mineral tones collide on the midpalate, lingering through a long, steely finish."
Riesling,"Sun-ripened apricot notes emanate from the glass, mingling with aromatic notions of ripe orange. On the precise palate, this beguiling fruit is joined by subtle, lifted hints of citrus foliage and zest. This is a wonderfully slender but profound wine, showing Riesling from its most charming bewitching side."
Riesling,"This attractive, medium-sweet Riesling keeps the alcohol low. Generous apple and apricot fruit flavors make it a fine warm-weather sipper. Start out any picnic with a chilled bottle of this bright and vividly fruity wine, and you're on the right track."
Riesling,"Schiefer means “slate,” but this wine's stoniness is softer, less severe than that, cushioned under layers of superripe pear and spices that resemble cinnamon or clove and ginger. There's ample weight and richness on the palate despite a sense of dryness, and the wine finishes long, with hints of ripe peach."
Riesling,"Restrained but earthy notes of lemon zest play against slight, flinty smoke. This is still rather closed but the still-dormant expanse of ripe fruit is evident on the palate. The zesty lemon core takes turns with yeasty richness to dazzle. Wonderfully long."
Riesling,"Fresh, fragrant peaches are dusted with minerals on this deeply aromatic, intensely floral wine. Off dry in style and opulent in mouthfeel, it's balanced by a honed, steely minerality. It makes an impressive buy for a diminutive price."
Riesling,"Overtones of candied lemon peel steal into the more general fresh zestiness here, hinting at aromatic richness and purity. The palpable, zesty midpalate highlights the citrus qualities even more. Verve and freshness in a glass."
Riesling,"Vibrant and fresh with hints of apple, green herbs and blossoms, this off-dry wine boasts a plush, juicy palate full of white peach and lime flavors. It's anchored by a clean line of steely minerality that lingers elegantly."
Riesling,"The aromas are vibrant, with notes of flowers, jasmine, lime and peach. The palate drinks a hair off dry, with the concentration coming off as light but still providing interest."
Riesling,"Quite distinct from its Single Wheel companion bottlings, there's a rustic, slightly savory tone to pressed apple and pear flavors in this off-dry Riesling. It's light bodied and spry with a brisk, lemony finish."
Riesling,"Swirls of penetrating peach and honey flavors pack a mighty punch in this dazzling, sunny sip. Off dry in style, it's an easy going yet elegant wine accented by saffron, blossoms and reverberating tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2017."
Riesling,"Dry, bold and intensely mineral, this powerful Riesling is lifted by whiffs of lemongrass and mint, along with a shining streak of lemon acidity. It finishes with a bristle of lime zest astringency and a hint of white flower."
Riesling,"No doubt on the sweet side for a trocken (or maybe just with relatively low acidity), this is medium bodied, with aromas and flavors reminiscent of crushed stone, orange blossom and peach. Drink it over the next several years."
Riesling,"Comes close to a Germanic style, with tight, lean citrusy aromas and flavors balanced by green apples and pears. It's light and refreshing, never heavy or ponderous. Finishes long and tart, full of fresh limes, with just a pinch of sugar for balance."
Riesling,"Pressed apple and pears seem to be dusted in pollen and saffron on the nose of this savory, spicy Riesling. It's off dry and delicate in style, but concentrated in lip smacking tangerine and lime flavors. Dusty, earthy tones persist through the moderately long finish."
Riesling,"Tropical melon and mango notes are wild and effusive on the nose, striking a contrast to a palate that's surprisingly smoky and mineral. Vivacious and zesty on the palate, it's a uniquely composed, enjoyable wine."
Riesling,"An unfinished masterpiece, still dominated by youthful yeasty flavors, ripe with white peaches, pears and a crisp pink grapefruit element. The wine has minerality, but the juiciness is still to happen. Three to 4 years at least."
Riesling,"The aromas are surprisingly light considering the variety, with whiffs of both lime and peach. It drinks dry, with the variety difficult to discern."
Riesling,"Baked Cox apples with lemon juice are evoked by the fresh and appetizing nose on this wine. These flavors continue on the dry, juicy and refreshing palate, gathering hints of honey and cinnamon. Lithe and dry but full flavored, it finishes with pure lemon."
Riesling,"Inviting layered aromas of ripe stone fruit, hints of citrus and some earthy spice and minerality. Crisp and refreshing. Very good depth and intensity of lively youthful fruit with a strong mineral core adding complexity. Medium sweet and balanced with a long finish."
Riesling,"A tropical hint of passion fruit hits the nose before more definite notions of tart apple and citrus appear. There is concentration on the midpalate and lots of freshness, with a clean, dry finish."
Riesling,"Blocky and tart, this shows little of the flower or delicate citrus notes that many Oregon Rieslings convey. The clean apple flavor makes it good for summer picnics."
Riesling,"Delicate notes of waxy lemon peel and apple waft from this light-footed spätlese. Its honeyed sweetness penetrates to the core, accenting flavors of pressed apple and pear. The finish is zesty and spry, leaving only a hint of black-tea tannins."
Riesling,"From cool, high-altitude vines, this Riesling is aromatic and crisp with a hint of steel and plenty of freshness. Acidity cuts through this already delicious, very fruity wine that is about to move to maturity. Drink now."
Riesling,"Done in a medium-dry style, this shows petrol, lime pith, lime blossoms and wet cement on the nose. The palate is rich with squeezed lemon juice, shaved citrus ice, ripe pears and a stony grip that holds it all together."
Riesling,"While intensely mineral and strikingly brisk with acidity, this delicate dry Riesing also boasts pretty notes of blossom, white peach and pear. It's a keenly four-square wine that's zingy, fresh and endlessly quaffable."
Riesling,"Fragrant white florals and concentrated flavors of juicy pink pomelo are effortlessly decadent on this semidry Riesling. While soft and supple on entry, there's a nervy edge of Meyer lemon pith accentuated by a long, mineral-laced finish."
Riesling,"Starts off with some intriguing notes of musk and spice, the turns intensely sweet, with powerful honey and orange marmalade flavors that coat the mouth and refuse to leave. There's just too much sugar in the end, and not enough acid or minerality to provide the ideal balance. Still, it is impressive, and if you measure pleasure solely by grams per liter of residual sugar, this will surely strike gold."
Riesling,"Mineral intensity and concentrated primary fruit marry beautifully in this dry, elegantly composed Riesling. Crisp yellow cherry and grapefruit flavors are mouthwatering and lush, yet shaded by streaks of stone and dusty, slightly bitter minerals. Lime acidity extends a steady finish. It drinks beautifully now, but will be delightful for the next decade, at least."
Riesling,"Smoke and the merest, tantalizing whiff of toffee apple can be discerned on the nose. Fragrant herbs—think chervil and yarrow—also make an appearance. The palate is dry but brims with ripe lemon oil and fresh lemon fruit. This is streamlined and impactful, with a commanding, overarching freshness that only enforces the inherent power of this site more. For now this is tightly wound and still closed, majoring on its ample lemon charm but this needs bottle age to let the myriad notes promised on the nose unfold on the palate. Drink 2022–2040."
Riesling,"Subtle lemon and apple on the nose belie the intense peachiness that awaits on the palate of this fruity dry Riesling. It's a shade rounder and richer on the palate than most Finger Lakes Rieslings from this vintage, but keenly balanced, finishing on a bracing lemon-lime note."
Riesling,"Fresh yellow peaches seem to be layered in honey and pollen throughout this lusciously sweet, lip-smacking Riesling. The midpalate bristles with acidity, but it's harmoniously balanced, bursting of fresh apples and lemons. The finish is elegant and long, laced in soft tea tannins."
Riesling,"Scents of lemon wax and a slightly spritzy mouthfeel are followed by somewhat surprisingly sweet fruit for a wine labeled dry. The flavors favor orange juice and orange candy. If you like a fairly heavy, fruit-forward style, this is just right."
Riesling,"Incredibly ripe and sweet apricots, candied orange peel, a touch of fresh spearmint and fresh lemon zest all abound on the nose, and are just the first expressions. Balm-like sweetness and clouds of more apricot and peach play on the palate, but electric acidity runs straight through and lends this rich and unctuous TBA the thrilling freshness and streamlined zestiness of candied citrus peel, finishing with long, lip-smacking deliciousness. Unlike treacly sweet TBAs, this has exquisite freshness and is very enlivening, with real citrus lift. Drink from 2016."
Riesling,"This botrytis-affected Riesling is dark and unctuous, with a nutty stone-fruit aroma and a petrol-like accent. The feel is tight like Sherry, while the flavors of citrus peel, cinnamon and resin lead to a creamy, sticky finish that comes with some heat."
Riesling,"Though not labeled as such, this thrilling Riesling comes from the Ancient Lakes appellation and brings aromatic notes of peach, orange blossom and pear. It drinks medium-sweet with abundant stone fruit flavors."
Riesling,"While more mineral than fruit-forward on the nose, this pretty, dry Riesling is quite yielding, suggesting ripe, rich pink grapefruit and white peach on the palate. It's feather light but silky in texture, balanced by a strike of lemon acidity that lingers on the finish."
Riesling,"This medium-bodied Riesling comes across as a bit rich and oily for the kabinett prädikat, but it still offers enjoyable drinking. Hints of dried apricot and orange marmalade shade the aromas, while the flavors are of honeyed stone fruit with some underlying petrol. Finishes clean and minerally."
Riesling,"Wedge Mountain makes a Riesling that is as bone dry as any Riesling can possibly be. It's consistent, and styled for slurping with fresh oysters more than anything. Mouth-puckering acidity, lean citrus fruits and a lingering sense of sucking on a ripe lemon."
Riesling,"A bit of apple, a bit of citrus, a bit of toast—things are just hinted at in this frothy sparkler which would make an ideal, dry-finishing but lively party wine."
Riesling,"Candle wax and pollen notes lend a slightly earthy tone to fresh lemon and lime in this off-dry Riesling. Crisp and citrusy, it finishes briskly with bracing darts of lime zest and cocktail bitters."
Riesling,"Made in a late harvest, sweet style, this has good dimension and intensity with layers of stone fruit, honey and spring flowers. The wine is bursting with exotic fruit and is sweet and chewy in feel."
Riesling,"Fresh apricot and peach juxtapose more savory tones of bramble and hay in this light-bodied dry Riesling. The palate is briskly concentrated, finishing on a bright streak of sunny tangerine acidity."
Riesling,"On the rich side, this is a ripe and fruity wine. Its mineral texture is comfortably cushioned within an aromatic white fruit character that adds juicy acidity to the mix. It's a delicious wine that could age a few months more."
Riesling,"Ripe on the attack, with flavors of fleshy, yellow stone fruit and marmalade, this voluptuous yet dry Riesling is balanced, with layers of crushed stone and slate-driven minerality. Tart, citrusy acidity sends a sunny shockwave to your senses."
Riesling,"Very ripe aspects inform the nose: ripe honeyed peach and pear dominate. The palate, on the other hand, is a picture of citric slenderness and steely concentration of freshness. Its absolute dryness highlights the brisk, clean and lemon-driven style perfectly. This is wonderfully bracing and cleansing and so very refreshing. Lovely now but sure to develope. Drink now through 2025."
Riesling,The glorious aromatics of the ripest oranges play on the nose. There even is a slight hint of candied peel. The palate is opulent with fruit expression but held in check by lovely ripe lemon freshness. The palate is concentrated and has lots of energetic direction. An earthy edge grounds things beautifully. Lasting and lovely.
Riesling,"Lines of dusty chalk lend an elegant mineral vibe to this richly fruity, blossomy wine. The palate is luscious and ripe, boasting dense white peach and apricot flavors, but anchored by a zesty backbone of acidity. It's fruit-forward and accessible, yet remarkably elegant."
Riesling,"Whiffs of candle wax and crushed minerals lend depth to the concentrated tangerine and honey flavors in this sun-kissed, citrusy kabinett. It's forward and fruity yet zippy and fresh, showing balanced acidity and a cool, mineral finish."
Riesling,"Very light and slightly sweet in style, this low-alcohol bottling offers stone fruit, lemon juice and peels, and the slightest hint of petrol on the honeyed nose. Exceedingly bright and crisp on the palate, the peachy sweetness is cut by a nearly bubbly acidity. It would be great for pool parties."
Riesling,"Orange marmalade and sweet acidity mark this as a particularly rich style of Beerenauslese. The botrytis is intense, but even this cannot overwhelm the great sweetness and richness."
Riesling,"This is done in a soft, loose-knit, wide-open style—not the usual crisp and racy Riesling found in the Northwest. Apple and orange fruits are accented with notes of cracker and grain. It feels a bit flat in the finish. Drink up."
Riesling,"Delightful peachy notes define the fruity friendly nose. The palate adds zesty lemon to this rich fruit to create one of those dramatic and moreish Rieslings that teeter enticingly on the brink of peachy richness and citrus tang. The palate is slender, light footed and dry, the finish is whistle clean and wonderfully appetizing."
Riesling,"Whiffs of zesty lemon and fresh herbs lend vitality to rich, honeyed peach flavors on this unabashedly juicy, semi-dry Kabinett. An ideal late-summer apéritif at an excellent price, it finishes with a bracing shower of jasmine tea and lime acidity."
Riesling,"Riper, and more lusciously peachy and floral than the Herrenberg, the Abtsberg Superior calibrates honeyed stone fruit flavors against a spine of tart, tangerine acidity. Light-footed and harmoniously off dry, it finishes long with spicy mineral flair. Drinks well now but should continue to improve through at least 2025."
Riesling,"Continuing a long-running streak of excellence, the latest vintage of Eroica blends fruit from vineyards in the Lake Chelan, Yakima Valley, Royal Slope and Horse Heaven Hills regions. It's a rich mix of peach and papaya, creamy and slightly sweet (16.6 g/L). The citrusy acids keep a fine edge on the lush flavors."
Riesling,"Dusty, saffron-spiced earthiness is juxtaposed against intense mango and tangerine fruitiness in this deeply complex wine. It's unctuously sweet, but balanced by a piercing streak of acidity that penetrates through the midpalate. Spry and silken, it finishes on a long lingering whisper of honey and peach."
Riesling,"This bone-dry, steely-textured wine is crisp and bracing due to firm acidity, fruity-but-not-sweet flavors and maybe a touch of tannin that adds to the firm mouthfeel. Like a squeeze of lemon on the pan-roasted fish, it will make a great counterpoint to lots of things on the menu."
Riesling,"A beautifully perfumed wine is give shape by its great swathe of minerality, its intense acidity. The fruits range from citrus to white peach, a gallery of delicious flavor. Like any great Riesling, it needs years to mature."

Riesling,"Honeyed marmalade and bitter orange-rind flavors are a counterplay of silky-sweet and astringent elements on this dry, but densely textured wine. Full bodied in style, it's balanced with piercing lemon-lime acidity, with a murmur of slate-like minerality through the finish."

Riesling,"The aromas of this jazzy wine disclose lime leaf, white peach and slate. The off-dry flavors of flowers, pear and stone fruit are typical of Washington in their intensity and detail."
Riesling,"Bright, almost luminous Meyer lemon and orange hover like a halo. The palate intensifies this ripe but zesty purity even more. The fruit is pulled into lemony focus at the concentrated core of this sleek, moreish Viennese original."
Riesling,"Orange rind and exotic spices lend a mysterious appeal to ripe, rich flavors of melon, mango and peach on this intoxicating, unctuous Riesling. It's sunny and sweet on the palate, but tart tangerine acidity makes it refreshingly thirst quenching."
Riesling,"A steely edge sharpens this perfumed, blossomy Riesling full of ripe white peach and apricot flavors. Dry in style, it's rich and weighty on the palate with a penetrating, powerful finish. Drinks beautifully now, but likely to improve through at least 2021."
Riesling,"Slate and struck flint provide a mineral-intense backdrop to pristine white grapefruit and pear flavors in this off-dry Riesling. It's just a shade off dry, with a silken, supple mouthfeel that's delightful. Drinks beautifully now but will continue to improve through 2020."

Riesling,"A warm amber color and intense, concentrated honey and toasted-nut aromas are followed by a supple, soft texture and mouthcoating flavors of sweet apricot and baked peaches. This will be fantastic as a dessert in itself, or with some less-sweet cookies or sautéed almonds."
Riesling,"Voluptuous notions of orange oil segue into a more earthy notion of lemon-anointed autumn leaves. Lots goes on here: the fresh peel of rosy apples, grated lemon zest and wet earth, all combined on a very smooth palate. This is highly drinkable and full of moreish allure."
Riesling,"While demure on the nose with just hints of yellow peach and spice, this dry, medium-bodied Riesling builds in intensity on the palate with concentrated flavors of tangerine and yellow cherry. A streak of lemon-lime acidity stretches out the finish."
Riesling,"Petrol and citrus aromas and flavors merge seamlessly in this medium-bodied dry Riesling. It seems atypically round for such a young Eden Valley Riesling, so maybe not a long-term proposition, but it goes down easily now, with a long, slightly oily finish."
Riesling,"So lusciously ripe, with notes of mango and guava, this is an explosion of sweet fruit, honey and flowers. Searing citrus acidity cuts through the palate, highlighting layers of crushed stone and tea leaf that add complexity. It's so exquisitely delicate, but lingers endlessly on the finish."
Riesling,"Sunny and ripe on the nose, with whiffs of honey, orange rind and yellow raisin, this dry, full-bodied wine is textured and broad.

Riesling,"While the nose is subdued, lush honeydew and white peach flavors shine brilliantly on the palate of this taut, nervous wine.

Riesling,"This is a wine that is so young. It is aromatic, fruity and still settling together in its potential concentration and structure. Look forward to a wine that has pear fruits, a tight, mineral character, and structure. Look forward to an impressive and serious future. Drink from 2016."

Riesling,"This stunning TBA is a powerhouse of superripe peach, mango and orange flavors. The palate feels smooth and rich, with honey and marmalade flavors, but it's ethereally light, with a dusty minerality and shrieking lemon acidity that reverberates on the finish. Gorgeous now, but should develop an earthy, honeyed intensity over the next decade."
Riesling,"Something floral and stony appears on the nose, along with a hint of smoke and something uncompromising and hard. The palate then packs a real punch: the wine hits you like a bullet of concentrated freshness and citric verve.

Totally lip-smacking. Drink now through 2027."

Riesling,"For a Pauly Bergweiler wine, this is atypically minerally, as its wines have tended toward the lush, fruity side of the spectrum over recent years. Petrol and slate aromas lead into a wine that's round in the mouth but relatively dry in style, with good length and minerality on the finish."
Riesling,"A saline edge offsets crisp yellow peach and starfruit flavors in this zesty dry Riesling. It's spry and fruity, yet elegant, finishing with surprising persistence."

Riesling,"Fresh notes of ripe lemon zest are suffused with hay flower and earth notes. The palate majors on zesty, lively and aromatic citrus: tangerine and Amalfi lemon above all. This is dry and bright, slender and precise, yet never lets go of its earthy touch. The finish is expansive and clean."
Riesling,"Dried apricot notes dominate this wine from start to finish, making it a bit one-dimensional. Still, it features impressive sugar-acid balance so despite the sweetness it's not cloying; finishes long, with lipsmacking notes of honeyed pineapple. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC."
Riesling,"A fragrant and pure nose of slightly floral tangerine peel opens this wine. It offers a ripe fruit-driven dance of aromas and freshness—think tangerine, ripe lemon, crisp apple and a beguiling floral dimension.

Riesling,"There's a tinge of caramelized sugar amid ripe yellow peach and apricots in this ripe, yet deftly balanced Riesling. Off dry in style, it has a strike of lemon-lime acidity that jolts the palate from its juicy, fruity ease. It's quaffable but equally penetrating."

It's an elegant, stately wine to drink now through 2023."

Riesling,"Peach and tangerine unite to create an utterly seductive nose: luscious juicy flesh is defined by aromatic spice and zestiness. These opposites play off each other and create something that is alive and vigorous, joyful and precious. There is concentration and poise, structure and texture, but none of this concerns the hedonistic forces at play. They just want to express their careless exuberance. There is something defiant about this dry concentrated wine. Perhaps it is a welcome and encouraging counterweight to so much sadness in the world."

Riesling,"The green apple, apple skin and flower aromas pop. The off-dry peach flavors keep you coming back for more."

Riesling,"Soft notes of blossom and apricot strike a gentle tone in this wine, with hints of ripe, juicy apple on the dry but wonderfully aromatic palate.

Riesling,"From a different block of the same vineyard as the “Whale label” Memorista, this is drinking much better at the moment. It's smooth and supple—a pretty wine with honeyed minerality around fruit flavors of citrus and peaches."
Riesling,"This is a prototypical Saar Riesling, with classic green apple and citrus flavors underscored by slate-driven minerality that lingers for a long time on the finish. Despite the sensation of plumpness, the wine is light on its feet. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC."
Riesling,"Fairly dry in style, with apple and pear flavors that are ripe without being sweet, and brought home by steely acids and tart citrus fruit. Drink this medium-bodied Riesling over the next year or two."
Riesling,"After starting out a touch reduced, this wine opens to reveal aromas of wet rock, high-toned white flowers, lime and green apple. The palate is broad and dry, with generous citrus flavors that linger."
Riesling,"A salty tang of mineral and lime refreshes this intensely citrusy yet easy-drinking Riesling. It's pleasantly off-dry in style, softening sharp white-grapefruit flavor with a lingering caress of honey. Drink now."
Riesling,"It's hard to choose a favorite amidst Wiemer's 2012 lineup, but this one is a strong contender. It's brisk, yet intensely penetrating on the nose and palate, with a luscious, juicy palate full of sweet white peach and mango flavors. Zesty lemon-lime acidity and a crush of minerals linger on the finish. It's a complex yet effortlessly enjoyable medium-sweet Riesling to savor now, or through 2021–2024."
Riesling,"Scents of waxy lemon peels and candles meld with delicate peach on this refreshing off-dry Riesling. On the palate, hints of lemon verbena and lime zest lend a herbal tone that highlights the wine's revitalizing lime-juice finish."
Riesling,"Penetrating strikes of honey, peach and chamomile charge through this light-footed yet powerful Kabinett. It's blossomy and perfumed from start to finish, lifted by a dazzling spray of lemon-lime acidity and lacy filigreed sweetness. A lovely wine to drink now, but will hold nicely, if not improve, until 2020."
Riesling,"Even Weinbach's simplest Rieslings are full of intense flavors. This wine is floral, with flavors of white fruits along with a racy, crisp acidity. It is complex, concentrated but essentially dry."
Riesling,"Fresh and zesty, with wet stones and talcum powder upfront, followed by apple and gardenia in the mouth. It's light-bodied and slightly off-dry with a short-to-medium finish redolent of white flowers. Drink now."
Riesling,"An earthy hint comes with the bright lemon flavors of this dry, tart wine. The palate reveals a glimpse of riper fruit but lime freshness rules. It finishes totally clean."
Riesling,"Scents of honey and freshly pressed apples waft from this delicate sweet Riesling. Bright, sunny peach flavor dominates the palate, but is pierced with a startling vein of lemon acidity. Finishes a savory with lingering notes of pollen and spice."
Riesling,"Intense stone-fruit and honeysuckle notes merge seamlessly with hints of smoke and crushed stone. While ripe and rich, it's also penetratingly dry, with juicy fruit flavors. It's gorgeously composed with striking lime-juice acidity and a savory, minerally tone that lingers."
Riesling,"This is a firm, almost fleshy style, with solid peach fruit and highlights of grapefruit pith and rind. It emphasizes fruit over flower, and finishes quite dry."
Riesling,"Piercing lemon-lime acidity cuts a razor's edge through this dense, mouthfilling wine. Dry in style, it's a showcase of minerality rather than overt fruit flavors, finishing long on a breathless flurry of orange blossom."
Riesling,"Savory tones of saffron and pollen permeate through this brisk, dry Riesling. Hints of white blossoms and lemon brighten the midpalate, leading a crisp, clean finish. Enjoy young."
Riesling,"Dr. Loosen offers a solid value in this remarkably well-priced eiswein. It's enticing on the nose, with aromas of honey, saffron and a dark, dusty mineral tone. Rich and silky in texture, it's concentrated and lively on the palate, with intense flavors of lemon and peach. Finishes with a tinge of tea and spicy orange rind. It's delicious now, but should develop well through 2020."
Riesling,"Intense minerality penetrates through the nose and palate of this dry, remarkably bold Riesling, highlighting notes of fresh pineapple and white grapefruit. The mouthfeel is creamy and viscous, but bitter lemon pith and herb notes lend balance and complexity. Drink now through 2016."
Riesling,"A plump, amply concentrated Riesling, with plenty of pineapple fruit to balance the hints of kerosene, slate and lime. Finishes crisp and clean, with a dry quality that invites another sip. Drink now."
Riesling,"Light in body, yet sinewy in texture and a bit sweet, This Riesling has turned out well. Floral, green apple and lime aromas and flavors are almost Mosel-like, but the wine is richer and weightier than that, clocking in at 10% alcohol."
Riesling,"Smoke and mineral oil tones add layers of depth to the pretty white blossom, peach and tangerine notes on this crisp, nervy Riesling. Mouthwateringly tangy with a delicious note of Sour Patch candy on the finish."
Riesling,"With quite a bit of residual sugar, this Riesling is sweet, but balanced with crisp acidity that makes it clean and zesty. The flavors are of peaches, apricots, candied ginger, honeysuckle and vanilla. Low alcohol makes it easy to drink."
Riesling,"Spine tingling grapefruit acidity adds edge to this otherwise plump, juicy semi-dry Riesling. Sunny yellow plum and tangerine flavors are sunny but fresh, wrapping up briskly on the finish. Drink now through 2019."
Riesling,"Rich, ripe yellow peach and mango flavors are deeply concentrated in this fruity, off-dry wine. It's plush and delectably juicy, but clean lines of steel and lime lend balance and vibe."
Riesling,"A ripe, rich and fruity wine, this also has a sense of depth and structure. The palate boasts flavors of apricots, citrus and crisp apples. It's delicious now, but could also improve further after five years. Screwcap."
Riesling,"A clean aspect shines through this wine that offers all the freshness of green and yellow citrus along with a herbal glint, perhaps of citrus foliage. This is concentrated and comes with disarming purity and freshness that's wonderfully precise and dry."
Riesling,"A very fresh nose of slight citrus leads to an equally light, slightly lemon-scented palate of ultralight dimensions. There is a hint of riper fruit on the midpalate, but this is simple, refreshing and clean."
Riesling,"An almost buttery aroma and attractive peach, apricot and honey flavors give this dry, light-bodied wine a lot of personality. Nicely balanced, and smooth on the palate, it keeps unfolding more flavor nuances as it breathes."
Riesling,"While the nose is shy at first, the palate reveals abundant red and green apples, with some juicy yellow pear around the edges. Texture and structure strike a balance with the lovely, clean fruit. It's a delicious, textured, earthy Riesling made for food."
Riesling,"Dried oregano and sage notes lend a dusty, savory tone to the nose of this racy, light-bodied kabinett. The palate, by contrast, surprises with layers of lush, ripe tropical fruit cut with a razor's edge of acidity and lime zest. Finishes snappy and bright."
Riesling,"A lovely wine, teetering on the edge of sweetness. The pretty apple, apricot, and honeysuckle flavors have a crisp, steely edge of acidity, and there's a rich streak of mineral and diesel that adds complexity."
Riesling,"Crushed stone and fresh lemon persist from nose to finish on this revitalizing off-dry Riesling. It's brisk and thirst quenching, offering loads of crisp-tart peach and tangerine flavors. The finish is long and refreshingly citrusy."
Riesling,"Very sweet, this has honeyed-apricot, orange and vanilla flavors. It's an opulent wine, but as rich as it is, you find yourself wishing it were even sweeter."
Riesling,"Light and crisp, with a perfumed bouquet of baby powder and lime blossom. Simple green apple and lime flavors carry a tart edge through the finish."
Riesling,"Subtle and crisp in profile, this not-quite-dry Riesling from Lakewood Vineyards is delicate in its soft, slightly underripe peach and apricot tones. Vibrant acidity and a clean, floral spray on the finish make it wonderfully refreshing."
Riesling,"Exceptionally intense, this is a wine for real aficionados of Australian Riesling. Stone and gravel tango with aromas of lime juice and coconut, all of which is underscored by a firm minerality. Long, dry finish. Delicious. Try with pork in a mustard sauce."
Riesling,"Smoke tones blow off revealing layers of tropical fruit encased in wax and lanolin on this bold, nuanced wine. It's dry in style with a luscious, creamy texture cut with shards of acid and lime-zest astringency. Finishes long and lean."
Riesling,"Exuberantly floral, with notes of honeysuckle and orange blossom, yet not at all cloying or perfumy, this sparkler showcases all the delicacy and verve you expect from a Mosel Riesling. Softly effervescent, it's dry and spry on the palate, with an exceptionally long, peach-tinged finish."
Riesling,"So incredibly thick and sweet it's almost chewy in texture, with aromas and flavors that feature a fascinating interplay of fresh and dried apricots, peach and citrus, kept lively by healthy acidity. The finish lasts for minutes; the wine should age well for decades."
Riesling,"An attractive bouquet of pear, orange-lime and floral notes opens this easy, round white. There's a hint of mint and plenty of citrus on the palate, but the fruit is touch too sweet low acid and the mouthfeel a bit fat. Lacks the spine we'd like to see in a top Riesling."
Riesling,"Part of a single-vineyard library release, this affordable 21-year-old auslese offers a unique chance to taste through Riesling's longevity. Perceivable sweetness, along with fruit, has receded substantially, leaving an intensely mineral, almost saline wine in its place. Fresh lemony acidity persists, however, suggesting a glimmer of tart peach and apple flavors on the finish."
Riesling,"While effortlessly quaffable, this pretty, intensely floral off-dry Riesling also has a polished mineral tone throughout. Plush honeydew and yellow cherry notes are delicately sweet, offset by a revitalizing lime finish."
Riesling,"Freshly-pressed apples and pears are accented by hints of bramble and earth in this slightly savory dry Riesling. Zesty lemon-lime acidity adds brightness to a long, lingering finish. Drink now through 2019."
Riesling,"This is surprisingly plump and accessible, featuring scents of lime rind upfront, then flavors of apple, nectarine and citrus. A medium-bodied wine with a long, mouthwatering finish, it's a tasty near-term drinker but should develop well for up to 10 years."
Riesling,"The aromas leap out of the glass, with notes of fresh flowers, apricot and lime leaf. It drinks medium sweet with plentiful stone-fruit flavors."
Riesling,"Lush and already highly enjoyable, with a round, creamy texture and lingering finish. The aromas and flavors bring to mind dessert—ripe apple, honey and cinnamon—but the wine remains essentially dry."
Riesling,"Initial whiffs of spring ramps and dried herbs turn brighter and fresher with aeration on this light-bodied dry Riesling. Tasted quite young, it's a bit wild still with sharp, slightly jagged acidity juxtaposing bursts of pristine lemon and lime. Its tautness and savory complexities are attractive though, and likely to meld with maturity."
Riesling,"Ripe citrus notes appear immediately, recalling Amalfi lemon with rounder notions of tangerine and mandarine. The palate slims down to a light-footed, slender core of juicy, friendly and invigorating freshness. Streamlined and lemony, it evokes a citrusy brightness that seems almost cleansing."
Riesling,"Perfumed sprays of fresh green florals and crushed minerals lift this elegant off-dry Riesling. The palate is delicate and sprightly, full of zesty gooseberry and green plum flavors. An undertone of bramble lends a savoriness that lingers through the finish. Drink now through 2020."
Riesling,"Wonderfully fragrant and pretty, this delicately-made Riesling mixes candied pineapple, honeyed lemon, and pekoe tea flavors to good effect. It's a perfect late spring porch pounder."
Riesling,"From Trentino in northern Italy, this Riesling has delicate aromas of acacia flower, honey and pear. The lean palate shows hints of beeswax, honey and tropical fruit flavors that finish abruptly."
Riesling,"One barrel from each of the three estate vineyards contributed to this reserve. It's densely packed with a rich mix of fruits: juicy and ripe lemon and lime, grapefruit and orange, and a light touch of slightly bitter rind. The length is amazing. It's delicious now, and it should hold for up to a decade."
Riesling,"This combination of tingling grapefruit spice, pure lemon and leafy lemon balm on the nose is utterly disarming. The touch of green apple makes it even more alluring. The palate jumbles all of these fresh, lithe, bright and appetizing flavors together and swirls them across the palate on a joyous, light-footed lemon sweep. Oh for the pleasure of Riesling in a vintage that majors on freshness rather than ripeness. This dances on the tongue with its dryness, purity and aromatic ease. Underneath all that is concentration and a stony, firm core that anchors this in quality. A lovely, promising and utterly charming wine. Drink 2017–2030."
Riesling,"Produced in the Vallée Noble sub-region in Soultzmatt, this is ripe and powerfully rich. It is strongly perfumed, full of white fruit and very floral in character. A thread of minerality runs through this still-young wine giving structure. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,"Aromas of flowers, mandarin orange, lime and lees lead to a medium-sweet palate. There's intrigue but it doesn't have the concentration to hold it all together."
Riesling,"Christine Saahs is a believer that high alcohol is not a necessity for a powerful, rich wine. And this proves her point. There is weight here, intensity, but the lower alcohol gives the wine poise and delicacy. It stays fresh, and will age with that freshness intact. Keep for another 4–5 years."
Riesling,"Petrol leads the nose, which also deals pear and melon in a solid facsimile of Alsace. The palate is lemony and cut by streaking acidity, while the flavors of citrus run tart and monotone. Finishes zesty, with green apple and lemon."
Riesling,"This is a full, fruity wine. It's ripe and packed with currant, green plum and pink grapefruit flavors. There are hints of almond and delicate flower aromas. The soft finish has more ripe, delicious fruit."
Riesling,"Just a touch of residual sugar (11 g/L) softens up the edges of this wine, which brings flavors of tart lemon, grapefruit pith and wet paper into play. Try it with prawns, shellfish or non-spicy noodle dishes."
Riesling,"With 45g/L residual sugar, it drinks quite sweet but doesn't have the acidity to hold together its notes of green grapes, jasmine and stone fruit."
Riesling,"This is already mature. It has weight and demonstrates a delicious balance between a ripe white-fruit flavor and fresh acidity, with a fine note of tangy citrus. Ready to drink."
Riesling,"Tender, fresh yeasty notes play among citrus, insinuating stones and ripe, yellow plums that unfold completely on the slender but ripe palate. Lemon blossom and fresh lemon juice keep a tight hold around the burgeoning plum fruit. Underneath it all is comforting and grounding earthiness. While its aromas soar, this wine keeps both its feet firmly on the ground."
Riesling,"Slender poise and supercharged lemon are signaled with the first sniff. A pleasantly bitter note—think almond or Castelfranco—plays along the edges of the palate before riper, more generous yellow plum kicks in, always toned by that citrus freshness. Drink now to 2025."
Riesling,"A rich layer of caramelized honey penetrates through bristling limes, lemons and tangerines in this sprightly medium-sweet Riesling. It's light as a feather yet pulsating with sweet yellow peach and apricot flavors. Vibrantly acidic but nuanced and substantial, it drinks gorgeously now but has enough substance to age well through at least 2025."
Riesling,"Quite earthy in profile with hints of smoke, petroleum and fresh green herbs, there's a distinct minerality in this off-dry Riesling that's compelling. Brisk lime-juice acidity and a hint of citrus rind bitterness accentuates the dry finish."
Riesling,Hints of earth and mushrooms lend a savory tone to aromas of pressed apples and pears in this off-dry wine. The palate is bright and cheery with sweet apple and lemon flavors but finishes with a lingering spray of savory dried herbs and stems.
Riesling,"This is textbook Clare Valley dry Riesling, with lime sherbet aromas and flavors that come across as slightly one-dimensional at this young age. It's medium bodied, with a slightly dusty texture that's especially notable on the long finish. Drink now–2025."
Riesling,"Spicy and floral, with super concentration, this fruit bomb of a wine is 100% Riesling, though the aromatics have the rose petal, soapy character of some Washington Gewürztraminers. The depth and intensity of the fruit are remarkable, but may make this a challenge to match with food, even spicy Asian noodle dishes."
Riesling,"This Riesling is distinctly off-dry. It's rich with sugary orange and lime jam, white flower and mineral flavors, with the brisk acidity associated with the Arroyo Seco region. Easy to drink now."
Riesling,"The nose merely reveals the slightest shimmer of ripe lemon zest. The palate comes in with beautifully spicy mirabelle flavors, tempered by tangy citrus. There is lovely citrus concentration that has a zesty textural element in the streamlined body. This is wonderfully bracing, ripe and refreshing. A total joy."
Riesling,"Fresh apple and white floral aromas are dusted with caramelized sugar and smoke on this dry, mineral-tinged wine. Edgy and lean on the palate but supple in grapefruit flavor, it's a honed, steely white with polish and elegance."
Riesling,"Such breezy freshness, such citric concentration on a slender, very streamlined body. Bright, lemony flavors fizz everywhere and create a feeling of lightness, but with a firm backbone. A clean, taut finish."
Riesling,"This off-dry wine is solid, with a mix of lemons and oranges in a broad, fruity midpalate. A thick streak of sweet tea comes up also, and the wine, though blocky and one-dimensional, is quite nice chilled down as an apéritif."
Riesling,The peel of ripe pears paired with a soft lemon freshness characterizes this somewhat earthy wine. The earthiness becomes stronger on the dry palate but is brightened by lemony acidity and a clean-cut finish.
Riesling,"This is Fred Loimer's star wine, the summit of his ambition at extracting the purest quality possible from his fruit. The wine has apricot, lime, touches of honey for a  very shapely but full-bodied profile. There is a hint of toastiness, fitting beautifully into the white fruits and final acidity. Age for 4–5 years at least."
Riesling,"Ripe, heady tropical fruit and citrus aromas extend onto the palate of this dry, yet deeply fruity, concentrated Riesling. It's unabashedly juicy, but textured and mineral on the palate, finishing long and with a streak of high-toned acidity."
Riesling,"This medium-dry spätlese balances savory with sweet. Initially earthy, mineral tones build to plumper peach and pear through the midpalate. It's gossamer in texture, but finishes strong with a polished strike of steel and acid."
Riesling,"Light as a feather yet bold in fruit, this sprightly spätlese packs a punch of sweet, ripe apricot, peach and even raspberry flavors. Spine tingling grapefruit acidity lends vitality, guiding a breathlessly perfumed, floral finish. It's a thrilling, irresistible wine."
Riesling,"Shows the brilliantly clean, racy acidity of Monterey that provides backbone and firmness to the citrus, peach, wildflower and mineral flavors. With a hint of diesel, it's a lovely California Riesling at a great price."
Riesling,"This nose is a lovely mix of lemon peel and camphor leaves, intriguing and refreshing and just a little heady. The palate is streamlined and slender and of great purity. This is lithe but intense, slender but profound. It shows what Riesling is capable of in a cooler year. Stockpile this since it will last and get ever more delicious. Drink now till 2020."
Riesling,"Chiseled and spunky, this slightly older Riesling shows complex slate, lime zest and wet stone notes on the nose while intense stone fruits dominate the palate. Drink now."
Riesling,"Bitter orange rind and spice notes accent layers of sweet honey, pineapple and mango in this lusciously sweet, silky ice wine. Strikes of lemon-lime acidity add zest and vibrance through a long, lingering finish."
Riesling,"Pleasantly plump and custardy in texture, this complex, mouthfilling wine offers a whirl of aromas and flavors, ranging from fresh asphalt to lime custard and green apple. By the finish, any objectionable notes have vanished, leaving a clean, lingering finish beaming with elegance. Consider decanting if drinking in the near future, or simply hold 3–5 years before sampling."
Riesling,"Despite the low alcohol reading, this comes across as dry rather than off dry. Apple, pear and white peach anchor a just-ripe-enough wine with highlights of citrus oil. There's good length and focus throughout."
Riesling,"Waxy lemon peel accents savory apple and quince notes in this dry, zesty Riesling. While expansive on the palate with bold, voluminous body, it finishes brisk and tart."
Riesling,"At this point subdued, this wine promises future pleasures with a ripe, rounded but precise character. Right now, it's citrus that shows, with ripe lemon zest and some grapefruit. Underneath riches of red apples, yellow peaches and apricots await. Purity and minerality are a bonus. This is a keeper; drink as of 2018."
Riesling,"Young and visibly spritzy, this appealing wine bursts forth with scents of lemon tea and orange blossoms, followed by flavors of orange soda, candied pineapple and stone fruits. It's round and fruity, definitely sweet, but kept lively with plenty of acid and that tongue-tickling spritz."
Riesling,"This is made from old vines and fermented dry in stainless-steel tank and barrel, retaining freshness and body in its moderate approach. Apricot, pear and biscuit highlight the experience, as a taste of lemon candy closes things out."
Riesling,"Crisp lime, peach and pineapple flavors mark this refreshingly brisk late-harvest wine. Its delicate sweetness is offset by pristine layers of crushed slate and river rocks. The finish is exhilarating and fresh. Drink now through 2020."
Riesling,"Ripe Mirabelle and purple plums dominate the nose, with a notion of intense plum compote. The palate reveals that all of this ripeness is streaked with lively lemon zest, pulling the sumptuous fruit into clearer focus. The finish remains ripe and opulent."
Riesling,"This is the medium-dry Riesling from this estate vineyard, a notch lower in alcohol than the Dry bottling, and overall a bit rounder. It carries the same excellent texture, length and mix of ripe fruits, with pears and nectarines taking center stage."
Riesling,"Riesling that is just becoming mature is the foundation of this perfumed, white fruit and complex wine. Dried apricot and spice cake flavors give the wine richness and balance the fruitiness that is now maturing. Drink this fine wine now."
Riesling,"Terraced vineyards with poor soil allow the Riesling to struggle as it ripens. This gives terroir-driven mineral tension to this tight, coiled wine, full of acidity and grapefruit flavors. The aftertaste is so fresh that the wine seems to just float away."
Riesling,"Ebullient on the nose with scents of fresh white peach and tart Meyer-lemon. This dry Riesling is deliciously peachy on the palate, as well. Juicy and brisk with soft citrus acidity, it finishes with a hint of waxy lime-skin on the finish."
Riesling,"Apple and pear notes have a slightly savory tone in this brisk, lemony dry Riesling. Throughout a tasting of two samples, there are lingering tones of rubber and struck matches that blow off gradually with aeration."
Riesling,"The Kaseler Nies'chen's steep slope of blue slate faces the sunny south, accounting for this northerly site's ability to produce a dry Riesling that reached 12% alcohol in 2008. Although many Ruwer and Saar wines seem overly lean and sinewy when made in a dry style, this example verges on opulent, with exotic tropical fruit notes."
Riesling,"Honey and the perfumed notes of quince are immediately apparent on this Spätlese Riesling. The sweetness is carried beautifully by ripe notions of peach, additional quince and apricot coulis, balanced and countered by the fresh, ripe and pliable acidity of oranges and tangerines. This is slightly decadent and very harmonious. Perhaps sweet enough for an apricot tart but certainly a killer with salty blue cheeses. No other grape can perform the same tightrope walk as Riesling. Enjoy."
Riesling,"Friendly, fresh ripe apples beckon on the nose. The pure and fruit-driven palate follows suit, presenting flavors of juicy, ripe apples. A smidgen of residual sugar boosts these delicious fruit flavors and turns up the volume on ease and joy but Riesling's vibrant freshness counters this masterfully so the finish is just off dry. This is lovely, bouncy and full of joy. Drink 2017–2022."
Riesling,"Dusty slate and spice tones intensify this brisk, grapefruit-laced Kabinett from the famed Josephshöfer site. Sweet-tart lemon and tangerine flavors are scintillating and brisk, enriched by a luscious mineral slick that lingers on the palate. Its sharp, linear style is attractive already but should meld gorgeously from 2021."
Riesling,"Judged as medium-sweet on the international scale, this shows petrol and lime Jell-o on the nose. The palate is not overly sweet but certainly not dry, offering honeyed lemon curds and sugared lime-peel flavors."
Riesling,"Loosen's '09 auslese from the Sonnenuhr unleashes a cavalcade of ripe tropical fruit, ranging from pineapple and guava to carambola and lime. It's very sweet and isn't showing much more than fruit at this point in time, but it should develop additional complexity with cellaring."
Riesling,"A very savory, earthy character appears amid the lemon-zest palate that also features a salty, rock-solid statement. This is not for the fainthearted: a compact bundle of pure life with an utterly compelling nature and a lip-smackingly clean finish."
Riesling,"Spicy and floral on the nose, this is surprisingly round and soft for an Australian Riesling, but still attractive. Try it young as an apéritif, where the gentleness will subtly prime your palate for things to come."
Riesling,"Intensely smoky, dusty mineral aromas on this Riesling dissipate with aeration to reveal a delightful bouquet of white blossoms and stonefruit. The palate is bright with citrus acidity and sweet yellow cherries. While lively and fresh now, it should develop remarkable complexity over the next 5–7 years."
Riesling,"Milla Handley is attempting to make an Alsatian-style wine that is indeed austere, with an almost almond-butter and earthy, mushroom nose that's well balanced between acidity and tropical sweetness and finishes smooth. A suggested pairing with sushi is right on."
Riesling,"This succulent effort proves once again that a hot site can make excellent Riesling in Washington state. The Cold Creek signature minerality provides the base, and the fruit, vibrant and fresh, brings juicy acidity as well. The wine sails into a creamy finish that demands a glass refill."
Riesling,"Lime-zesty purity couples with an earthy, almost spicy edge. Pleasantly grippy phenolics speak of ripeness and plentitude while remaining streamlined, straight and long. This has yet to blossom but will be lovely. Drink as of 2017."
Riesling,"Crop yields were down substantially in 2010, so perhaps that is why so many of the top estates' entry-level wines are so exciting. This one combines hints of wet stones and moss with multifaceted citrus nuances and struck flint, resulting in remarkable complexity. It's round and mouthfilling yet focused and long."
Riesling,"Savory apple and lemon scents open this delicately composed, but intensely minerally spätlese. The palate is ripe, with juicy yellow peach and orange flavors, anchored by earthy tones of crushed rock and slate that linger on the finish."
Rosé,"Made from a 50-50 combination of old vine Gamay and Charbono, both grown in Calistoga, this wine opens in a nondescript way and offers a thick texture of tannin and density, becoming shyly fruity in the glass, a mix of cherry and strawberry."
Rosé,"Strawberry and raspberry aromas are slightly brambly and peppery on the nose. The medium-bodied palate is driven by mulberry and stone-fruit flavors, yet balanced by just enough citrus verve."
Rosé,"One of Spain's top value-oriented rosés. It's inviting, colorful, easy to understand and tasty. Aromas of fresh fruits and melon get it going, while the palate is clean, fresh, only mildly candied and full of cherry and red plum flavors. Scores high by keeping it simple. Drink ASAP."
Rosé,"Though unstated on the label, this is made from Pinot Gris. It seems to be glowing, an almost day-glo shade of orange, and is quite dry, with flavors of pine needles and watermelon."
Rosé,"This ripe, earthy wine with spice delivers a lightly tannic character. Rich, it's made to go with food, full of red-berry fruits and acidity. The aftertaste has a tangy, peppery edge."
Rosé,"Simple and fruity, this is ready for summer drinking. It is very fresh, crisp, lightly textured and with fragrant, refreshing acidity. A touch of pepper gives the aftertaste attractive spice."
Rosé,"With an inviting strawberry sundae nose, this bright pink rosé of Syrah from the longtime organically minded team at Buttonwood is all about summertime hedonism. There's creaminess on the palate, with some apple tartness in the middle and, again, long strawberry elements on the finish. Pair with beef sliders on soft, sweet rolls that are adorned with gourmet condiments and cheeses."
Rosé,"With its Mourvèdre content, this is a big-hearted wine. It is finely balanced between its rich yellow and red fruits and spice and acidity. This is a great food rosé, textured and ripe."
Rosé,"Fresh and fruity, this balances ripe red fruits with a touch of caramel and light, crisp acidity. It is fragrant and perfumed, and would make an excellent apéritif."
Rosé,"A very pale wine—it's just barely pink. With Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, it has a fine structured character that gives the wine weight. There are also refreshingly attractive red-berry fruits and a ripe aftertaste. Drink this complex wine from late 2017."
Rosé,"Light and delicate bubblegum aromas are cut by pink lemonade, a touch of honeydew and a peachy ripeness on this blend of 67% Grenache, 22% Picpoul Blanc, 8% Mourvèdre and 3% Syrah. There is lots of minerality on the sip, with rainy slate and wet cement, as well as rounded watermelon, strawberry and bubblegum flavors, all sliced by lime and tangerine zest."
Rosé,"The word scrumptious applies here. This rich and complex rosé from Eric Hamacher is a mix of saignée juice and Pinot Noir blanc that wasn't quite blanc enough—a happy accident, since it's packed with raspberry confit and plum jam flavors, with a hint of cranberry sauce. Coming up on two years past fermentation, it's a wine to drink now."
Rosé,"All estate grown and stainless steel fermented, this is a pale pink rosé that's packed with flavor. Watermelon and strawberry fruit flavors stand out, with plenty of citrus tang in the aftertaste."
Rosé,"The palest color leads to a perfumed, very ready-to-drink wine. It is crisp with fruit that is now softened by a year's aging, offering a touch of caramel along with crushed strawberry flavors. Drink now."
Rosé,"This is an easy blush wine, dryish and tart in acidity, with a light, silky texture. Made from 100% Grenache, it shows pleasant orange, pink grapefruit and honey flavors."
Rosé,"This red-tinted, full-bodied rosé is strained on the nose, with a strong, distinct whiff of wet animal fur. The palate feels heavy and unfocused, while flavors of plum skins and nectarine finish bitter and without any crispness or cleansing properties."
Rosé,"Named after a young goat in early Indo-European mythology, this full-bodied, ripe wine has yellow fruits as well as red-berry flavors. A pepper edge contrasts with the fruitiness and gives the wine a rich texture. The fruit and acidity come through strongly at the end."
Rosé,"Strawberry and cherry aromas lead in to this layered but brisk rosé from Drama. On the palate, spices, tropical fruit and a finish of salinity give the wine elegant character. A delicious and versatile pour with exotic notes."
Rosé,"The wine is crisp, full of red berry fruit and lively acidity, with a smooth texture. This is terrific as an accompaniment to a summer meal or as an apéritif. The finish is deliciously fruity. Screwcap."
Rosé,"A rosé of Sangiovese, Montepulciano and Syrah, this has flavors of herb and raspberry, which are etched with nervy acids."
Rosé,"This pink blend of 64% Grenache, 31% Syrah and 6% Marsanne offers the expected array of bubblegum, pink roses, peach, watermelon and cool steel aromas on the nose. It's wound nice and tight on the palate, with warm notes of strawberry and bubblegum emerging on the midpalate, leveled by lemon-skin tartness and a chalky tension."
Rosé,"This is a soft wine, fruity without great definition. A ripe, red fruit character contrasts with a bitter acidity. It is ready to drink. The blend is 50/50 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon."
Rosé,"This wine starts off a bit tarry or rubbery, but with airing that dissipates to reveal a dry, savory, complex rosé. It's a blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre that builds in layers of texture from chalky to silky on the finish."
Rosé,"Round and harmonious on the palate, this wine is a terrific value. Floral notes mark the nose, backed up by raspberry and strawberry fruit, while an undercurrent of crushed stone provides depth and backbone. The finish is berry-filled, but balanced and savory."
Rosé,"Packaged in a lovely, Champagne-like bottle (but without a cage), this is very pretty, with a hint of cherry candy. The palate is round, full and forward. This is a wine to set on the table for a special occasion—but don't wait too long."
Rosé,"Boldly fruity, redolent with cherries and pink grapefruit, this medium-bodied rosé does have a slightly candied quality to it, but remains a decent summertime quaff. Serve well chilled to help mute the apparent sweetness."
Rosé,"This 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah has yielded a medium-bodied, pale coppery rosé. It's dry and refreshing, hinting at red currants, pink grapefruit and melon. Drink now."

Rosé,"This 100% Pinot Noir rosé is ripe and full of red fruit, with a touch of caramel. It shows an attractive streak of acidity on the finish."
Rosé,"This pale, copper-tinged rosé boasts aromas of melon, citrus and stone fruit. It's medium in weight, with a silky feel on the palate and harmonious blend of fruit that finishes crisp. Drink now."
Rosé,"Despite ruddy, ripe raspberry and strawberry flavors, there's a leanness to this tart, savory dry rosé. Savory layers of bramble and herb are prominent on the midpalate."
Rosé,"A strongly perfumed wine, this is soft and just off-dry in character with some sucrosity. Crisp, fresh berry fruits are laced with acidity and finished with orange zest."
Rosé,"This wine is tangy and textured with light tannins, a bite of citrus acidity and plenty of fruit. It's bright and has a juicy, lively aftertaste. Drink now."
Rosé,"Fragrantly floral, this stunner offers delightful bursts of lemon, grapefruit and pomelo, as well as succulent raspberry. The acidity is persistent and tangy. Light-bodied and yet complex, it's easy to love and enjoy being just right for the table, beach blanket or kayak."
Rosé,"Tight citrus aromas meet with bubblegum and wet stone on the somewhat reserved though clean and inviting nose of this wine. The flavors are also quite light, with strawberry and lemon touches, so the point is more of the racy acidity and slight tannic grip."
Rosé,"A blend from a wider area than just Côtes de Provence, the wine is lightly spicy, full of red fruits and citrus acidity. There is a typical touch of pepper that adds extra interest to what is a refreshing wine."

Rosé,"Fruity, young and soft, this is an attractive Touriga Nacional-Syrah wine with strawberry flavors and just a touch of crisp red currant acidity. It's made for this summer, ready to drink."
Rosé,"A vibrant pink hue in the glass, this rosé has nice ripe fruit aromas of wild strawberry and fresh cherry that follow through to the juicy, red fruit-dominating mouth. Round and full, the rich mouth could use a bit more cut."
Rosé,"Hints of overripe peach and mealy apple indicate a rich, ripe style of rosé, but are immediately followed by accents of green melon, plum and menthol, adding balance and tension. Medium weight, with ample acidity that keeps the ripe fruit flavors balanced and refreshing through the finish."
Rosé,"This bold, ripe blend even contains some Muscat that gives richness and a touch of honey and spice to what is otherwise a dry rosé. The acidity acts as a balance to this attractive wine."
Rosé,"There are pretty hints of rose petal and fresh apple on this dry Cabernet Franc rosé, but it's a tad savory in style, with layers of smoke, dried herb, leaf and stem. It's a nice accompaniment to everyday meals."
Rosé,"A clear salmon color in the glass, this value-priced rosé opens with attractive notes of white flowers, strawberry and peach, with the faintest hint of white chocolate in the back. Despite the rich, ripe aromas, the mouthfeel is lightweight and well balanced by ample orangy acidity."
Rosé,"From organic grapes in a blend of Grenache, Cinsault, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is rich and ripe. Generous red fruits are cut with light acidity and broadened by the smooth, creamy texture. The fruit lasts right through to the end."
Rosé,"Medium salmon-colored in the glass, this rosé has a nose of tangerine and toffee. Flavors of tangerine, butterscotch and clove maintain a nice balance between spice and fruit flavors. The mellow finish features a dash of zesty acidity and a final wash of butterscotch."
Rosé,"Kevin Riley packs eight varieties into this pink wine, but the major proportion of Syrah and Grenache lend it its deep hue and rose petal, red cherry and vanilla notes on the nose. Grippy red plum skin flavors dominate the compellingly tense palate, followed by Rainier cherry and orange rind touches."
Rosé,"The apricot and peach-yogurt scents come across as a bit soapy before the strawberry and sour cherry notes surface. The palate is supple and easygoing, and although it lacks some concentration, it tastes fresh and fruity."
Rosé,"This wine is textured and fruity. Crisp citrus and red-currant fruits are layered with bright acidity and a refreshing aftertaste. The wine could do with a few more months before drinking, so wait until late 2016."
Rosé,"With some weight, this has raspberry flavor to go with its sweetness. Berry fruits dominate in a wine that is full in the mouth."
Rosé,"Producer of one of the first rosé Vinho Verde, Casa do Valle continues to make one of the best. Full of delicious strawberry flavors with great acidity, deliciously fruity."
Rosé,This wine has a caramel edge that gives richness but also detracts from the fruit. It offers a smooth texture along with a spicy edge. Drink now.
Rosé,This pink blend of Mourvèdre and Grenache shows rosy aromas as well as a bitter orange scent and yeasty qualities. The palate is light in both flavor and texture but makes for a refreshing hot day sipper.
Rosé,"High acidity marks this wine, giving it a crisp character with subdued fruitiness. That should change over the next few months, so drink from late 2017."

Rosé,"A fresh, high-acid wine, with flavors of raspberry and apple. It's crisp, with fruit that is barely ripe. Needs plenty of chilling."
Rosé,"Turkey Flat's rosé has been an Aussie staple for more than decade. The 2015 is 92% Grenche, with the balance a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Dolcetto and Mataro. Crushed stone and red berry scents lead the way, followed by flavors that are reminiscent of white chocolate and strawberries. It's fairly weighty for a rosé, with a long, slightly viscous finish."
Rosé,"With some extra weight, this is a solid, red currant and berry driven wine. Its fruit is right up front, backed by a mineral acidity that cuts through the richness. It's definitely a food wine, and equally an impressive wine that needs to age for up to a year."
Rosé,"Stylish and fruity, this has red currant crispness and an attractive warm, ripe background. It's balanced and fresh, with intense fruitiness at the end."
Rosé,"This is a pale, peach-scented rosé, with hints of cherries as well. The blend of 40% Cinsault, 30% Grenache and 30% Syrah lacks the lively acids of some Provençal rosés, but features a pleasant roundness on the palate instead, finishing soft and easy. Imported by Routas USA."
Rosé,"Compact berry and plum aromas set up a solid, nice palate with nectarine and raspberry flavors. This is very drinkable and easygoing; the finish is mellow but propped up by core acidity."

Rosé,"A blend of co-fermented Syrah (60%) and Viognier, this wine is a very pretty pale copper color with just a tinge of salmon. It offers nuanced aromas of pear, strawberry and white flowers. The palate is dry and fresh, sleek but with depth and texture to the fruit flavors."

Rosé,Dainty strokes of crisp-tart raspberry and watermelon rind accent this finely textured rosé. It's a brisk delicately concentrated wine with a brambly lingering finish. Drink now.

Rosé,"Light pink in color, this is a pretty wine made from 100% Grolleau. It is soft, medium sweet with integrated acidity that comes from the fresh raspberries. It is ready to drink."
Rosé,"Syrah-like aromas make this an attractive, soft wine. Its red berry fruit and balanced acidity are well in place for warm-weather drinking."
Rosé,"This is Mordorée's top cuvée of Tavel, and it earns that distinction by virtue of its length and stoniness on the finish. There's a hint of garrigue to the cherry aromas and a plump, complex midpalate as well. Drink it over the next year or two."
Rosé,"Corvina, Rondinella and Dindarella—three grapes native to the Verona area of Northern Italy—make up this fresh and lively, easy-sipping rosé. The wine awards pretty aromas of raspberry and white cherry."

Rosé,"An attractively fragrant rosé, this is very crisp and clean. It has lively raspberry and red currant flavors that are lightly touched by a herb note. A bright finish completes this refreshing wine."

Rosé,"Made from Castelão, the local grape of the Setúbal region, this wine is as bright and clean as possible. The light texture makes it ideal for summer drinking."
Rosé,"Just what you want in a rosé, at a good price. It's a robust wine, dryish and spicy, with a creamy mouthfeel framing pleasant raspberry, cherry, prosciutto and vanilla flavors."
Rosé,"Dried raspberry, strawberry and cherry aromas flesh out the bouquet of this rosé. The medium-weight mouthfeel is ripe and round, with soft lift from the light acidity. A hint of astringent citrus peel unfolds on the finish."
Rosé,"Rich and smooth, this wine shows delicious red fruits as well as good acidity. It is stylish, ripe with fruit and with a tight texture that hints at minerality. The wine is ready to drink."
Rosé,"An appealing pale salmon color, this blend of 50% Cinsault, 28% Grenache and 22% Syrah displays aromas of strawberry, cherry Jolly Rancher and melon. Reflective of the warmth of the vintage, it's fruitier than recent vintages but it's still hard to put down."
Rosé,"This is a real food wine, with its tangy texture, touch of spice and attractive acidity. Light fruitiness and a dry core give a structured character. Drink now."
Rosé,"Grown on hills overlooking the Mediterranean, this wine sings of sunshine and warm days. It is fruity, fatter than in some previous vintages although still with good acidity and a lively aftertaste."
Rosé,"This wine is a very pale peach color. Aromas of strawberry candy, watermelon and citrus peel lead to light dry-fruit flavors. The concentration seems a bit lacking."
Rosé,"This medium-bodied blend features aromas and flavors reminiscent of bubble gum and cantaloupe. It's mainly Grenache and Cinsault, which impart ample weight, balanced by some slightly bitter, pithy notes on the finish."

Rosé,"This is an excellent rosé with some red-wine character showing through the pale-salmon color and fresh fruitiness. It has slightly meaty, spicy and cherry-like flavors, a good balance between medium body and firm acidity, and a nice tangy finish."
Rosé,"This Tavel contains a hefty 20% Clairette (a white grape), in addition to the more common Grenache (Noir) and Cinsault. It's still a chunky, powerful version of Tavel, with raspberry and white chocolate notes buoyed by just enough citrus. It's broad and mouthcoating on the finish."
Rosé,"Full and rounded, this is a soft wine, more suited to food than as an aperitif. The apple and red currant fruits are textured and spiced with lemon zest and mandarin orange flavors, finishing with some richness."
Rosé,"The name is a reference to the youngest member of the family, obviously a lively kid. The wine is pretty lively as well with plenty of bright acidity, crisp red fruits and just a touch of caramel. Drink now."

Rosé,"Stylish and fruity, this has red currant crispness and an attractive warm, ripe background. It's balanced and fresh, with intense fruitiness at the end."
Rosé,"Fleshy strawberry notes vie with Golden Delicious apple flavors. The palate continues with this competition and throws in lemon freshness. This is easy, dry, fleshy and joyful. Drink soon."
Rosé,"A touch of cranberry plays on the nose of this wine. The palate shows that same tart freshness, assisted by lemony notes and a slight spritz. An easy, uncomplicated and refreshing summer wine."

Rosé,"A medium cherry-red color, this wine offer fruit-filled aromas of strawberry bubble gum, pomegranate and cherry. It drinks a hair off dry, with broad, fleshy fruit flavors that linger."
Rosé,"Intense red berry and cherry notes shine through this Cabernet Franc rosé. Brisk acidity refreshes, but eight months of barrel aging and lees stirring lend an unusually lactic feel to the palate."
Rosé,"A beautiful blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, this delivers structure and power wrapped within delicate notes of wild berry, bitter almond, dried blueberry and chopped herb. The close is thickly structured and fresh."

Rosé,"With 50% Mourvèdre in the blend, this is an aromatic, ripe and complex wine. It has a sense of structure, with tannins as well as zesty orange and layers of spice. The aftertaste is more floral and fresh, although there is a touch of pepper right at the end."
Rosé,This is a new wine designed to be a “grown-up rosé” from the Cronk family who moved from London to Provence in 2009. It is a ripe fruity and rich blend of Grenache and Syrah. Weight as well as contrasting acidity give a structured character that balances well with the intense fruitiness. Drink the wine from late 2017.
Rosé,"This taut, intense wine is a bit angular compared to many Tavels, but pull out a bottle around Thanksgiving, and it should be singing. Cherry and citrus flavors collide on the palate, but should merge into a seamless whole with a bit of bottle age."
Rosé,"Savory smoked-nut notes juxtapose ripe red cherry and strawberry in this full-bodied rosé. While quite substantial in mouthfeel, it has bright citrus acidity that lends some refreshment on the finish."

Rosé,"This is one of the classics among Provence rosés. Produced from organically grown grapes and coming from an impressive red-wine producing estate east of Aix-en-Provence, the wine is structured and ageworthy with its blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon. Rich and full of red fruits, the wine should be drunk from late 2017."

Rosé,"This is a rather big and rich wine that has a deep orange-pink color, along with quite a bit of body and red-fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth, as plum and melon flavors meet soft acidity. It's more like a red wine than most of today's rosés, but is a pleasure to drink."
Rosé,"It's hard to believe it's possible to buy this quality rosé for so little money. Mouthwatering scents of raspberry, stone fruit and crushed stone emerge from the glass, followed by rich, ripe fruit flavors balanced by just-enough citrusy acidity.

Rosé,"A bright, slightly confected rosé blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Grenache and Cinsault, this is flavorful but a bit short."

Rosé,"A fine example of what Tavel can be, this is a full-bodied, luscious rosé with a bit of sturdiness to its structure. Cherry and peach notes fade into hints of fresh herb and cocoa on the long, harmonious finish. Drink now and through the summer of 2014."
Rosé,"Pale salmon in color, this wine is 63% Mourvèdre and 37% Grenache. Aromas of fresh strawberry, watermelon, spice and cherry lead to bone-dry mouthwatering fruit flavors. It brings a lot of appeal."
Rosé,"Pale in the extreme, this wood-aged wine is a sister to the estate's top cuvée, Garrus. This wine is maybe less intense and more approachable when young, although still with the same beautiful fruit. Red berries shine through the edge of toastiness and spice, balanced by good acidity."
Rosé,"This is a Provençal-style blush made of Mourvèdre, Grenache, Cinsault and Syrah. It's a little sugary sweet, with raspberry, orange and vanilla flavors."

Rosé,"With a dark, weird red-orange color, this rosé feels heavy and candied in raspberry and orange fruit. It's a little sweet."
Rosé,"Produced from bled-off Pinot Noir juice, this is a robust, high alcohol rosé. It was put through partial malolactic fermentation and offers candy strawberry flavors up front, without much depth."
Rosé,"Here's an interesting rosé fans of obscure winegrapes will love. It's 90% Tibouren, an old variety indigenous to Provence that's known for its finesse but also for its difficulty in the vineyard. This wine also stays an entire year in tank resting on its lees, so it's not a fruit-forward rosé at all. Hints of apricot and peach are subtle, with the emphasis being on the wines crisp acids and dry finish."

Rosé,"This is a round full style of rosé. As a result, it is also soft and rich. The balance between the ripe strawberry fruits and the crisper acidity is just right. Drink this wine now."
Rosé,"This wine is principally Cabernet Franc along with dollops of Malbec and Petit Verdot. A pretty pale salmon color, it offers very primary aromas of strawberry, green pepper and spice. The palate drinks dry with lovely fruit flavors and acid that brings tension and keeps the interest high."
Rosé,"The 18th-century estate's second wine is bright, crisp and fresh with attractive acidity and a lively, juicy aftertaste. Drink immediately."

Rosé,"Ott specializes in rosés with weight and alcohol. Everything is so well integrated that they are only a part of a rich, fruity wine that has a dense texture, with spice and generous strawberry fruits. Full and definitely for food, the wine should be aged another few months, so drink from mid-2016."

Rosé,"A blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Clairette and 20% Syrah, this wine represents a relative bargain in the rarified realm of Tavel.

It's a relatively full-bodied rosé that can stand up to grilled meats."

Rosé,"This excellent rosé is one of a handful given extra bottle age before release, and it rewards that time with unusual flavors––rhubarb and strawberry, hints of banana and a touch of creamsicle in the fade. Not typical in any way, but tasty and full-bodied."
Rosé,"This wine is full in the mouth with a taste between pepper and fruit. It's ripe, rounded and tangy with clementine zest as well crisp apples and red currants. It could benefit from a few months in bottle, so drink from late 2015."
Rosé,"Tempranillo could be an interesting variety in South Australia going forward. This rosé features hints of sous bois and cherries on the nose, then adds melon and spice notes on the palate. It's plump in the mouth, then finishes on a dry, silky note."
Rosé,"Pale and refreshing, this is lightly scented by orange blossoms and strawberries, with similar flavors following. It's a splendid sipping wine, with plenty of acid to buoy up the light fruit."
Rosé,This blend of and Syrah is more ripe fruit than freshness. It is rounded and soft with caramel and spice flavors as well as rich strawberries. Drink now.
Rosé,"Vidal-Fleury ages its wines longer than most other Rhône firms, so don't be concerned that this is “a year behind” other Tavels on the market. It's the one rosé appellation that can handle a bit of bottle age, so this is at its peak. It shows typical Tavel weight and richness, but also savory, almost meaty or mushroomy elements, balanced by bright citrus notes. Drink now."

Rosé,"This wine is tangy and cool in character. Red fruits are poised, reflecting the light color of the wine. Fresh and crisp, this is ready to drink."

Rosé,"Sourced from grapes outside the family's Mas de Cadenet estate, this wine is light, fresh and immediately attractive. Its clear, open texture is ripe but refreshing with a soft fruity aftertaste. The name means “sleepless night” because the grapes are harvested at night."
Rosé,"From a vineyard at the western end of the Côtes de Provence, this is a smooth, caramel and spice-flavored wine. It has a tangy herbal character that brings a contrast to the bright red fruits. Drink now."
Rosé,"For the vintage, this is a rich wine. It has spice, an herbal edge and a touch of pepper. Its red fruits are superripe with a bitter bite that masks the acidity. Let this settle for a few months and drink from 2018."
Rosé,"The wine comes from the Alpilles mountains, made famous by Van Gogh's paintings. It has a tight, steely character that comes from the wild terroir while keeping delicious freshness and acidity. It could age until late 2014."

Rosé,"Despite the low abv, this is a dry rosé, made from 100% Sangiovese that was picked at 20.5 brix. It's delicate and satisfying—a pretty pale copper/rose color, with flavors of strawberry hinting at peach. There's a dusting of baking spices and cocoa, adding welcome highlights to the finish."
Rosé,"This wine is very soft ,with only light acidity to balance the raspberry fruitiness. What makes this wine is its aftertaste with a final crisp bite. Drink now."

Rosé,"The second vintage of this Rainstorm rosé sports fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry, with hints of fresh cracker in both the aroma and the finish. But it's the fresh fruit that's driving the flavor bus here, with some added length and detail as it winds down, perhaps due in part to the native yeast fermentation."
Rosé,"Full of raspberry fruits but also with some structure, this is a ready-to-drink apéritif wine. Lively acidity give it a crisp aftertaste."
Rosé,"As the name of this cuvée indicates, the grapes for this bottling come from sandier parcels within the appellation.

Rosé,This is a full-bodied wine that has plenty of weight and richness. It has spice as well as ripe red fruits; its balanced with delicious acidity and a dart of orange peel.
Rosé,"A good rosé, crisp and light-bodied. It has rich strawberry, orange zest, vanilla and spice flavors. Nice and silky in the mouth, as a blush wine should be, but it's a little on the sweet side."

It is ripe, light and packed with acidity at the end."
Rosé,"From an old vineyard on chalky soil, this wine has some concentration as well as a tight mineral texture. This is warm and ripe as well as fruity and crisp. It is a rich wine that has also retained crispness and great acidity. Drink from the end of 2017 or even early 2018."

Rosé,"This is classy in every way, from the label to the aromatics to the mouthfeel to the elegant finish. It's a New World take on a Sancerre rouge: delicate and bone dry, yet substantial and utterly delicious. Citrus rind, persimmon, strawberry and a hint of chocolate combine, with a lingering graceful finish."
Rosé,"Under the same ownership as Château Roubine, this estate has old vines, some up to 60-years-old. The wine is rich and with concentration as well as a crisper edge. It is full of red-berry fruits, sharpened with red-currant acidity. This is a ripe wine that will be better from late 2017."

The grapes weren't designated for saignee, but rather picked specifically to make this tart and tangy expression of an inviting grape.

Rosé,"This Provençal-style blush is made from Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache. It's a good wine, dry and crisply acidic, but not without its faults. The main problem is a streak of green mint and vegetables. But there's enough sweet raspberry and cherry fruit to get by."

Rosé,"With 45% Mourvèdre and 35% Cinsault this has turned into a highly flavored and aromatic wine. It has great fruits and a rich texture that has a herbal edge. It is certainly a food rosé and with its up-front fruit, it could do with a few months to calm down. Drink from late 2017."

Rosé,"Pretty and pink, this light-bodied but nervy wine brims with white raspberry and pomegranate flavors and a texture that is crisp and mouth-cleansing. The balance between fruitiness and acidity is precise and appetizing, so it pays off sip after sip. It was made from Grenache, Mourvèdre, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc."
Rosé,"Made from Pinot Noir, this is a simple, rather sweet blush wine. It has jammy raspberry and vanilla flavors."
Rosé,"This is a ripe wine, full of red fruits cut with grapefruit acidity.

A hot-pink color and red-cherry aromas lead to bright fresh cherry and raspberry flavors, while a medium body and mild acidity form a smooth texture. Niggli made it from Syrah and Carignane grapes fermented by native yeast."

Rosé,"Closer in style to a light red wine than a traditional dry rosé, this is dark pink—nearly pomegranate—in color, and boasts hints of leather, berries, dried herbs and white chocolate. Textured and round in the mouth, the only quibble is its relatively quick fade on the finish. Drink now."
Rosé,"Domaine de la Mordorée's 2014 rosés are fitting tributes to proprietor Christophe Delorme's final vintage (he died in June 2015).

Rosé,"From one of the classed growths of Provence, this wine is intense with ripe fruits. Red plum, red currant and berry fruit flavors go with a steely, nervy texture that needs to age. Drink from the end of 2014."
Rosé,"Fresh strawberry fruit with a bit of spice makes this an easy choice for warm-weather sipping. Tart, with lemony acidity, it's young and lively. Good as it is on its own, it would make an awesome punch."
Rosé,"This is a “safe” rosé, with nothing outstanding but nothing out of place. It's medium-bodied and round in texture, with notes of stone fruits and berries balanced by crisper notes of underripe melon and a moderately long finish."
Rosé,"This is ripe, round and lush. Cherry-scented goodness leads the way, accented by hints of cracked pepper, cinnamon and allspice that linger elegantly on the finish."
Rosé,"The 18th-century estate that was once painted by Cézanne has produced a ripe, full-bodied wine. It is rounded and rich, full of red berries and some tannins. Age this wine and drink, with food, from early 2016."
Rosé,"Strawberry and watermelon highlight a light, creamy palate of vanilla and lemon peel, the freshness maintained by moderate acidity."
Rosé,"This is a refreshingly fruity wine with a fine balance between acidity and ripe red-currant and raspberry fruits. The wine is crisp, clean and full of fruitiness with a bright fresh aftertaste. Drink now."
Rosé,"An unusually deep salmon color and strong, red-wine flavors tip the scales to the heavy side. This rosé also has more body than is typical, with fruit notes like peaches and cherries shaded by earthy accents."
Rosé,"This is a one-dimensional wine, and it offers confected raspberry and club soda notes that rule the nose and palate. It's light bodied and sweet tasting."
Rosé,"A copper rose hue, this has a strong phenolic grip and a burst of heat at the finish. There's good texture, with wild strawberry and a push toward cherry-fruit flavor, with a wash of citrusy acid."
Rosé,"This copper-colored wine has good, light cherry and apple aromas, and fresh, tangy but lean fruit flavors. It is nicely dry, well balanced and a bit crisp in texture."
Rosé,"Dusty, sweaty, soapy aromas offer little to no fruit. Flat and chunky on the palate, this rosé of Garnacha tastes like nectarine along with the bitter pit. A melony, peppery tasting finish feels hollow."
Rosé,"Aromas of white cherry and strawberry lead the nose of this wine, with hints of peach and honeydew that lend richness. A mentholated thread adds interest to the palate, alongside a soft astringency that couples with notes of melon rind and citrus peel on the finish."
Rosé,"Named after the chapel of Château la Gordonne, which is an historic monument, this wine is a rich rendition of ripe red fruits and a generous texture. It is concentrated, with a tannic edge that gives bite to the aftertaste. It could even age a few months and will be great with the Thanksgiving turkey."
Rosé,"Bottled in a lovely 500 ml bottle, with a label of cut paper with butterflies, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak. It's a beautiful color, a coppery salmon, much like rosé de Provence (where winemaker Virginie Bourgue is from). It's dry and fruity, but more complex than most newly released rosés, with light berry fruits, a lovely texture, and a finish that suggests malted milk chocolate candy."
Rosé,"Sawdust characterizes the nose of this strained rosé. The palate is heavy, resiny and low on acidity, while flavors of forced wood and cream are devoid of fruit."
Rosé,"A composed bouquet of field notes, nettle, tangerine and passion fruit is almost like Sauvignon Blanc. The palate feels lifted and tangy, while flavors of lime, pie cherry and plum skins set up a long, pure, driving finish with cleansing acidity and lasting citrus flavors."
Rosé,"Black cherry notes persist throughout this bluish-pink dry rosé. Ripe white peach, watermelon and plum flavors are punchy and fresh, marked by a razor-edged line of acidity."
Rosé,"This is a soft, balanced blend of Aragon and Touriga Nacional. It has a a bright, fruity character that is both fresh and warm. It's a delicious wine to drink with food."
Rosé,Light pink in the glass with soft aromas and flavors of strawberry and blueberry. Delicate and refreshing; a great choice for hot summer days.
Rosé,"This wine is ripe and balanced, with a tension between the fresh acidity and mineral texture. The red fruits, stylish and attractively bright, bring out the warmth of the south-facing vineyard. Drink now."
Rosé,"Based on Tibouren, a red grape found in Provence, this is a perfumed wine that tastes of the regions herbs and lavender. Both warm and light, it has notes of spice, red plum and a delicate aftertaste."
Rosé,"This Rosé of Sangiovese is light in color and density, with fruit flavors of watermelon and a hint of peach. It's a fine, light and easy sipper."
Rosé,"Rich, full-bodied wine with a serious nature. It impresses with its ripe red fruit, the layer of caramel well integrated with acidity. The feel is soft, but certainly dry, giving an impressive structured aftertaste."
Rosé,"Rosé Chiaretto Pergola (made mostly with Groppello grapes) opens with a vinous note of fresh grapes and raspberry followed by almond skin and white mushroom. It's an easy, no-fuss wine with a zesty, acidic finish."
Rosé,"Red fruits drive this tangy, fruity wine that is given shape by a more mineral texture. With dusty raspberry and plum flavors, it is shot through at the end with citrus."
Rosé,"For a Bordeaux rosé, this is fresh and delicious in a light, fruity style, and immediately appealing. Not for aging, of course, but with a good touch of acidity as well as vanilla. Screwcap."
Rosé,"Pale pink in color, it has a slender body and ample lemon acidity that promise soothing coolness on a hot day. Linear, lemony and very refreshing."
Rosé,"Muted on the nose and palate, with dusty notes of mealy apples, this full-bodied, dry blend of Cab Franc and Malbec finishes with just a whisper of dried cherry and strawberry flavors. Drink now."
Rosé,"The acidity and alcohol are a bit pronounced on the nose, but otherwise this is a drinkable and clean rosé with tart but lively notes of white cherry, rhubarb and cranberry."
Rosé,"The color is dark for a rosé, and the wine is heavy, but then, the blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Pinot Noir. You'll find ripe, strong flavors of raspberries, red currants and vanilla."
Rosé,"Pretty dark, almost plum-like in color, this is a blend of 76% Grenache and 25% Syrah from an estate-grown vineyard in the Foothills. Lots of watermelon in aroma and flavor, the wine finishes slightly sweet, reminiscent of a Shirley Temple."
Rosé,"Bright, light and totally fresh, this is a delightful rosé. It has wild strawberry flavors, laced with acidity. There's some spice as well, giving a balanced wine. It is fine both as an aperitif and with food."
Rosé,"This soft, ripe wine by the Blaye sister-brother team of Marie-Pierre et Pierre-Charles Dartier has caramel flavors integrated into the red fruits. A crisp side comes from red currant flavors, while a smooth aftertaste keeps it rich while not losing the acidity."
Rosé,"A deep pink hue, this boasts aromas of chalk and mineral that accent the red berry and melon core. Flavors of red plum and cherry flesh unfold on the palate, but turn crisp and lifted on the close."
Rosé,"Rich aromas of vanilla custard, raspberry sauce and strawberries and cream immediately waft from the glass and continue through to the round, lush palate. The mouthfeel is a bit flat, begging for more acidic lift to keep the ripe flavors in balance."
Rosé,"Flavors of red fruit, tangerine and a touch of spice all contribute to this open, warm effortthat has light acidity."
Rosé,"This is made from a field blend of Cinsault, Carignane, Grenache, Zinfandel and Viognier. Medium bodied and medium in acidity, it offers a dry, fulfilling tartness of orange, grapefruit and raspberry, remaining light and bright on the palate."
Rosé,"Nearly garnet in color, this offers a very strong strawberry sauce aromas, with appealing hints of shortcake. Fruit flavors suggest pressed raspberry, but there is a shiso leaf bitterness as well."
Rosé,"This progressive domaine in Tavel reaches into neighboring Lirac for this wine, which is a high 70% Cinsault (the balance is Grenache). It's fresh and citrusy despite having ample weight, ending on a zesty note."
Rosé,"From a 100-acre estate formerly the home of the Counts of Provence, this wine has a great fruity character allied to a more mineral texture. With richness and vanilla flavors it is both packed with raspberry fruits and showing structure. Keep until the end of 2014."
Rosé,"A blend of 50% Grenache, 30% Cinsault and 20% Syrah, this is a refreshing and well-balanced rosé. Though young and still somewhat tight right now, it offers bright notes of red cherry, strawberry hull and plum skin that are framed by hints of orange blossom, citrus peel and sweet spice. Silky in texture, with a mineral streak and ample acidity that results in a bright finish."
Rosé,"This is a lovely New York rosé, with its lemon, strawberry and spice nose and its rounded but fresh fruit flavors. Clean but with complexity, it's a sip that can handle richer dishes—think oysters, poultry."
Rosé,"Strawberry with a very faint touch of rhubarb makes for a very inviting nose. The palate continues the strawberry theme with a full, fresh and luscious but dry fruit expression. This is juicy, fleshy and moreish, drink soon."
Rosé,"This is a great option for a widely available and affordable rosé. A very pretty pink in color, it shows baked strawberry, rose petals and vanilla ice cream on the nose. The sip tightens around cherry and strawberry-brioche flavors."
Rosé,"Now sourced from the estate vineyard on Red Mountain, this exceptional rosé includes portions of Counoise, Cinsault and Grenache. Though the pale, coppery pink shade suggests a light wine, this is fragrant and full-bodied, with salmonberry and strawberry fruit, light spice and excellent length."
Rosé,"Oxidized and flat on the nose, this has a palate with mealy, bland strawberry flavors. Nothing changes on a fading, less-than-fresh finish."
Rosé,"A full, rounded wine, very much a rosé for food. It is bone dry in character, although the berry fruitiness gives the wine an attractive open feel. With its firm texture, it could age a year."
Rosé,"This benchmark rosé is round yet fresh, and crisp while ripely fruity. Red berry fruits are finely textured and attractive acidity cuts through the full body of the wine. It would be worth aging until late 2014."
Rosé,"Delicate and pale, this elegant rosé hints at rhubarb and strawberry, dappled with light herbs. Tart and refreshing."
Rosé,"Made from Grenache, Malbec, Pinot Noir and Tempranillo, this is a light, zesty and dry wine. Light copper-pink in color, it is high-toned in grapefruit, plum and peach, completely bright and refreshing. Easy to love from start to finish, it finishes with a twist of tart lemon."
Rosé,"The palest pink grey in color, it is ripe and caramel flavored. Sweet red fruits give a soft texture, full-bodied and rounded. The aftertaste is all fruit."
Rosé,"The color is a deep copper, while aromas suggest chocolate and vanilla, and the flavors are buttery and rich. Together with a thick texture it makes for a full-bodied rosé that will be more of a dinner wine than something for a sunny outdoor lunch."
Rosé,"This rich wine comes from the sheltered vineyards close to Mount Sainte-Victoire. The weight of the ripe fruit gives a full-bodied style with both acidity and a spicy, peppery character. This is a wine to hold for a few months and drink from late 2017."
Rosé,"The difference between this and the brand new 2016 is obvious: this is maderized but still good. Aromas of orange blossom are floral, but overall this seems low on crispness. Plump on the palate, this tastes of peach and dried melon. A soft finish with a white-pepper character says drink right away."
Rosé,"Produced from organic grapes, this is a ripe, full and deliciously fruity wine. It has a good balance between wild strawberry fruits and tight, textured acidity that gives the wine shape. The aftertaste is bright and crisp."
Rosé,"Shimmering with the palest salmon pink, this is a softly scented, restrained but very refreshing rosé. Absolutely dry, it majors on fresh lemon notes with tart inflections of red currant. The slightest fizz helps the freshness even more. Lovely."
Rosé,"The classic skittle bottle shape, familiar from restaurant tables throughout Provence, reflects this wine's character. Lightly peppery and spicy, it has attractive and perfumed acidity."
Rosé,"This nonvintage rosé, modeled after a Bandol, is a blend of grapes and vintages, yet retains superb freshness and offers unusual complexity. Rich and tart, with a creamy strawberry core, it also shows sandalwood highlights and a hint of barrel toast."
Rosé,"Bunan's 18th-century castle is called Belle Raisin—Bélouvé in the old Provençal dialect (beautiful grapes in English). With a range of varieties in the blend, it is an attractively integrated wine that has red cherry, raspberry and crisp apple flavors. It is lively and full of ripe fruits, with just a touch of pepper at the end."
Rosé,"There is plenty of fruit here, but there is also some richness, caramel flavors and a rounded texture that gives a sense of weight. Acidity at the end adds freshness."
Rosé,"Cleanliness is a fleeting quality on this rosé, which smells compromised and artificial. A modest palate feel and dry, hollow, mostly fruitless flavors lead to a bland finish."
Rosé,"A crisp, very textured wine that has red fruits and a salty edge from the closeness of the vines to the sea. It has a mineral texture, grapefruit and raspberry flavors, intense and bone dry. The wine needs food to be at its best."
Rosé,"The bouquet of this rosé is soft and delicate, with subtle notes of strawberry hull, watermelon rind and white-plum flesh. The mouthfeel is light, but with a slight roundness to the midpalate, with a lightly bitter-lime flavor that adds zip to the finish."
Rosé,"This is tutti-frutti in scent, with a pear drop note that is loud and clear. It's light to medium in body, lacking some focus and concentration."
Rosé,"Named after a parcel of land that obviously appeals to blackbirds (merle in French), this is the entry-level rosé of this estate. It is produced from young vines that gives a simple, fruity character with plenty of acidity and a tangy orange flavor. Drink now."
Rosé,"Named after the French author who came from Provence, this wine is a bright, fruity style with pepper and caramel flavors. It has plenty of red fruits and attractive final acidity."
Rosé,"Deep blush in the glass, this wine has aromas of white peach and rose petal. It is full in the mouth, with flavors of nectarine, clementine and lavender. Soft floral notes enhance the bright finish."
Rosé,"This is the top cuvée from Sainte-Roseline (you can tell from the weight of the bottle). It has power, a smooth texture and a rounded aftertaste. The red fruits are well integrated into the rich texture. It would be worth aging this until the end of 2014."
Rosé,"This opens with mealy aromas of watermelon and cherry that smell rich and full. The palate offers a bit more restraint, with focused flavors of tart cherry and berry that are framed by prickly acidity. The finish is short, but crisp and mouthwatering."
Rosé,"A red-fruit-dominated rosé that is full of bright fruits and a smooth texture. It has acidity to balance the ripe nature of the wine. This style is really for food, ripe and rich in the mouth."
Rosé,"The 18th-century estate that was once painted by Cézanne has produced a ripe, full-bodied wine. It is rounded and rich, full of red berries and some tannins. Age this wine and drink, with food, from early 2016."
Rosé,"A dry rosé, dominated by caramel and raspberry fruit flavors. It has attractive acidity, but the texture does feel heavy, leaving a dull aftertaste."
Rosé,This blend of Shiraz and Castelão is in a soft and ripe rosé style. There is just a touch of tannin from the Shiraz to give weight. The aftertaste is lightly sweet.
Rosé,"There are extreme amounts of citrus on the nose of this bottling, particularly reminiscent of fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, as well as an edgy, crushed slate minerality. The grapefruit character explodes on the sip, which is very refreshing, unique and compelling."
Rosé,"A warm blend mainly of Grenache with Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is typically pale in color, with just a touch of tannin from the Cabernet. A spicy undertone balances with the deliciously crisp and fresh red-fruit character."
Rosé,"Pale salmon-colored, this is all Cabernet Franc. Aromas of herbs, flowers and green pepper are followed by bone-dry flavors that linger."
Rosé,"This blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay is orange in color and smells neutral except for a note of orange peel. On the palate, this has a grabby skins-driven texture. Short flavors of stone fruits are chunky and clunky. Other than having a mild flavor of nectarine, the finish is neutral."
Rosé,"This is a full-bodied, ripe wine from one of the top Provence estates. It is rich with red-berry fruits and has been given a crisp touch from the tangy peppered acidity. The spirit (Esprit) of Gassier is obviously in good health."
Rosé,"A dry rose, the color of onion skins. The Austrians describe the aroma as “sweet tart” because it suggests freshly baked, butter-sweetened pastry crust. It drinks startingly dry and rasping, with citrus flavors and acidity that will make your mouth water.  —S.H."
Rosé,This rosé—a blend of Tempranillo and Grenache—is light on flavor. A thin note of watermelon and a hint of peach pit quickly fade.
Rosé,"This is a rich wine that is full of spicy aromatic fruit. It is classy and elegant while having some weight. Red fruits and orange zest are given a perfumed herbal edge from the Mourvèdre in the blend. This is real food wine, ready to drink."
Rosé,"A pale salmon-colored rosé, this is largely Cinsault (60%), with the rest a blend of Grenache and Syrah. It's more minerally than most, with canteloupe and pomegranate fruit and a minerally finish reminiscent of smoky quartz."
Rosé,"Cantaloupe aromas lead to a fresh palate with snap. Nectarine and tangerine flavors run lean and clean on their way to a juicy, no-nonsense finish."
Rosé,Wood aging (hence the extra year before release) gives this wine richness and a smooth texture. It does take away some freshness but the ripe red fruits give a rounded character that puts the wine firmly in the food-friendly category.
Rosé,"This wine lives up to its name in the pure, perfumed flavors that are an enticement for sipping. An edge of tannin and lemon zest liven the wine even more. The tight, bright acidity at the end is mouthwatering."
Rosé,"This estate obviously believes in experiments, presenting here an apéritif-style blend of Syrah and Muscat. It's not hard to taste the strongly perfumed Muscat character, which dominates the palate. Ripe with more spice than fruit, it's ready to drink."
Rosé,"Notes of crushed stone and restrained melon fruit combine in this medium-bodied rosé. It's a pleasant quaff, with a clean but abbreviated finish."
Rosé,"An astoundingly characterful rosé, the Mordorée Tavel has a hugely complex nose of cherry, carnation and strawberry set against a backdrop of herbes de Provence. Intensely flavorful in the mouth, this wine finishes on a long note of lemon zest and white cherries. An excellent foil for roast pork."
Rosé,"The popularity of rosé has lead to higher prices in Tavel, but this estate, one of the region's largest, has kept those increases in check. Thankfully, the wine quality seems as good as ever, with this 2013 offering deep cherry-berry notes, hints of white chocolate and a long, citrusy-clean finish. Drink this full-bodied rosé now and into fall and winter 2015."
Rosé,"This wine is fruity and crisp, with attractive balanced acidity. It's all about raspberry and red currants. A refreshing character gives citrus tang to the aftertaste."
Rosé,"Aromas of field brush and citrus are a touch funky. This Monastrell rosé feels round and pulpy, but with decent acidity. Citrus flavors, both pulp and peel, lead to a briny-tasting finish."
Rosé,"This is a tangy, spicy wine, a character that makes it seem dry and textured. It has weight as well as great fruit and acidity. With its citrus flavors, the aftertaste is fresh while still tangy."
Rosé,This is a textured wine that's rich and round. Its citrus and red berry fruits are balanced with a spice and caramel character.
Rosé,"A crisp, clean, deliciously fruity wine. It's light, fragrant, touched with red berries and attractive acidity. There's no complexity here, just pure fruitiness and freshness."
Rosé,"Following the latest Provence fashion in having a glass-stoppered bottle, this wine is the top of the range for this producer. It is soft and ripe to start but deliciously balanced and crisp at the end. Named after Madeleine or Mado, an imaginary Provencal lady, the wine is ready to drink."
Rosé,"If you are of the school that says rosé from Provence is the world's gold standard, then give this excellent newcomer a try. Brief skin contact has created a light color and sense of elegance on the nose and palate. Flavors of cantaloupe and peach are lightly sweet but cut by ample acidity. Drink as soon as possible to capture this wine's fresh essence."
Rosé,"This pale pink rosé is 100% Cinsault--an oddity in the Rhône, where so many wines are blended. It's only moderately weighty and rather crisp, with tart, citrusy notes and hints of underripe stone fruit, giving it a straightforward, linear appeal."
Rosé,"A light fragrant blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Cão, the wine is soft with plenty of strawberry fruitiness and acidity. The aftertaste has a great lift of perfumed crispness."
Rosé,"Produced from the organic vineyards of Les Baux, this wine is pale in color but full of fruity flavor. The blend is Grenache (50%), Cinsault (30%) and Syrah (20%). It has a crisp, mineral texture that's tangy and fragrant with white flowers and red currants, giving it delicious apéritif style."
Rosé,"Smoky flint and crushed mineral tones contrast concentrated raspberry and strawberry flavors in this richly concentrated rosé. Full bodied and supple in texture, it's sturdy enough to accompany heartier fish and fowl dishes far beyond the summer months. Sunny acidity brightens the finish."
Rosé,"This is a soft, rounded and ripe wine. Attractive raspberry fruits are filled out with a light tannic character. The freshness and acidity do cut the full texture although perhaps not enough. Drink now."
Rosé,"Light and bright, this is a perfumed wine. Its very present acidity is underpinned by spice, red-currant fruits and a tangy, tangerine aftertaste. Drink now."
Rosé,"Pink and light, with a sharp nose that's sweaty and sour. The palate is quite strong in acidity, so there's razor-like sharpness and spiky flavors of grapefruit and early season red plums. Overly zesty and tart; made from Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot."
Rosé,"A light orange-colored rosé, it's equally light on the palate. It has lost its freshness while broadening out into a softly fruity, orange peel and strawberry flavored wine. It needs food."
Rosé,The wine is light and fruity—properly crisp with attractive acidity. The red fruits shine through the light texture and touch of spice creates a bright wine full of final fruitiness.
Rosé,"This wine from Houchart's selective Sainte-Victoire appellation is distinct from the Quiot family's other Houchart rosés. This wine is rich and full on the palate, without losing any sense of acidity or freshness. It's ready to drink although it will be better from the end of 2015."
Rosé,"Zesty aromas of bramble and alpine strawberry are laid across an underlying chalkiness and graphite minerality, making for an inviting yet well-structured nose on this Grenache-based pink wine. Ripe strawberry and hibiscus notes show first on the palate, which rides a tense, chalky line, presenting flavors that are persistent but not overpowering."
Rosé,"This blend of two-thirds Syrah and one-third Mourvèdre is fresh and aromatic, showing some peppery-gingery spice to go with watermelon and strawberry notes. It's medium in body, with an abbreviated finish."
Rosé,"Perfumed and bright, this is an attractive blend that includes Pinot Noir and Syrah. With its ripe creamy texture and exuberant red fruits, the wine is ready to drink."
Rosé,This wine comes from one of Côtes de Provence historic cru classé estates. It is a ripe and smooth wine with crisp acidity and a fine bite of spice. The wine is packed with red fruits and finished with refreshing acidity.
Rosé,"This flamingo-pink wine comes across as a bit confected, with bubble-gum aromas and flavors of cherry and melon. It's a simple but clean fruit-driven rosé to casually quaff during warm weather."
Rosé,"This is fairly hard and fiery on the nose. The palate is tough and the wine smacks around rather than flows easily. With only modest acidity, it's not that lively."
Rosé,"This vigorous blend of Grenache (60%), Cinsault (20%, Tibouren (10%) and Syrah (10%) has a good balance between rich fruits and the freshest acidity. While there is a crisp, tangy background, the foreground is ripe with strawberries and apricots. The whole thing is finished with a lively, bright aftertaste."
Rosé,"While the nose is quite bold, boasting concentrated notes of strawberry leather and caramel, the palate on this delicately framed rosé is demure. It's a bit light in concentration with soft acidity, but an easygoing quaffer for early consumption."
Rosé,"Bardolino Chiaretto is an elegant and delicate wine with pretty highlights of rose, raspberry and sweet cassis berry. The wine shows a soft, yielding nature in the mouth with a touch of crisp acidity on the close."
Rosé,"The caramel character of this wine is less attractive than its background of red fruits. The two sides need to come into balance for it to work completely, so wait until late 2016."
Rosé,"All Merlot, this pale-pink wine offers aromas of herbs, grass and cherry. Though the label suggests otherwise, it drinks off dry, with pit-fruit flavors."
Rosé,"This is a delicious, perfumed and fruity wine. It is crisp and clean, bright with acidity and ripe in raspberry flavors. This wine is a perfect summer quaffing rosé."
Rosé,"Pink fruited and light, with an attractive herbal character. The crisp acidity cuts right through the rich mouthfeel.Bright and lively, the finish has a grapefruit note that lends lift."
Rosé,"The wine is round and full in the mouth. The acidity gives a fresh character to the ripe caramel flavors that shine through the light texture. It is a wine that needs food, with its lively acidity giving a dry, mineral aftertaste."
Rosé,"Picturesque with a crystalline salmon color, it begins with the scent of just-bitten nectarine. The following flavors of tart apple and a slightly bitter salinity ensure the uniqueness of this wine. Mourvèdre (57%) is in the lead, followed closely by Grenache (28%) and Counoise (15%), all coming from the original cuttings of the Château de Beaucastel. This age-worthy blend will be fun to track 2017–2019."
Rosé,"This pale-hued blend of Grenache and Syrah starts off a bit confected, offering up scents of cotton candy. Yet it's less so on the palate, where the fruit resembles underripe melon and the finish is stony and less generous."
Rosé,"Simple, fruity wine, crisp, clean, laden with red fruits and touched by vanilla. The wine is light, fragrant and totally ready to drink."
Rosé,"A little heavy and soft, with jelled raspberry, cola and vanilla flavors. The finish turns sugary."
Rosé,"Made in a more savory style, this shows hints of nutty, putty-like aromas alongside cantaloupe and citrus. It's medium in body, with a dry, earthy finish."
Rosé,"Very fresh, light and a little candylike in flavor, this vivid-pink wine is dry and fruity. It is charming and easy to sip."
Rosé,This is a lightly sweet wine with candy flavors and an attractive touch of acidity and an orange zest backdrop. It's ready to drink now either as an apéritif or with spicy food.
Rosé,"A blend of co-fermented Syrah (60%) and Viognier, this wine is a very pretty pale copper color with just a tinge of salmon. It offers nuanced aromas of pear, strawberry and white flowers. The palate is dry and fresh, sleek but with depth and texture to the fruit flavors."
Rosé,"With a light caramel taste, this is a fat while still fruity wine. Salmon pink in color, it has acidity that fits behind the ripe red plum flavors. It should be drunk now."
Rosé,"Green herb and cut-grass notes lend a fresh purity to this Cabernet Franc rosé. Sprightly in body, with fresh, citrusy acidity, it would pair beautifully with herbaceous Thai or Vietnamese cuisine."
Rosé,"From the region of La Londe close to the sea, this wine is warm and ripe, with rich strawberry flavors that are almost jammy. A touch of pepper and spice calms down the freshness. Probably this wine will be better as an apéritif."
Rosé,"Tastes a bit on the sweet, sugary side, but with the crisp acidity, it's balanced and elegant. The cherry, raspberry, lemongrass, vanilla, peppery spice and smoky wood flavors will work well against Thai or Vietnamese fare."
Rosé,"Cut with sulfur, this is a wine whose bitterness hides the potential of the strawberry fruits and acidity. Off-dry, it's unbalanced."
Rosé,"There is a great burst of appealing acidity in this wine, accompanied by refreshing red fruits. This balanced wine is lively, crisp and with plenty of flavor. Drink now."
Rosé,"A rosé of Sangiovese from southern Tuscany (Montalcino), Lo Sbrancato features ripe aromas of wild berry, cranberry and white almond. It's a simple, fresh wine that would pair well with mussels steamed in cream sauce."
Rosé,"The palest salmon-pink color sets the scene for a lightly fruity wine. It has caramel, raspberry and crisp pear flavors. Pure fruitiness makes it refreshing and ready to drink."
Rosé,"Grenache, Cinsault and Syrah form a soft warm blend that is ready to drink. It has acidity and spice as well as red berries. It's a fine apéritif style with its light touch and final crispness. Drink now."
Rosé,"This rosé boasts a pale flamingo-pink hue and slightly acrid aromas upon opening. But it settles down to present tart, cranberry-like fruit and ample weight allied to a taut, fresh mouthfeel."
Rosé,"Ripe and full, soft in texture and rich. The wine has spice along with the red apple, apricot and sweet strawberry flavors. The softness takes the dryness away."
Rosé,"Bubblegum aromas send this wine in a candied direction. It is soft, not quite dry, with ripe strawberry flavors. It tastes confected although the acidity at the end does keep it fresh."
Rosé,"Faint notes of red currant and rhubarb appear on the nose. The palate is fresh and light, combining lemon and berry freshness with earthier notes. This is slender, dry and very refreshing."
Rosé,"Light and fruity, this is full of strawberries. The wine has a fresh character with a light touch of pepper and spice. It's attractive, bright and ready to drink."
Rosé,"Laced with really crisp fruits and red-currant flavors, this is a brightly fruity wine. Lively and with a tight texture, this is ready to drink."
Rosé,"A fresh rosé, so crisp, bright and lively. This is real pleasure, the red berry fruits bursting out of the glass, lifted by delicious acidity. Very crisp, pure in taste."
Rosé,"Mild citrus, melon and peach aromas are clean. This wine feels solid and a touch plump, but with agility. Peach and melon flavors are simple, and it's fresh, tasty and fairly elegant on the finish."
Rosé,"The extra year gives this wine quite different flavors from the forward fruitiness of Provence rosé. It now has a richer, more complex character and weight of ripe fruit, caramel and vanilla flavors. This is a serious, food friendly rosé."
Rosé,"Named after a green oak (Eouve in the local Provencal language), this wine is brightly aromatic, with a caramel flavor and tight acidity. The 15% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend has given the wine some structure, which needs to soften a little. Drink from late 2017."
Rosé,"A little soft and one-dimensional, with raspberry and cherry cola flavors. Lacks the liveliness that a rosé needs. No oak on this dry wine."
Rosé,"The Cabernet Sauvignon grape really comes through on this rosé from Paso Robles pioneer Justin. There is strawberry shortcake at first, but the Cab's capacin-led aromas of green bell pepper are prominent. The pepper carries through to the palate, in a very intriguing, tasty way, offering balance between berry fruit and green bitterness."
Rosé,"This is full, soft and a little heavy. It's condensed with sweetness from the rich fruit and misses some crispness."
Rosé,"An attractive pale-salmon color, this 100% Cinsault rosé opens with soft scents of strawberry, pear, melon rind and earthy spice. The palate is lush, with fleshy fruit flavors that are balanced by ample acidity and a soft tannic astringency on the close."
Rosé,"Caramel and soft fruits in a wine that seems to be missing the zesty, crisp element. The wine feels flat."
Rosé,"Shelton leaves the organically grown Carignane grapes she uses for this wine on the skins for three days, resulting in a dark velvet-red color that's followed by flavors of ripe strawberry with a twist of watermelon. Smooth and easy drinking, enjoy before a meal, on a picnic or with light, springtime fare."
Rosé,"Crisp, bright, strawberry-flavored wine that has some weight and spice to it. It shows ripe fruit as well as vivid acidity, freshly balanced with red currant aftertaste."
Rosé,"Deep pink in color, this blend of 42% Syrah, 30% Grenache, 11% Cinsaut, 11% Mourvèdre and 6% Counoise offers light strawberry and pomegranate aromas on the tightly wound nose. Bountiful, refreshing acidity powers the palate, but the flavors are sparse, just hinting at sour raspberry and pomegranate."
Rosé,"Light and fruity, the wine comes from the sandy soils of the Camargue Rhône-delta region, known for its rugged, indigenous horses. The wine is crisp with acidity and has a bright touch of red currants. The wine is dry, refreshing for an apéritif."

Rosé,"With its extra-dark rosé color, Clairet is an unusual style. This wine is juicy with some acidity alongside fresh raspberry fruits. At the end, the wine seems heavy."
Rosé,"Whiffs of watermelon and spring blossoms abound on the nose of this dry Merlot, vinified as a white wine. Crisp yellow-cherry and citrus flavors are a bit more delicate in concentration on the palate but its vibrant acidity is refreshing."
Rosé,"This crisp and fruity blend is dominated by 80% Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is bright with intense, refreshing acidity and a lively aftertaste. Drink now."

Rosé,"Ripe and full, this wine is balanced with its rich strawberry fruit, with enough acidity to keep everything fresh. It's a fruity, spicy wine that is ready to drink."

Rosé,"Beautifully crisp and light, this is an ebullient wine that is full of lively red currant and tangerine fruits. There is attractive acidity, a bright aftertaste and plenty of acidity. Drink now."
Rosé,"A blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Mourvèdre, this is an invitingly juicy and spicy rosé, packed with strawberry-mint and pomegranate flavors and a long, savory finish. It's a great introduction to this winery and its talent for creating Rhône-inspired wines."

Rosé,"This is an attractive, simple and, yes, an easy wine to drink. It has a pretty orange-pink color, crisp citrus fruit and the freshest final acidity."
Rosé,"This wine balances between the sweetness of a Rosé d'Anjou and fresh, crisp fruitiness. It makes for an attractive wine that's both full of red fruits and that has a light texture."
Rosé,"Fragrant, fresh, young and zippy, this is a simple, fruity summer rosé. The nose expresses only citrus but the mild palate shows some of the cherry-ish roundness of Zweigelt. Its light body and full fruit make it the ideal light refreshment. Drink as soon as possible."
Rosé,"This is a ripe, plump rosé that's highly “smashable,” as young Aussies would say. Mixed red berry fruit is underscored by a dash of lime on the finish. Drink now."
Rosé,"Pretty dark for a rosé, and heavy in the mouth, with the density almost of a red wine. Shows soft cherry and spice flavors."
Rosé,"Red apple, pink rose petals and orange-laced bubblegum combine for a light and refreshing nose on this delicate, Pinot Noir-based rosé. There is good energy and verve to the sip, which is nearly effervescent at first, then delivers slightly sour watermelon, strawberry and red-plum flavors."
Rosé,"This wine is a unique in the state blend and features Cinsault (35%), Grenache (35%) and Mourvèdre. Pale peach in color with a slight bronze tinge, the aromas are light, with notes of strawberry, citrus zest and mineral. The flavors are dry, sleek and high acid. It's a perfect summer wine."
Rosé,This is a finely balanced wine. It is dry with its red fruit right to the fore. The acidity and the tangy texture both promise some further aging. This is a great food-style rosé that will be good to drink from late 2017.
Rosé,"A pinkish copper color, light cherry and raspberry flavors and a smooth, rounded mouth-feel make this full-bodied wine easy to sip and enjoy."
Rosé,"This is hardly a fashionable color for rosé, deep and almost like a light red wine. It tastes heavy, although the red fruits are cut by ample acidity. The finish is rich and ripe."
Rosé,"This rosé is done by the saignée method, bleeding off excess juice from the fermenting tanks. It's 48% Syrah and 52% Cabernet Franc, yielding a hard-edged yet buttery wine with lightly peppery, watermelon flavors. Not for everyone, but distinctive."
Rosé,"Made entirely with the native grape Bombino Nero, this informal light-bodied wine has subdued aromas of wild cherry and a hint of crushed herb. The aromas carry over to the über-simple palate along with a hint of pink grapefruit."

Rosé,"Clean and fresh on the nose and palate with hints of fresh gooseberry, apple and red plum, Waters Crest's rosé could use a boost of concentration on the midpalate, but it's a simple, easygoing rosé for casual entertaining. Finishes tart, with a brisk, sour cherry note."

Rosé,"Some barnyard flavors give a rustic character. Fruit and acidity are there, leaving a wine with a crisp aftertaste even if not losing the rougher element."
Rosé,"A solid rosé that brings to mind bistros, steaks and pommes frites. Grenache provides the flavor background of cherries, while Barbera brings a firm spine of acidity. Finishes bone dry. A delightful and useful blush wine."
Rosé,"Another of the cool wines from Gassier, this has herbal aromas, considerable acidity and green apple and vegetal flavors. It's perhaps too light, too cool for its own good."
Rosé,"This is a vibrantly rich wine that is brimming with delicious red fruit notes and bright acidity. Full and concentrated, it has weight without being heavy. It is a finely made wine, with a crisp finish."
Rosé,"Attractive aromas of sweet grass, melon rind and baby's breath lead the nose of this dainty wine, with supporting fruity nuances of white raspberry, cherry and peach. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing, with pleasant acidity and a juicy, mouthwatering finish. Enjoy this quenching rosé now."
Rosé,"This very pale rosé from Syrah master Andrew Murray shows Pink Lady apple, cantaloupe and spun sugar scents on the nose. It's very fresh on the palate, with lively acidity that cuts through the riper cantaloupe and other melon flavors on the midpalate. Chalky texture raises it above many other rosés."
Rosé,"Stalky, sulfuric and oaky on the nose, then plump on the palate, this rosé from Valdeorras is made from Mencía, not one of Spain's normal rosé grapes. This tastes woody and like sawdust, with generic red-fruit flavors, sugary sweetness and vanilla on the finish."
Rosé,"Pretty pink in color, this wine is inviting in aromatics, offering a depth of fresh strawberry and watermelon atop a substantial mouthfeel of body and weight. It finishes balanced and dry."
Rosé,"A particularly fresh and refreshing wine, with the cleanest acidity, attractive red fruits and grapefruit juice. A great apéritif style. Screwcap."

Rosé,"Extra fruity, packed with strawberry and crisp red currants flavors, this is all freshness, richness and clean acidity. It has some weight but this just emphasizes the fruitiness."
Rosé,"This rich and impressive wine has structure and a firm texture, partly from the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend (45% Grenache, 35% Syrah, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon). It is dense and full of juicy red fruits, caramel and delicious spice. Production is only 2,500 cases. It would be worth aging for a few more months, so drink from late 2015."
Rosé,"A soft, almost off dry wine that is full in the mouth. It has caramel and spice flavors as well as light acidity. The wine feels weighty and definitely needs food."

Rosé,"Ripe bramble, crisp strawberry and cherry perfume this full-bodied moderately concentrated rosé. Dry in style, it's easy drinking with a slightly candied cherry-cough-drop finish."

Rosé,"A terrific California blush wine, rich and compelling, with a gorgeous color, sort of a salmon-koi gold. It's bone dry and crisply clean in acidity, with strong, but not heavy, flavors of strawberries and raspberries. There's a dusting of tannins that give the wine a solid structure."
Rosé,"Light in color, this gently fruity wine offers a touch of caramel as well as red currants. It's made to drink young and fresh now."

Rosé,"Dominated by toasty, coconutty aromas, with just hints of peach and hazelnut. Hold six months and see what emerges; right now, this wine is defined more by technique (barrel-fermentation and aging) than terroir."
Rosé,"Aromas of yeast, grape skins and dust are less than compelling but not offputting. This is a high-acid, shearing type of rosé, tasting citrusy and a bit sour. A mild orange flavor is found on a crisp, racy finish."
Rosé,"A very light shade of pink, this blend of 49% Grenache, 19% Grenache Blanc, 13% Mourvèdre, 12% Carignane, 4% Cinsaut and 3% Roussanne offers wet river stones, strawberry, peach and pluot on the nose. The palate is quite subtle, with nectarine, brioche and airy watermelon flavors. Altogether it's very clean and fresh."
Rosé,"This salmon-colored rosé is made from the País grape, a.k.a. the Mission Grape. On the nose, it's a cypher with weak fragrances of peach and mango. The palate is cidery and hard in feel, while briny, tart citrus flavors are pithy and fail to evolve or improve on the finish."
Rosé,"A fruity, strawberry-flavored wine, with crisp acidity to balance the ripe fruit. It's a clean and refreshing rosé, ready to drink now."

Rosé,"This blush is a blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Cinsault, from the estate vineyard in the Santa Ynez Valley. Tart and spicy in strawberries and cherries, with something exotic, like papayas, it's a lovely rosé. Versatile with so many different foods, and the price is fair."
Rosé,"The wine is soft with a warm caramel and spice character. That contrasts easily with the red-currant fruits and lemon zest acidity. It is a clean fruity wine, ready to drink now."
Rosé,"This is a simple but appealing rosé, defined by strawberry fruit, hints of chalk dust and a mouthwatering finish."

Rosé,"This lightly wood-aged wine, from an estate that has only changed hands three times in 400 years, is crisp, tight and very young. It has fine potential for the future.

Rosé,"The cave cooperative in Tavel is hitting on all cylinders, turning out numerous consistent, top-rated examples. Différent doesn't have the spicy nuances of the very best Tavels, but it offers a bold, ripe mouthful of raspberry and cherry fruit, ample weight and richness and a long, slightly dusty-textured finish. Drink now–2018."

The pristine palate offers more of the same, with additional hints of melon rind and peach skin that lend some bitterness and texture to the finish. Well balanced and refreshing; drink now."

Likewise, the flavors have plenty of juicy red wine notes like cherry, raspberry and earthy spices, and it balances well between good acidity and creamy viscosity. It can almost substitute for a red wine, and will add depth to occasions with equally flavorful food."
Rosé,"Véronique Barthe is the first woman to manage the estate that has been in the Barthe family since 1789. She delivered a light and bright wine, poised and stylish with its crisp fruit and tangy acidity. A delicious burst of citrus at the end continues the theme of this fruity wine."

Rosé,"Dusty mineral and earth tones lend a savory feel to delicate cherry and red-plum flavors in this pale pink rosé. Bright, fresh raspberry-lemonade acidity bristles on the palate."
Rosé,"Minty and light, the fruit here does not seem to have obtained optimal ripeness, even for rosé. Scents and flavors suggest pine needle and wintergreen rather than any hint of berry or melon."
Rosé,"This 100% Malbec rosé brings out a charming side to this sometimes tough grape. The bone-dry wine is fruity, deliciously crisp and with intense red fruitiness. Named after the owner's daughter, Julie Perrin, it comes from young vines. The wine is very ready to drink."
Rosé,"Pale in color, this crisp wine offers a touch of yeastiness that contrasts with the red-currant fruits. It has plenty of bright acidity as well as a tangy, zesty aftertaste."

Rosé,"Full-bodied for a rosé (as Tavel should be), this wine boasts plenty of cherry-berry fruit, but also appealing, complex notes of fresh thyme, ground clove and aniseed. Drink this blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Cinsault, 10% Syrah and 10% Clairette (a white grape variety) over the rest of 2017."
Rosé,"The second rosé from Vignelaure is a delicate, fruity wine, with attractive acidity to go with its orange and white fruit flavors. The finish is smooth, with just a tang of lemon zest."
Rosé,"Vines planted on steep, terraced slopes around an 18th-century château give a dense and warm wine. While the acidity is very present, bringing out lemon and orange flavors, the spice and pepper give the wine its complexity and its still-young aftertaste. Drink from 2016."
Rosé,"Aged for six months in wood, this is a rich rosé. The wood aging shows in a toasty edge, although the wine is just as much about crisp red fruits. It has a tight texture and structure, a mineral edge and citrus fresh aftertaste."
Rosé,"Raspberry, bubble gum and rhubarb aromas get this pink-tinted rosé off to a solid start. Juicy and smooth on the palate, this tastes of citrus fruits, pineapple and red plum. Bright acidity ensures that this is lasting and fresh on the finish."
Rosé,"Red-berry fruits dominate this crisp, clear wine with its direct line of acidity and light aftertaste. It's aromatic and full of life."
Rosé,"Maderized and stalky smelling, with a scratchy palate and grassy, pickled flavors that lean toward strawberry and raspberry."
Rosé,"This blush tastes like a peaches-and-cream soda, with hints of strawberries and vanilla. It's soft and mellow, with a honeyed finish."
Rosé,"This wine is half Syrah with the rest Cinsault, Grenache, Counoise and Mourvèdre. Aromas of red apple, watermelon and bubblegum are followed by lighter tart, lightly spritzy fruit flavors, with the acid pulling it all together on the finish."
Rosé,"To call this rosé deep is an understatement. In color and body, it's almost a red wine. But it does have the silky delicacy of a blush wine, and is frankly delicious in cherry jam, red licorice and Dr. Pepper flavors. It finishes thoroughly dry, and the acidity is racy."
Rosé,This is a smooth wine with rounded fruit and light acidity. It has refreshing red-berry fruits that give softness while also finishing with a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.
Rosé,"This lively wine comes from the Clarence Dillon group (Château Haut-Brion). It offers good balance between the considerable acidity and the red-berry fruit. With its spicy background, the wine is delicious to drink now."
Rosé,"The wine is crisp, bright with acidity and red-currant fruits. It has weight while also having an intensely crisp texture. Its aftertaste and rich texture are lifted at the end by a shot of citrus. The wine comes from the estate of a 19th-century family-owned chateau."
Rosé,"Cherry and plum aromas are light, generic and clean. This feels mostly right, with moderate acidity creating a solid mouthfeel. Plum, citrus and herbal flavors finish round and balanced."
Rosé,"In its singular oval bottle, this is the top cuvée of this prestigious estate close to Saint-Tropez. It is a lively and fruity wine with great acidity and richness. It has spice as well as red-currant and raspberry fruitiness. This is definitely a wine for food, with its edge of structured acidity and bone dry aftertaste. Drink from late 2017."
Rosé,"Kind of dark in color for a rosé, but dryish, crisply acidic and fine. A blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah and other varieties, it's as full-bodied as a red wine, with tangerine, strawberry, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors."
Rosé,This wine is 100% Sangiovese and is a pale pink color. Aromas of cherry bubblegum and herb lead to a dry full-feeling palate. The alcohol pokes out a bit at times but it still provides enjoyment.
Rosé,"Crisply light and fresh, this is a bright and clean wine. It's just touched by vanilla that goes well with the refreshing acidity. No complexity, just easy drinking. Screwcap."
Rosé,"A collaboration between winemaker Austin Hope and Texas chef Tim Love, this yellow-pink bottling is light and delicate on the nose, with buttered croissant, lime and flinty aromas. The palate is light and very quaffable, with red apple and light pencil-lead minerality."
Rosé,"This is a bold-flavored, medium-bodied rose. It starts with a bright pink color, then shows effusive floral and fruity aromas and jammy but dry flavors."
Rosé,"A pale, dry wine, this is crisp and lightly textured. It has a bright lemon character as well as red-currant fruits. Produced in the hills behind Saint-Tropez it is named after the painter who had strong connections with Provence. Drink this wine now."
Rosé,This is a sweet and soft rosé. It has perfumed red-berry fruits that are given a lift by the acidity. The finish is fresh while sweet.
Rosé,"Herbal and spicy, this wine has bitter vegetal flavors that don't accord with the acidity or texture."
Rosé,"Complex and rich, it has ripe red fruits that are full of sweetness as well as some fresher acidity. With red plum, minerality and vanilla, it can age for a few months. Wait until 2015."
Rosé,"A cheerful nose of raspberry, strawberry and lemon starts this rosé blend, and like flavors follow in layers that offer substance beyond the typical rosé. The wine has a touch of sweetness and a more unctuous mouthfeel than the nose might suggest, giving it the weight to pair with more complex dishes. Overall, an affordable, elegant choice."
Rosé,This is a soft wine with attractive ripe strawberry fruits and a soft texture. There is balancing acidity giving an edge of freshness to the otherwise gentle fruity texture.
Rosé,"A pale pink color, this clean, refreshing rosé offers nuanced notes of strawberry hull, white melon rind and just-ripe peach on the nose and mouth. The bright, juicy palate is zippy and refreshing, with lively acidity and citrus-driven flavors that carry through to the mouthwatering finish."
Rosé,"This impressively concentrated wine focuses on the brilliant red fruits that shine through the generous texture. It is ripe, with a streak of fresh acidity at the end to give the essential refreshing aftertaste."
Rosé,This wine is so soft it is almost without taste. Only the acidity remains.
Rosé,"A ripe style of wine, typified by its caramel element and full, spicy fruit. With its weight, it should pair well with food."
Rosé,"Produced from Niellucciu, this wine is ripe, perfumed and also packed with crisp acidity. Fresh raspberry, citrus and a touch of caramel are brought comfortably together by the acidity and zesty aftertaste. Drink now."
Rosé,"A wisp of a wine that's dark-salmon in color, this is made entirely from Grenache grapes grown near the town of Davis. It's dry, light and fun, offering a strawberry and watermelon fruitiness, with a trace of spice on the end."
Rosé,"This Syrah-Merlot blush has a pretty color, but there's not much going on, flavor-wise. It tastes like alcohol and acidity, with a tiny splash of cherry flavoring."
Rosé,"Bone dry, wonderfully fresh and loaded with strawberry and watermelon flavors, hepped up with lightly peppery spice. In short, a perfect summer sipper, chilled and drunk with picnic foods, preferably outdoors."
Rosé,"In Provence, heavy bottle seems to equal high alcohol. It's true here, with a wine that, while it has the right pale grey pink color, is almost too rich for its own good. It does have fruit and acidity but they are just a part of a powerful and ripe wine. Age it until the end of 2014 for best results."
Rosé,"This well-balanced wine is poised easily between ripe red fruits and some light tannins. It has great spice, attractive perfumed acidity and great style. Touches of pineapple give a more tropical character to the aftertaste."
Rosé,"There's a pleasantly light, silky texture on this pretty rose-gold colored blend. It has rich flavors of red cherries, persimmons and spices. One thing to know is that it's quite sweet, like sugared tea."
Rosé,"The maraschino cherry-like aromas of this pink wine evoke a delicious Shirley Temple cocktail, with touches of lemon-lime soda and raspberry. There is solid acidity and grip to the palate, as well as red apple and wet slate flavors."
Rosé,"Dry and crisp in acidity, this has pleasant raspberry, rose, tobacco and spice flavors. Try pairing this with salty, cured meats, like ham and sausage."
Rosé,"Bone dry and very acidic, almost sour, with watery flavors of orange and lemon cough drop candy. Gains a few points for elegance and cleanliness."
Rosé,"Like so many Provence wines, this is made from organically grown grapes: Grenache and Cinsault. It is fresh and light, with a crisp, poised texture that gives an attractive tang and lifts the red fruits. It is fruity and ready to drink."
Rosé,"With its delicate onion-peel color and rather subdued aromas, this rosato appears older than it is. The palate is a bit more expressive and slightly fresher, offering suggestions of tart apple and sour cherry before finishing on a bitter note."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A seriously good wine, showing how well this warmish appellation can develop Sauvignon Blanc in a cool vintage. The wine is dry and lively in acidity, with subtle, complex citrus, tobacco and white pepper flavors. Very versatile at the table. Production was just over 1,000 cases, but it's worth a search."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A straightforward, nicely priced wine offering mid-weight texture amidst grapefruit, lime and peach flavors and aromas. It's an easy-to-like quaffer for summertime or to enjoy before meals."
Sauvignon Blanc,"For a large-production wine (47,000 cases made), this is nice and easy to drink. Tropical fruit aromas are lightly citric. In the mouth, this is fresh and easy, with nectarine and tangerine flavors. Freshness and simplicity are this wine's calling card."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With 5% Riesling in the blend, this bone-dry Sauv Blanc gains just a touch of roundness and spice. Clear, crisp flavors mix celery, gooseberry and tart melon fruit. It's very fresh, almost delicate."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Cool and green smelling, with briny notes and whiffs of green pepper and sea foam, this shows intensity, while the flavors veer toward lime, passion fruit and green herb. It's nervy and tasty on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine is flashy and there's no denying that, starting with a heady nose of toast, smoke and orange peel. The palate is viscous and grainy on notes of mint and ginger, with barely enough acidity to maintain balance. Nonetheless, it is inherently appealing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The unique nose of this wine shows crystalline lime candy and nectarine flesh, along with a sharper yet plush tangerine blossom aroma. The palate plays the cut-grass note with pride, offering bell pepper, jalapeño, green peppercorn and kaffir lime flavors, sewn together with a tightly wound acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Entropy only made 30 cases of this SB, sourced from the Blanches Vineyard in Livermore Valley. It's a tad thin, made in the grassy style of the variety."
Sauvignon Blanc,Prickly aromas are short on fruit. This is a streamlined SB with spritz on the palate. Lean citrus flavors are briny and slightly bitter on the finish.
Sauvignon Blanc,"This lovely blend of Sauvignon Blanc, and 14% Roussanne, is as crisp and fresh as its name implies. Bright fruit flavors of lemon, lime, orange and pineapple speak to the success of this unusual blend. It's a bracing, palate-cleansing white wine that will be appealing all year round."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A tiny bit of effervescence dissipates quickly. Classic aromas recall dried lime peel, wet cement, cut grass, sliced apples and a touch of rosemary oil. The palate holds extreme grassiness along with Anjou-pear peel, pine and thyme, reminiscent of a dewy lawn in springtime."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a waxy, rather soft rendition of Sauvignon Blanc, and the pretty fruit flavors mix grapefruit, citrus and pineapple. There is very little suggestion of Sauvignon Blanc's herbal or grassy side; the grapes seem to have been ripened past that point, though not all the way to California-style, tropical fruit flavors. All in all this is a well-crafted, smooth and flavorful wine, with a portion barrel-aged for extra complexity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Half fermented in neutral oak and half in stainless steel, this offers a bold, generous take on the variety. The fleshy, creamy taste of crème brûlée and Meyer lemon compote is full bodied and somewhat shy in acidity. It finishes tangy and somewhat salty."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Among St. Clair's 2009 range of block Savvies, this is among the sweatiest, with pungent nettle and almost-asparagus notes on the nose. Yet on the palate, the wine is full-bodied, round and concentrated, with nectarine and honey elements punched up by bright herbal tones. Long and intense on the finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Seems old due to mild vegetal aromas infiltrating the wine's core aromas of banana, vanilla and melon. Still zesty in feel despite 2011 being the current vintage; tastes of mature orange, grapefruit and pith, with lime on the finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From sandy soil above the banks of the Cher river, this wine has crisp citrus and clean, bright white berry and lime flavors. There's a refreshing herbal aftertaste. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Herbaceous in aroma, this crisp and dry wine tastes fresh and lean—typical for a Sauvignon Blanc. It smells like parsley and thyme, is lemony and medium bodied on the palate, and has a tangy finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Gaseous aromas settle on saline, chlorine and gritty citrus. This is round and not overly acidic in feel, with pickled, briny, green-leaning flavors of lime, cucumber and bell pepper."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine seems sweet and refreshing, with juicy flavors of orange, apricot and peach, leading to a spicy finish. It's polished and drinks well now; try it with Asian fare."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Spicy, minty and sharp, this has a Sancerre-like edge, but with an extra weight to the fruit that is more reminiscent of like a South African Sauvignon Blanc. It's packed with green pea, herb, lemon and lots of citrusy flavors, all set against very sharp, bright but delicious natural acids."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Light straw to the eye, this wine offers aromas of pineapple, grapefruit and cut grass. There is a nice balance of citrus and herbal notes on the taste buds, with flavors of pear, peach, lemon and chopped parsley and basil. It has a bright, fresh finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,A simple Sauvignon Blanc that tastes of cantaloupe. Serve it at a big outdoor party or any other time the focus is not entirely on the wine.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of orange blossom and pineapple juice are not substantial. In the mouth, this is chunky and plump, with oily peach and nectarine flavors mixed with some green bean. A heavy finish with little spine provides minimal cut and freshness."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of freshly mowed grass, lemon pith, and lemon grass open for mineral-driven flavors of Bartlett pear, lemon juice and green apple in the midpalate."
Sauvignon Blanc,Slight spritz and a very restrained nose of subdued fruit lead onto a fresh but rounded palate where lime zest encounters riper notes of passion fruit. There is a more serious midpalate texture that calls out for food. Drink soon.
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine's expressive aromas and flavors of sweat, green herbs and passion fruit all speak of the Dillons Point subregion, but those excesses are toned down by aging in 1,000-liter oak casks known in German as fuders. That aging has imparted a pleasant creaminess to the midpalate, again mellowing the regional character."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Neutral smelling except for some pear and mild apple, while the palate is tangy and linear, with citrus, lemon and green apple flavors. Clangy and ringy on the finish, but solid all around. Drink soon or wait for the upcoming vintage."
Sauvignon Blanc,"If you like yours big and burly, then this might be the right wine for you. Applesauce and lemon meringue pie aromas lead the way toward a palate full of lemon, pineapple, tangerine and vanilla. The finish is stony and leaves a custard-like impression. It's clearly from the barrel-fermented school, but for some that may be fine. For others, however, it will feel overoaked and ponderous on the tongue."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Grapefruit spray and gooseberry aromas jump from the glass initially, with an herbal tomato-leaf tone lingering behind. Lemon-lime acidity cuts through the medium-bodied palate of underripe peach and tropical fruit, leading to a talc-dusted finish. This is zesty, lively and perfectly enjoyable as an apéritif or paired alongside tangy cheese."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Relatively light in body, with pungent overtones of boxwood and asparagus. This is a bit on the green side of the spectrum, only partially balanced by citrusy fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of lemon meringue pie, lemon grass and caramelized pineapple open to flavors of wet river rocks, lemon zest and lime pith. Bright finish with strong minerality."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The flinty silex soil is reflected in the steely flinty texture of this wine. It lies under the crisp and nervy white and citrus fruits. The result is a wine that is under tension, still young and needing time to open up with its full potential. Drink from late 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Mild citrus aromas come with green notes. This is a medium-level Sauvignon Blanc without a lot of acidic snap. Melon and grapefruit flavors are friendly, simple and chunky, while overall this shows characterisitcs of a warm, bland vintage."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From selected parcels on this estate, this wine is rich and with great intensity. It has a flinty character that will allow it to age. Its apple and citrus fruits are balanced by the concentrated taut texture and finished with acidity. Drink this wine from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's a nice, juicy, lip-smacking tang to this Sauv Blanc, like biting into a not quite ripe peach or a lemon drop. It's a good mix of citrus, steel and stone. A small amount of Sémillon in the blend adds weight to the midpalate."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a bit vegetal on the nose, where nectarine aromas compete with greener notes of canned beans and asparagus. In the mouth, this is oily in feel, while flavors of green fruits trend toward herbaceous. A minerally finish with citrus flavors and herbal leftovers is what you'd expect."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A textbook example of Washington Sauvignon Blanc, this is bright, racy, juicy and vibrant, with an array of crisp, clean fruit flavors. Citrus, grapefruit and pear are all in the mix, accented with notes of sweet grain from aging in new oak."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine is fruity and soft, with hints of citrus and herbal flavors. Its acidity is bright and attractive. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a ripe wine, with wood aging that has smoothed the fruit intensity while keeping the rich apple and pear flavors. An unmistakable tang of minerality comes from the youthful texture. With its dense character, it's a wine to age. Drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fleshy and fruity, fresh and full bodied, this generous wine offers scents of orange peel and citrus, and the palate exudes ripe flavors of grapefruit, lime and a hint of melon."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Curiously dusty wine, tasting of under-ripe cranberry with a coating of sweetness. While it is identifiably Sauvignon Blanc, it does seem to have missed out on the region's signature minerality. Screwcap."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The mint-green bottle color presages the minty flavors of this dry, crisp wine. The fruit feels delicately balanced between underripe and fine, with suggestions of white peach and mango. It shows some real complexity, and the all-important acidity is wonderful."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Offering great value white, this is 90% Sauvignon Blanc with 10% Sémillon. It's bright and intensely flavored, first with pineapple followed by a flash of grapefruit and layering of vanilla. A crowd pleaser and food-friendly quaff."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A heavy dose of Sauvignon Blanc brings herbaceous, grassy, white currants and gooseberry flavors. It's young, and needs more time to coalesce. It is certainly fresh, fruity, right up front."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine needs food so much, it practically cries out loud for it. It's like the essence of lemons and grapefruits, in a bone-dry, crisply tart package that makes the taste buds sing. The oak has been kept in the background to emphasize the clean, racy flavors, although partial sur-lie aging adds creamy notes. Oysters and this wine would be a marriage made in heaven."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is the third vintage of a wine from a single parcel of ungrafted vines, produced in a walled vineyard within the ruins of the Sancerre city walls. The vines are a selection from the family's Les Romains vineyard. It cannot be labeled Sancerre because of the experimental methods used in its production. The wine is young, needing to age to develop its concentrated fruits and rich apple and apricot flavors. Tight and tense at this stage, it will develop slowly. Drink this rare wine from 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This single-vineyard wine has benefited from the warmth of 2015. It is rich, full bodied and veering towards tropical fruits. There is a contrast with the steely texture that keeps crispness in the wine. It is now balanced and ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With 12% Sémillon in the blend, this is a lovely, fresh, almost exuberant Sauvignon Blanc. Bracing and textural, with good varietal character but no excessive herbaceousness, it's loaded with fruit flavors of melon, grapefruit, kiwi and apple. A fine mix of precision and length."
Sauvignon Blanc,"One whiff says this hails from a warmer region like Maule as opposed to someplace cool and coastal. The aromas are tropical more than zesty, with notes of mango and banana. On the palate, this is round but acidic enough, while flavors of tangerine, grapefruit and lime wind down well."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This shows the sharper, more herbaceous side of the grape, though perhaps without being fully ripe. It seems to fall away quickly into simple lemon juice flavors, with a hint of herb."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An intensely herbal wine, this is very green and crisp. It brings out citrus, fresh apple and lemongrass spiciness to yield a wine that is concentrated and likely to age for 2–4 years. Glass stopper."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The strong herbal edge to this wine has more to do with its youth. Behind that lies rich apples and ripe pears cut deliciously with acidity. The wine is full and will benefit from more aging, so drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Produced in the typical flinty (silex) soil of parts of Sancerre, this wine has a crisp steely texture that is balanced by the ripe yellow fruit. The combination is both taut and ripe, giving good balance and tension. Drink this wine from 2017 to allow it to develop further."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of tropical fruit and lime are restrained on the nose. The palate is soft and a bit flabby, with papaya and yellow-apple flavors that become more pithy and bitter on the easy finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a herbaceous wine with dominant green fruit, followed by acidity and fine flavors of sweet currant, kiwi and thyme. It is fresh and ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The bouquet is neutral except for a spot of lemon-lime. The palate is clean and balanced, with decent weight and fresh acidity. Flavors of green fruit, scallion, mineral and herb fall off on the finish. Drink immediately."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A blend of four of the best parcels from the Saget estate, this is a rich and structured wine. Its apple, citrus and yellow fruit flavors are just beginning to integrate with the tight, steely texture. Drink this wine from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Coldstream Hills is better known for its Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs than its Sauvignon Blanc, but this is a solid effort. It's medium in body, with simple grapefruit and pineapple flavors and a crisp, clean finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Minerally on the nose but also slightly pickled, with a wet but basic tasting palate that is a touch dilute as it deals grapefruit and lime flavors. Finishes clean, fruity and a bit sweet."
Sauvignon Blanc,"this medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc shows only a bit of grassiness. Rather than green, it offers predominantly pineapple, grapefruit and even a touch of stone fruit, finishing with a citrusy flourish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Still young, this has fine potential. As it matures, the ripe gooseberry and apple fruit notes will open up to yield a rich, complex and mineral wine. It will always have a tight texture along with vibrant acidity to finish. Drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Hugely rich and in a seriously heavy bottle, this is a statement wine. Its texture is there, surrounded by superripe fruit and touches of pepper from the alcohol. This almost tropical-fruit wine needs to age a little longer, so drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Soft grass, green gooseberry and a hint of fig unfold on the nose, while ripe green plum and lime rind fill the medium-weight mouth. Clean and easy to drink; pair with crab salad canapés."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This ripe wine is full of citrus fruit, gooseberry flavors and fully integrated acidity. The crisp background is beginning to fill out and soften. Attractive freshness contrasts with the rich fruits and spice aftertaste."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This fresh, crisp wine has plenty of lively citrus fruits that are enriched by red apple and zesty orange flavors. The wine is already delicious in its fruitiness and ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Light and easy with a great lift to the green plum, hard guava and banana notes. Lively but not overly zippy or mouth-puckering on the finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The best Sauvignon Blanc yet from Shaw & Smith, the 2009 boasts terrifically fragrant aromas of passion fruit and pink grapefruit. It's intense and long, easily the qualitative equal of its top Kiwi cousins and better than most. Drink now–2011."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Soft, waxy apple skin, verbena and lime leaf aromas unfold on the nose and carry through to the medium-minus-weight palate. This is well-balanced and easy to enjoy, with medium acidity and a hay accent on the finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Grassy, slightly green aromas are fresh and suggest cactus pad. This is easy on the palate, with flavors of citrus fruits and green herbs, such as tarragon and rosemary. A crisp finish is just solid enough to maintain integrity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Dryish and crisp, this shows citrus, lemongrass, herb and honey flavors, with a sweet bitterness that will play well with a wide range of food, especially modern Asian fare."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Minerality and passion fruit aromas control the bouquet. The palate is fresh and zesty, with grapefruit, lime and green apple flavors. Holds its form and tightness on the finish, staying juicy and fresh from front to back."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Demure on the nose with hints of dust, smoke and dried herbs, this is a dry, decidedly savory style of Sauvignon Blanc. It's crisp and spry on the palate with pleasant lemon-lime flavors, but finishes briskly."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A hard-driving, ultragreen nose oozes pure bell pepper. A plump palate with cutting lime-like acidity adds zest and sharpness to vegetal citrus flavors. Packed to the brim with pyrazines, this is about as green as SB gets."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a softly gentle wine, with a drop of Sémillon contributing an oily, cashew earthiness to Sauvignon's citrus and tropical fruit flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Raised in stainless steel, without oak infuence, this wine is rich, savory and dry. A small percentage of Pinot Grigio brings a note of green apple to the flavors of citrus, white flower and honey."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine has the lightest possible taste. Its hints of green fruit, light, citrusy acidity and crisp aftertaste are barely discernible. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Loved the 2008 but at this point in time I can't say the same about this bottling. It's vegetal, with heavy bell pepper and asparagus aromas and flavors. Low-volume zest and kick indicates that it has turned; best to wait for the 2010 because this is too green and flat."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Dusty stone-fruit and white-flower aromas are mature, while the palate is linear and citric. Dry salty flavors of pineapple and tangerine finish with notes of mustard, lemon and brine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This SB delivers citrus peel, grass and other common varietal aromas. The feel is a touch flabby and soft despite modest acidity, while flavors of citrus fruits and green herbs finish round and long."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This has a soft texture that just allows room for some crisp apple flavors. Otherwise, it is a smooth rounded wine. Its fruitiness and its acidity are part and parcel of this ripe wine. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Shows the brilliantly etched fruit and brisk acidity that mark an Edna Valley white wine. Tremendous in citrus and wintergreen flavors, its mouth-cleansing quality makes it ideal for an appetizer. Or try with Asian-style poultry and pork dishes."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tropical in style and approach, this rich wine dotted in pineapple and papaya drinks bigger than it is, veering into very ripe flavor and texture."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Gritty aromas of sulfur and matchstick come with citrus and field-like scents. A round but lively palate with lemon and sulfuric bitterness finishes green, briny and juicy. This wine is plump and oily, but with enough zest to maintain balance."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A lovely Sauvignon Blanc whose crisp acidity cleanses the palate, and whose dry finish leaves it stimulated, not cloyed. Shows subtle, tart lemon and lime flavors, with a minerally tang. A super bargain."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's a ripe orange-oil streak in the background of the bouquet, boosting rich aromas of tropical fruit and hay. The texture is full but framed by cleansing acidity and a tart, slightly pithy accent on the close."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A bit austere, this is an undeniably crisp offering. Delicate herbal notes accent underripe pineapple and white grapefruit, then end on a dry, stony note."
Sauvignon Blanc,"What a nice wine. It's so dry, acidically crisp, and so balanced, it puts many more expensive California Sauvignon Blancs to shame. There's no oak in this screwtopped wine, nothing to muck up the pure, fresh citrus and fig flavors. The winemaker has allowed high natural acidity to remain, which makes everything ultraclean and savory."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This light-bodied wine smells fresh and tastes refreshing. It has lemon and herb aromas, delicate citrus flavors, good acidity and a lively mouth-feel."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A fine, concentrated, mineral-textured wine, with pink grapefruit and lemon zest flavors. It is vivid, fresh, layered with crisp acidity that blooms in the mouth. There is a great, taut aftertaste."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a vegetal SB, no two ways about it. Aromas of canned beans and peas are greener than Ireland. Flavors of asparagus, canned peas and citrus finish soft, with low acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Pungent and sweaty smelling, with nettle and other sharp aromas. Surprisingly, the palate is short on acidity so there's a flat feel along with green, salinic flavors that border on vegetal. For proof, there's a clear wave of asparagus to the finish. Not as good as in past years."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Though labeled Sauvignon Blanc, this includes 20% Muscat, which makes it more of a proprietary white wine than a pure varietal expression. The flavors combine grassy, salad greens with citrus and grapefruit rind. The Muscat shows up in the orange blossom highlights. As the low alcohol would suggest, this dry wine has plenty of natural acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From the home vineyards of the Saget family, this a warm and generous wine. While endowed with many green Sauvignon Blanc characteristics, the tropical fruit style makes it feel rich. As it ages, it will offer even more complex flavors. Drink from 2015."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Inviting floral notes open the aromatics of this wine. These evolve into a thick palate of melon and citrus, the finish light and high in acidity. Straightforward and balanced, it's a quaffer."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Gritty citrus aromas are tight and crisp. This is wet, basic and zesty on the palate, but lean. Flavors of citrus, green herbs and brine finish with a mix of bitterness and notes of tangy green apple and passion fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"More fragrant than herbaceous, this is a rounded, creamy wine. It has creamed pear, apricot and ripe lime flavors to go with the smooth texture and finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Produced from old vines in Verdigny, this is rich while still totally crisp. Ripe yellow and white fruits, apricots and apples are cut with acidity and a taut, mineral character. While this wine is ready to drink, it will improve for some time, and will be better in 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Maybe a little more ripe and heady than some of its Chilean buddies, but this SB from Montes offers freshness, zip and good citrus, tarragon and other green-herb flavors. The feel is good, the character fresh, and the finish long and clean. Offers maybe a little more green-leaf character than some might like, but overall this is another fine value SB from Chile. Drink immediately."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Once principally known for its reds, Domaine Vacheron's whites are increasingly important. This 2006 domaine wine is ripe, with intense mineral flavors and pink grapefruit which edges to tannins and green apple skins. Classic Sauvignon Blanc, very pure."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A very nice wine for the price. It's bone dry and high in acidity, with a crisp tartness that's just what you want in Sauvignon Blanc. The flavors are pleasant, of oranges, citrons, limes and green apples."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An irresistibly drinkable white wine, filled with the juiciest flavors of citrus fruits, fig, melon and peach, and just the tiniest bit sweet. Crisp acidity cleanses the palate and leaves it feeling minty fresh on the long, spicy finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The Sauvignon Blanc here creates a wine tasting of ripe pineapples and kiwi fruit. It is rich and full bodied with spice, perfume and attractive acidity. The wine is developing still and will be better starting in 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lime and green-apple aromas are tight and stony. Bright, juicy and chiseled on the palate, this tastes of wet stones, lime and bell pepper. Citrusy residual flavors along with a note of bitter citrus pith make for an honest finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Varietally correct, with familiar prickly aromas along with citrus and sweat. It's pretty much all you could ask for at under $10, and with honest lemon and pineapple flavors its committed and alive. Good mouthfeel with grab and body only secures its standing as a white wine Best Buy."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A chalky textured and mineral-driven wine, it's crisp while also smooth and rich. It is full of white fruits, softly textured herbaceousness and lively final acidity. A wine to age for a few months or even a year or two. Screwcap."
Sauvignon Blanc,Wheaty white-fruit aromas lack pop and clarity. This feels round and fairly juicy due to its acidity. Lime flavors are tempered by a bready yeasty note and fall off quietly on the finish.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Clean, modest lemon-lime aromas open this citrusy Sauv Blanc. Citrus, nettle, white pepper and jalapeño flavors are direct, while the finish hums with peppery spice and preserving acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The flint soil of the vineyard shows in the steely, mineral character of this wine. It is all about structure at this stage, subduing the citrus fruits that are developing. It will fill out over the next few months, so drink from late 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A sweet succulence of white peach stars in this full-bodied, well-built and ripe wine. Plush on the palate, it rewards in a freshness of acidity that balances its richness."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Opens with a mix of minerality, citrus and powdery white fruit scents. The palate packs tang and zest, while the flavors of green apple and lemon are lean, crisp and citric through the finish. Fresh but a little sharp and monotone."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisp and dry, this is a medium-bodied, slightly austere wine. Hints of smoke or stuck flint join with grapefruit rind on the nose, while a slightly bitter note appears on the palate and persists through the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Only mildly herbaceous, this is a soft, gentle wine. It has ripe apple and peach fruits, juicy acidity and an attractive perfumed character. The wine is still young, so give it a few months."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The aromas are light with notes of herb, citrus and tropical fruit. The palate is a bit more generous, showing pleasing herb and tropical fruit notes accented by tart acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From a single vineyard on flinty silex soil, this is a taut and concentrated wine. Its intensity is enhanced by the tense texture and powerful youthful acidity. At this stage, it is still young, still with its exuberant fruit. So wait to drink this wine until 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sourced from a region along the eastern coast of the South Island, this is fresh and greenish on the nose—think green onion, cut grass, lime—yet riper-tasting, offering hints of stone fruit and melon. It's a pleasant mix that finishes soft and easy. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Clean and composed SB, with lemon-lime aromas that settle more toward lime. The palate is clean, with basic depth that allows for nice green apple and dry green-herb flavors to show themselves. A little weak on the back end, and very “liquid” due to medium concentration."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Earthy and dry, this single-block designated white is fresh in cut grass and hay, with a tropical edge. Composed and steely, especially on the finish, it provides plenty of richness balanced by classic acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"All from Rosebud Vineyard, this moderately aromatic wine brings notes of herbs and pineapple, with Sémillon (15%) adding fig to the mix. The concentration doesn't seem all there and it needs a bit more acid to stand it up."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Soft, bland aromas of applesauce and herbaceous green fruits lead to a jumbled, acidic palate that's awkward and scouring. Green flavors of lime and grass finish tangy."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine shows how well Sancerre can age. While the initial herbal fruitiness has calmed down, the citrus and green fruit is still vibrant and crisp. The fruit has been joined by a touch of spice, pepper and a hint of toast from the partial wood aging. Drink this wine now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The vines, rare in the Wachau, were planted because the family liked to drink Sauvignon Blanc, a simple explanation for a wine that is fresh, green and balanced between herbaceousness and tropical fruit flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Cool-climate pyrazinic aromas are punchy and feline. This feels good but weaker and more dilute than in most years. Briny, pickled citrus flavors follow the nose, while this ends lean and green but solid enough."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A controversial wine that will have its fans. Dryness and acidity make it a little sour, and a medicinal taste invades the citrus and tropical fruits."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A very subdued nose precedes an equally tame palate. However, there is fruit at the heart of this and its innate freshness is balanced by supple mouthfeel and subtle aromas. The finish is clean and refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lemon, pineapple and spice aromas, followed by flavors of crisp citrus and rounded gooseberry mean this wine can pair with myriad dishes. A deft, elegant touch—with the trademark Elgin freshness and minerality—keeps the fruit from heaviness. A fun, clean wine with food pairing character."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fresh and forward, with aromas of pine, lemon and pear. The mouth is rather lush, but hardly fat. There's clean flavors of pineapple and banana, and then comes a sharp, tangy finish. This is proof that Chile can produce good Sauvignon Blanc for immediate consumption. –M.S."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From cellars in the heart of the village of Pouilly-sur-Loire, the seventh generation of the Masson family produces this classic Pouilly Fumé, structured and full of ripe fruits. It is a wine for aging, with its tense minerality and tight texture that parallel the fruitiness. Wait until 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a juicy, succulent and high-toned wine aged in both stainless steel and French oak. From a site rich in volcanic soils, it exudes a flinty, stony element that's incredibly compelling, accented with passionfruit and grapefruit flavors and driven by lengthy acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tart lemon verbena is highlighted in taste and aroma in this structured, elegant and zesty wine. Textured and medium bodied, it finishes with some graceful weight."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A blend of vines from different soils, this rich, dense wine has concentration as well as steely, tangy fruits. It is still young and nervy, needing time to open out. Drink this wine from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This Trentino Sauvignon is surprisingly rich and viscous, coating the mouth with mixed fruit flavors, including tangerine, lime and pineapple. Despite the rich mouthfeel, the flavors linger delicately on the finish, giving an unexpected feeling of elegance. Best Buy."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A mix of melon, tropical fruit and passion fruit aromas lead to a tight palate with just enough body weight to not be austere. Flavors of white pepper, citrus and celery are modest on the finish, which tastes briny."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A tremendous effort from Spy Valley, this easily eclipses the winery's regular Sauvignon Blanc. Fig, melon and hints of vanilla mark the nose, while the palate amps up the citrus component, providing delineation to the nectarine flavors. It's on the full side of medium-bodied, with a silky, slightly creamy texture and a lingering finish that seamlessly blends citrus and stone fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Quiet on the nose and 100% inoffensive. The palate hints at bell pepper and green bean while also dealing ample pineapple and citrus. Turns a little tart and lean on the back end, but that frames the wine's freshness, zest and energy. Another good Sauvignon Blanc from Chile that's made to drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The rarely used Atlantique appellation covers much the same region as Bordeaux, with less stringent rules. This 100% Sauvignon Blanc wine is fruity, easy, soft and full of citrus flavors. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine shows what a fine place Dry Creek Valley is for growing Sauvignon Blanc. With no oak at all, it's clean and brisk in citrusy acidity, with refreshing peach, lime, green grass, tropical fruit and spice flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Veteran Kevin Judd has turned out another fine effort. Passion fruit and pea tendril aromas impart a welcome green edge that's never overwhelming, picking up layers of white grapefruit on the plump, medium-bodied palate. The finish is intense, long and citrusy."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This stainless steel-fermented wine opens with white flower scents and grassy, herbaceous notes, following up with tart lemon and melon on the palate."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A little bulky and maybe just beginning to fade. This is a rounder and chunkier specimen than the 2008 Cipreses SB, and it shows softness at its core and hints of green bean and bell pepper. Fortunately, holdover acids and green-fruit notes bring it back to higher ground. Drink immediatelyor wait for the release of the '08 vintage."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A fantastic Sauvignon Blanc. Tastes as fresh and vibrant as a young wine can, with exuberant flavors of pineapples, green apples, cloves, vanilla and cinnamon that are wrapped into a rich, creamy texture. Crisp acidity makes the wine brilliantly clean. With the exception of the '04, an off-vintage, this bottling has been wonderfully consistent."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A mix of Sauvignon Blanc (77%) and Sémillon, this wine comes from three separate vineyards in the Columbia Valley. It shows plenty of Sauvignon's herbal character while also displaying the ripeness of the vintage, with lightly spritzy tropical fruit and fig flavors that possess a fleshy feel."
Sauvignon Blanc,"More oak than the wine can handle is what you get here, from the woody, buttery overtoasted nose through the soft, clumsy, creamy body.  It's a real challenge to find any fruit, so you had better like a fully wooded wine if you're going to take a crack at this one."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Round and soft, it offers apples, citrus and gooseberries enveloped in a full-bodied texture. An edge of steely background suggests it's a wine for some aging, so wait until 2015."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Match stick, tropical notes and green banana aromas make up the nose. This is dilute in feel, with a hint of generic tropical fruit. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There are aromas and flavors of pine and fresh herbs in this medium-bodied, crisp and tangy wine. Lemon and lime notes kick in on the palate, and the good acidity keeps the finish fresh."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A soft, almost sweet version of a typically more crisp varietal, this is fruity, smooth in texture and uncomplicated. It has fresh citrus and apple flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A piney, minty, earthy aroma and citrus and herb flavors make this light-bodied wine appetizing. It's dry and well-balanced and has plenty of personality, so drink up."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This crisp tightly woven white is showy in fresh-cut grass and gooseberry flavors, with an underlying grasp of grapefruit and lemon. The texture is gritty."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is the top wine from Balland, who is based in the Coteaux du Giennois further north. Taking its name from the limestone pebbles in the vineyard, it is textured, mineral and zesty. Crisp lemon and warmer green plums give it tautness and add a richer element. Drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of herb, grass, pear and citrus lead to sleek fruit flavors. It shows a lot of elegance but lacks concentration."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Plump but wholly generic, with semisweet aromas that are neither here nor there. The palate is round, with adequate to good mouthfeel. And the flavors of citrus are solid but kind of pithy and bitter. A full, chunky wine with virtues as well as some flaws. Drink right away for best results."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Gently herbaceous with a character that also allows room for a creamy texture, this is a refreshing wine with a crisp edge, always in moderation. Drink this fresh wine now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Produced from 60-year-old vines, with some new wood aging, this complex, ripe wine has an intense structure, with layers of vanilla and spice. The crisp nature of Sauvignon Blanc adds brightness to the ripe roundness. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Creamy vanilla and pear give this white a decadent edge, brought back to earth by its integrated acidity. The use of oak is not overdone and there's body and structure to spare, along with tropical-leaning flavors of papaya and pineapple."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisp and glossy, this refreshing, stainless-steel Sauvignon Blanc has the appropriate varietal flavors of fresh herb, sweet grass, lime and grapefruit. The flavors of citrus and herb are in perfect balance and complement each other perfectly."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is one of a range of three wines from different soils. Silex soil is flinty, giving, as here, ageworthy, structured wines. It is dense, powerful and with a range of steely textures that dominate the very crisp, taut and nervy fruits. Drink this from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A full spectrum of Chilean SB aromas are present, from grass to citrus to tropical fruits to vegetal notes. This feels fresh but more or less regular. Flavors of green fruits come with grassy interjections, while the finish is good and clean."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Soft and rounded, this is a wine that shows its ripe fruits upfront. It has a lightly textured character along with some spice for added interest. The aftertaste is fresh and crisp."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sharply defined with fruit flavors of melon and green berry, this has real cut and drives through the palate with confidence. It's a great food wine, neither wimpy nor too assertive, and it's made to be chilled and set out with any white-wine-friendly food."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A mild Sauvignon Blanc, with white grapefruit, grass and mild asparagus aromas. Feels chunky and round, with soft acids creating sweet, green flavors of grapefruit and grass. Round on the finish, with a modest variety of flavor."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is potent in lime, sweet lemon, Asian pear and tropical fruit flavors, brightened with zesty acidity and enriched with notes of mineral and vanilla. Beautiful to drink, it will pair with everything from Thai food to risotto."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Punchy prickly citrus aromas are clearly that of Sauvignon Blanc. Light in color and weight, this tastes of tangy citrus with a shot of black and green pepper. Lime is the key flavor noted on a clean but mild finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Not sure what has changed at Isabel, but the wines seem to lack the excitement of past vintages. The 2007 is oddly neutral, with waxy overtones to the grapefruit and lemon flavors and a slightly bitter note on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Wild flowers and a touch of rubber make for a bouquet that at first is hard to appreciate. With air things improve, and the palate that follows is full of tart gooseberry and citrus. Racy acidity really drives the citrus onto the finish, so much so that the wine leaves you with a one-dimensional impression: that of citrus and acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The aromas of citrus peel, herb and mineral are light and elusive. The palate offers medium-bodied tropical fruit flavors that stretch out on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Green aromas blend with coastal-influenced passion fruit, while the palate is driven by citrus, pineapple, passion fruit and some unfortunate canned vegetable flavors. Acidic and racy, but not much nuance or character. Shows the Leyda style of SB but not in blow-out form."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The aromas of this fresh, tangy wine are like parsley, garlic and lemon, and the flavors add in tart grapefruit and green tea notes. Lively, assertive and refreshing, the wine will shake up cocktail hour or a seafood course."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisp and sturdy at this young stage, with a lot of green on the nose: apple, onion, melon, even celery. For a Maule Valley SB, this one manages to maintain freshness and liveliness. There's give and take between the wine's acidity and body, with apple, green herb and talc for flavors. Finishes clean and chalky."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Floral and exotic, the tingling acidity in this wine is the standout, but it's equally buoyed by a mouth-filling texture adorned by a sensation of fresh-squeezed lime and grapefruit. Balanced, this lovely Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc should convince one and all of the variety's regional merit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Named after the Tyto Alba, the barn owl that lives in the forests around the vineyard, the wine shows a tropical fruit side of Sauvignon Blanc. Mango and pineapple dominate the ripe character of the wine. It is aromatic, just hinting at something more herbal. Drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A grassy, green wine, although with some weight and richness filling out the fresh fruitiness. It's soft, showing lemon and red apple fruits but with a crisp final taste. Screwcap."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Intensely herbal, this is a crisp, cool wine. Layers of citrus, grapefruit and gooseberry mingle with grassy, herbal flavors. Green, fresh and drinkable now, this is a fine apéritif style."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A full, soft Sauvignon from close to Sancerre. There is a light, yeasty character to this young wine, but the fruit is all there—fresh pink grapefruit, lime and green berries. The finish is acidic and crisp, but still mouth-filling."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Extremely tight and herbal aromas of cut grass, chives, scallions and oregano ride a fascinatingly rainy cement minerality on the nose of this fresh and vibrant bottling. The wet-cement flavors show powerfully on the sip, with lemongrass, wild lime leaves and more mowed-lawn touches."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisp green aromas suggest lime and then passion fruit. It's lively and spritzy in the mouth, with high acidity yielding green flavors that transition to pithy and heavy. Lemon-lime mixed with celery notes come up on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Unmistakably Sauvignon Blanc, it carries notes of herbs, citrus and guava. It's lightly spritzy and drinks dry with mouthwatering citrus flavors. Try it with shellfish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A riper, more mature and rounded aspect characterizes this Sauvignon Blanc. Creaminess and texture align themselves with the fresh acidity. There are smoky, flinty notes in the background and the fruit notes remain in the fresh citrus spectrum. They linger beautifully on the finish. A balanced, grown-up wine destined for the table."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tomato leaf features on the nose and palate of this wine, a characteristic of the Awatere Valley (a subregion of Marlborough). Gooseberries provide a fruity base to this medium-bodied wine, but fade quickly on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A little sweet and easy up front, with aromas of air freshener and tropical fruits. The palate is round, lightly spritzy and endowed with flavors of apple, lime and kiwi. Long and quite fresh on the finish, with a hint of lasting sweetness."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Shows more gooseberry and feline notes than previous vintages, but there's still enough sweet spearmint and pink grapefruit flavor to satisfy. The acidity is lovely and mouthwatering."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An aroma like fresh mint leaves and sage leads to lively, crisp lemon and lime flavors in this very refreshing wine. It has just the vibrant palate-cleansing qualities needed."
Sauvignon Blanc,"After years of tinkering with Sauvignon Blanc, Grgich Hills has finally produced a truly notable bottling—its best ever. This is lightly oaked, clean and delicious, with tart, lemony acids that provide brightness to the green apple, lemon, lime and pear flavors. The finish is honeyed and spicy."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Off-dry in taste, this wine has an intense sweet-and-sour flavor. It didn't undergo malolactic fermentation, so there's plenty of green-apple-like acidity, and as it partially fermented in barrel, there is a vanilla-cream-like sweetness. This will pair well with Asian fare, ham or sausage."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Clean, clear Sauvignon, as fresh as can be, but with some fatness to it. There are good gooseberry and green herb flavors, only the lightest of textures. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Radiator dust and Animal Cracker aromas are not typical of Sauvignon Blanc. On the palate, this opens with mild citric notes but quickly shifts to flatness. Pithy orange and apricot flavors finish yeasty, with a distant hint of citrus zest."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc boasts a slightly oily texture to go along with decently intense aromas of stone fruit and fresh herbs. Flavors of pineapple, currant and tomato leaf provide a good introduction to Marlborough Sauvignon. Imported by Five Gold Hands."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Neutral up front except for green apple and mineral aromas. Feels quite good and healthy, with juicy acids pushing fresh bell pepper, lime and white peach flavors. Short but fresh and citrusy on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A very pale color, aromas of white pepper and fresh fennel bulb, tropical fruit flavors, good firm acidity and just a touch of sweetness to balance that tartness all add up to a flavorful, lively and light-bodied wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Initially this wine smells buttery and nutty from oak influence, which morphs into notes of bruised yellow apple and very ripe melon. The palate is more vibrant, with zippy acidity and green fruit tones. The finish, however, falls a little flat."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An appealing nose of mint, herbs and citrus is followed by ripe, mouthwatering flavors of juicy fruit and lemon zest. Taut and clean, with a spicy finish. Pair with Thai food or oysters."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Partial barrel-fermentation shows in this wine's hints of vanilla and cream, which marry smoothly with grapefruit and melon fruit. The grapefruit shades toward pink, particularly on the pleasantly crisp finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tulip blossom, fresh green apple and feisty lemon acidity play on the palate of this wine that offers flavorful refreshment. The lasting length suggests hidden depths worth plumbing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fresh aromas of stony minerals, white grapefruit and passion fruit are a proper opening for a zesty, cutting palate that's loaded to the brink with citric acidity. Flavors of wet stones, lime, lemon and green apple finish long, zesty and without a stumble."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Yeasty, bland, unconvincing aromas make for an unremarkable opening. This is flabby and broken on the palate, with yeasty flavors of canned peas."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lively spice and minerals lead on the nose of this value white, with a play of fresh lemon citrus and acid offering refreshing character. The wine has body but is light. Perfect for seafood and solo sipping."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Like all wines from this producer, the fruit from this five-acre vineyard has been grown biodynamically. That explains both the clean lines of the wine and its beautiful ripe fruitiness. The yellow fruits and generous texture are deliciously full in the mouth. Drink this fine wine from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Really strong in gooseberry and feline spray aromas and flavors, with kinder notes of citrus fruits and vanilla. The wine is also slightly sweet."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A first for K Vintners, this fruit was sourced from the Sunset and Evergreen vineyards, and supervised by winemaker, Brennon Leighton. Cool climate characteristics are shown in the form of unripe berry and juicy acid flavors. There's a slight natural herbaceousness, as well."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine offers nice balance between the ripe-fruit tones of pear and green-apple and the green, stemmy herb and grass notes. There are subtle smoke and spice accents that unfold on the finish, following a plush mouthfeel that's enlivened by bright citrus tones. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A big, round and fuller-styled white wine, this comes entirely from estate-grown grapes.It offers lemongrass tartness complemented by melon and a taste of tangerine cream, a ready companion for the table or picnic basket."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Coming from a vineyard better known for its reds, this wine is a field blend of eight clones of the variety. It offers aromas of white grapefruit, oyster shells and whiffs of tropical fruit. Flavors are fleshy in feel while retaining tart, citric acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A little simple in citrus flavor, but for the price, a pretty nice wine. It's the kind of crisp, dry white I've had many times at gallery openings and such, inexpensive, but with enough panache to satisfy a picky crowd."
Sauvignon Blanc,"While this wine is crisp and clean, and the price is right, it's a little thin in flavor. Suggests peaches, pears and citrus fruits that finish with a touch of honey. It's okay for everyday food, especially Asian."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tropical fruit and hay aromas open this plump but basic SB that's low on acidity. Low-energy green-melon flavors are a bit briny, while a lack of punchy acidity leaves a short finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Saline, lime, grass, bell pepper and green bean aromas swirl around the bouquet on this fresh, coastal SB. This feels round yet crisp, with modest acidic cut and flavors or orange, passion fruit and minerals. Finishing flavors are similar, with a hint of green herb."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is an easy, simple wine that's lush and ripe with apricots, oranges and pineapples, but crisp with acidity and clean on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A blend of grapes from Washington and Oregon, this includes 25% Semillon also. As you might suspect, it's an unusual wine, opening soft and spicy, with a lightly honeyed character. Fruit flavors emphasize lemon curd and key lime, and there's a refreshing ginger ale flavor running through the fruit core."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lively aromas of grapefruit, white flowers and mineral lead into a light, fruity but rather simple palate that offers lime, green herb and stone. Overall it's straightforward and clean, but a touch dilute. In its favor, it's soft and easy to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a fresh, herbaceous wine, with green fruits, citrus and tangy, zesty acidity. A young, juicy character contrasts with a more textured aftertaste. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Winemaker: Charles Hopkins. De Grendel always produces stunning Sauvies, and Winemaker Charles Hopkins' CWG selection is another well-balanced and expressive selection. It leads with green gooseberry, orange pith and melon rind aromas, while the medium-weight palate shows a bit more concentration in banana and melon flesh flavors. Ample acidity lifts the ripe fruit tones and refreshes the finish, which lingers with faint hints of dried grass and toast. Drink now–2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Pretty scents of grapefruit, green apple and wild flowers rise up from the glass, followed by tasty citrus in the form of orange, lemon and grapefruit. Some oak adds texture and character to the mix, while chalkiness provides grip to the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine is so typical of the area. It's defined by a stony, dry nose, citrus and tropical fruit flavors, a lean, tight finish and mouth-cleaning acids. It's hardly the deepest, most complex wine you'll find, but not all good wines have to be complicated."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a delightful, fruity white, highlighted by orange blossom and jasmine on the nose and crisp waxy green apple on the palate, with a touch of dried herb and grass. Complex and medium in weight and oak, it holds up structurally, with a juicy finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This bright, citrusy Sauvignon Blanc is full of mouthwatering grapefruit and lemon flavors. It's delicately framed, yet cutting and spry with a mineral-tinged backbone that begs for pairing with oysters and other briny seafood."
Sauvignon Blanc,"More fruity than herbaceous, this is a green and citrus fruit flavored wine, crisp and bright. It has a fine, tight streak of acidity that also hints of more tropical flavors. Ready to drink. Screwcap."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This clean-tasting, nearly neutral-flavored wine is dry and medium bodied. Traces of cucumber and white pepper can be detected with effort, but it mostly offers just simple refreshment."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Quelat is Ventisquero's highest-reaching SB, but it seems narrow and ultra tight, with match stick on the nose and not a ton of fruit. As it unwinds, more aromas and flavors come out; but always is it slightly vegetal. Alongside that dominant “green” character, look for pineapple and plenty of acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a nicely made Marlborough Sauvignon at an attractive price, with herbal, grassy notes and a touch of bell pepper backed by underlying tropical fruit. It's round without being soft, retaining sufficient crispness to serve alone or with seafood."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is dry, tart in acidity and stimulating in lemongrass and pear flavors. It has a touch of New Zealand-style gooseberry, demonstrating a green-peppercorn-like grassiness. Try pairing it with a goat cheese and thyme omelet for weekend brunch."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Mineral and wet stone are a pleasant entry into this wine, which continues into flavors of pretty pear, melon and citrus. The presence of oak on both the nose and palate is not overwhelming."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Gracia de Chile is doing some good value varietals. This SB is one of them; it's peachy and citrusy on the nose, with melon and grapefruit flavors in wait. The palate has just enough weight and zest to be called balanced, and the finish lingers. Nice wine for by-the-glass."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This crisp herbal wine is light and fruity. Its acidity, grapefruit and lime flavors and the tangy texture create a wine that is clean and ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Massively ripe in pineapples, limes, green apples and lemons, this Sauvignon Blanc is clean and brisk in acidity. It's an upscale, fancy white wine that finishes just a little sweet in jam."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The inaugural vintage of this wine, named for a water goddess, this offers herb, grass, lemon and peach around a medium body influenced by some oak. As it develops in the glass, tropical fruit unfurls in a refreshing spritz before settling down to a tart finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Convincing and individual across its aromas, flavors and nuances. Casa Marin is a leader in coastal Sauvignon Blanc, and this full-bodied, racy wine grabs your attention with its crisp, pure personality. It is zesty and alive, with apple and green-fruit flavors, while the focused finish isnarrow and committed. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Integrated acidity and ripeness allow for a Good & Plenty licorice-like note, accenting the fresh apricot and white peach flavors in this lovely, easygoing sipper."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This bottling by Foxen has been consistent over the years in producing a wine of great varietal purity. The 2012 vintage is a dry, crisply mouthwatering wine with gooseberry, grapefruit and peach flavors. Goat cheese comes to mind as the ideal pairing, perhaps in a salad of bitter greens and grapefruits."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A cool, very Sauvignon wine, with strong herbaceous and citrus flavors. It's crisp, showing a bright, tight, slightly mineral texture."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A lovely Sauvignon Blanc, dry, crisply acidic and clean, with complex citrus, flower and mineral flavors. A great value for the money."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fresh, lively and brimming over with fruit flavor, from lemon to lime to peach. The appearance is light gold, the aromas are very immediate and effusive, the texture tangy and the finish light with a hint of sweetness."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisp and lively, this starts with soft scents of pink peony and thyme that add depth and interest to the citrus, pear and tropical fruit core. Medium acidity lifts the palate and carries through to the mouthwatering finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Produced from 52 acres of vines close to Cadillac, the wine is ripe, just hinting at a herbal character. Fresh lemon and apple fruit is crisp and light. It is a fruity wine that is ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This 14.5% bruiser contains 20% Viognier, which adds a tropical fruit character to the nose and palate. The mouthfeel is soft, with flavors heavy on banana and melon. Woody characteristics such as nuttiness, particularly almonds, also pop up. To its detriment, the oak and fruit seem to be fighting each other more than complementing one another."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's a lot to like in this spritely, vibrant wine, well-crafted in lemony papaya and starfruit. With a small percentage of both Sauvignon Gris and Sauvignon Musque, it's made in a fuller-bodied style, with time spent fermenting in French oak, a smattering of it new, as well as stainless steel. A squeeze of lime closes things out."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tropical fruits are cut with citrus acidity in this warm, ripe wine that has rich fruitiness as well as a crisper texture. The wine is bright while also full and rounded in the mouth. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's nice restraint on the nose of this judiciously priced bottling by the Delicato group, with lemon-lime citrus and slightly green apple flesh on the nose. The wine is strongly textural once sipped, with sour apple, lime peel and riper stone fruit in the background, finishing grippy and clean."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Hay, straw, match stick and minerally aromas outweigh this wine's fruit scents by a measurable margin. This is chunky and a bit soft in the mouth, a reflection of 2012's heat. And while it's round as a ball, it's slightly vegetal and bitter tasting on the palate, with grapefruit and bell pepper flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The wine comes from the only appellation in Burgundy to grow Sauvignon Blanc, located not far from Chablis. This is classic herbal Sauvignon that is light and fruity with tangerine and citrus flavors and a tropical fruit hint. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"On the plump but balanced side, with a perfumed nose that's almost sweet for SB. In the mouth, it's fairly lively and lifted, with nectarine and melon flavors that morph into pink grapefruit on the finish. Decent quality; will get the job done."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Simple and soft, with buttery citrus flavors. Would score higher, but the wine falls apart on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aged in stainless steel, this faint SB is herb-y and slightly grassy. Sweetness on the midpalate sticks around before the quick finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Good citrus fruit flavors, along the lines of grapefruits, limes and Meyer lemons, accompanied by zesty acidity mark this bone-dry Sauvignon Blanc. It really scours the mouth clean. Very nice with puff pastry mushroom appetizers, bruschetta with goat cheese and roasted red peppers, or crudités with a garlicky sour cream dip."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With lemon, orange, apricot and green melon flavors, this is a fruity wine, with tart notes of green gooseberries that make it savory. There's a lot of honey on the finish that makes you wonder if it's truly dry or flirting with off-dry."
Sauvignon Blanc,Citrus and salad-like aromas are more subdued and neutral than punchy. This feels melony and lower than normal on zestiness. Flavors of green fruits and mild herbs finish mellow and slightly bitter.
Sauvignon Blanc,"This pale-colored, dry and light-bodied wine combines a rather smooth texture with lively palate-cleansing acidity and light herb and citrus flavors. It doesn't go deep but does a good job of quenching the thirst quite well."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tight-wound minerality jumps from the glass in this crisp, delightful white, the grapes sourced from the famed Ritchie Vineyard. With just the right amount of richness, it remains balanced and elegant, exhibiting a complex mix of white flowers, crushed rocks and a squeeze of salty lemon."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fred Brander and winemaker Fabian Bravo study Sauvignon Blanc through several bottlings each year, but this Santa Ynez Valley appellation cuvee is an early favorite for 2013. Delicate flinty notes on the nose are bolstered with honey dew and apple. The palate leads with a lot of zing that evolves into flavors of kiwi and pear, with a slightly buttery, almost vanilla finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a spirited, funky white made from old vines, the wine aged in neutral oak. High in acidity, it has flavors of white peach and coconut."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A simple Sauvignon Blanc, this is ripe with orange and lime flavors. It finishes clean and zesty with acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This tastes bone dry, and it offers acidity that's so clean and racy, it makes your mouth feel like it's shining. The flavors of limes, lemons, hay, white pepper and vanilla are delightful."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Accessible aromas of passionfruit, apple blossoms, candied papaya and a touch of grapefruit peel show on the nose of this bottling. Anjou and Asian pear flavors appear once sipped, alongside Granny Smith apple and a peach note that grows sweeter as it sits on the palate."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Younger is better when it comes to 1865 SB. Tasted alongside the older 2007, this wine is brighter, more focused, more balanced and ultimately more fun and flavorful to drink. It is direct and clean, with passion fruit, green pepper and freshness on the nose. The palate shows green fruit,bell pepper and grapefruit, and the finish is intense."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine starts with an intriguing nose that is at once floral, fresh and spicy. On the palate, it's racy and fun but has an elegant, delicate edge. A combination of lemon and grass flavors with tropical melons and fruits are balanced and enjoyable. A good go-to white that will pair well with grilled seafood and salads."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Weak aromas of peach pit and tropical fruit are none too exciting, while the palate is dilute and carries flavors of orange and lime. Too narrow to warrant a recommendation, with barely any concentration."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Winemaker Clive Jones has been steadily improving the wines at Nautilus, and the 2010 Sauvignon Blanc may be his best yet. Leafy, capsicum notes arise on the nose and persist through the finish, backed with just enough grapefruit to see them through. Lithe and refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Full bodied and brimming in vanilla and ripe peach, this white also offers big flavors of grass and lime zest, coming down in the middle in terms of acidity. Fermented in stainless steel, it's fresh and fruity, with a creaminess to the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is on the more herbal side of the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum, showing obvious notes of tomato leaf and boxwood, but there's ample white grapefruit to back up those green elements. This medium-bodied wine finishes long and crisp."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Light and delicate on the nose with lime blossoms and damp herbs, this top-end bottling from Fred Brander shows lots of peppery energy once sipped. The tense palate is more about texture than flavors, yet wet cement, ripe lime, grass and oregano do make flashy appearances."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is one of the more New Zealand-like Sauvignon Blancs out there, and that's a compliment. The wine is thoroughly dry and very crisp in acidity, with a grassy, lemony, minerally profile that makes it savory. Approximately one-fifth was barrel fermented, adding just the right touch of cream and smoke."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a limited production wine from small parcels of limestone soil. Aged in acacia barrels, it has subtle spice and toast flavors. They wood aging has had the effect of broadening the wine and giving it extra richness. It's an impressive wine, ready to drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Hay, cabbage and pickles in the nose? That's not what most of us are seeking. The palate is overtly grassy, bordering on weedy. A slight spritz to the mouthfeel neither helps nor hinders it. Beyond that, there's not much else to say."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine has a nose of lemon peel, lemon grass, and a freshly cut lawn. It is clean in the mouth, with flavors of lemon, lime and Seckle pear that wind down to a mineral-laden finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The appellation continues to impress with this variety, well showcased by this producer. White flowers and waxy apple form its character foremost, followed by lemon peel and zest. A dry, salty finish makes for a conclusively satisfying end."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The blending of estate-grown lots given different vinification and maturation regimes has yielded uncommon elegance and complexity in a wine of this price. Stone fruit, citrus and modest herbal notes merge seamlessly on the medium-bodied palate, while the mouthfeel has a silky-creamy texture that's undeniably appealing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Briny, lightly green citrus aromas are round and pungent. A juicy, crisp mouthfeel is formed by citric acidity, while flavors of stony lime and green apple finish crisp and in fine form."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a spirited, funky white made from old vines, the wine aged in neutral oak. High in acidity, it has flavors of white peach and coconut."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This impressive and ripe wine comes from a warm vintage. It has mango as well as apricot fruits, giving a rich generous character. The acidity provides just the right tang at the end to bring out the minerality that lies at the back of this fine wine. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Light, clean and fresh on the nose, this bottling from a rather extremely sited vineyard on the western end of the appellation shows cut lawn, lemongrass, squeezed lime and wet concrete on the nose. The palate is zesty and sour at first, but a honeydew element warms it up nicely."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Showing pure tropical fruits with a squeeze of lemon, this is a ripe, tasty wine, maybe a little short on acidity, but bringing out ripe lychee and mango flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Notes of tart lemon peel appear on the nose. The lean and light body continues in that lemony vein with brisk freshness. This wine is light, with a slight texture made up of yeastiness and zesty lemon. Some notes of grass appear on the finish. Drink this light, dry wine soon."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Packaged in an unusual plastic-style recyclable bag, with a seal you have to figure out how to open, this is a fine Sauvignon Blanc. At the equivalent of 10 bucks for a regular bottle, it's dry, crisp and fruity, with lime and gooseberry flavors. Delivers lots of bang for the buck."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is on the pungent side, boasting aromas of boxwood and white grapefruit. Try it with a ceviche or herb-steamed mussels to lessen the impact, or embrace the potent, leaf-inflected flavors on their own. Either way, savor the silky texture and crisp, vibrant finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of bland citrus, oyster shell and pool water are not stout or convincing. This basic SB feels flat, while flavors of bell pepper and salted pickle finish light, bland and green."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Light and fresh, this is immediately attractive with its green fruits, spice and hints of almonds. There is also a backdrop of minerality to this still-young wine. Aromatic and crisp, it can be drunk now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine leads with vanilla over characteristic varietal notes. The palate is spritzy, while modest flavors of nectarine and citrus finish light."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With the largest production in the entire Northwest, it is important that this wine express clean, varietal flavors with characteristic brightness and focus. And it does. Lightly herbal, fresh and clean, its fruit flavors suggest lemongrass, orange and ripe apple. Excellent balance and persistence"
Sauvignon Blanc,"This combines bold fruit flavors reminiscent of peach or nectarine with leafy, herbal notes. The tomato and celery leaf tones provide a cool contrast to the ripe fruit, and a burst of crisp acids on the finish keeps the wine refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a softly gentle wine, with a drop of Sémillon contributing an oily, cashew earthiness to Sauvignon's citrus and tropical fruit flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Light and fresh, this is immediately attractive with its green fruits, spice and hints of almonds. There is also a backdrop of minerality to this still-young wine. Aromatic and crisp, it can be drunk now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Produced on clay and chalk soil, this wine is soft, with a plump texture that is ripe but has refreshing fruitiness. Very aromatic and with a rounded apple flavor, it is ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Grass, gooseberry and grapefruit wind their way around a light-bodied, crisp and ephemeral wine, aged mostly in stainless steel, with a small percentage in neutral French oak. Tiny bits of Sémillon and Sauvignon Musque make their way into the mix, for a wine that's textured and refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Hailing from Sunset Vineyard in the Ancient Lakes appellation, this wine starts out aromatically quiet, with notes of green apple, toasted Grape-Nuts and herb. The palate is sleek and lightly creamy, lingering on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Absolutely clean, fresh and vibrant, this wine smells like sliced lemons, limes and Granny Smith apples, with lively tastes to match. Full bodied, and energized with bright acidity on first sip, it rounds off on the palate and finish, turning softer and richer."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sweet and soft in vanilla, buttered toast, golden apricot and lemon honey flavors. Turns cloying after a sip or two."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Truly herbaceous and aromatic, this is a crisp, clean, easy-drinking wine, with a fresh, bright line of acidity. Ready to drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This fresh but generic Sauvignon Blanc offers white-fruit aromas and zesty passion fruit scents. The mouthfeel is juicy, while flavors of grapefruit, lime and orange finish with a touch of pithy bitterness. Along the way, riper notes of melon fade in and out."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With a handful of 24% Sémillon, this is a crisply rich Sauvignon Blanc with tempting aromas of crème brûlée and vanilla bean and a taste of tart grapefruit and lime. Easy to drink, it's complex and layered with a long finish, soft and balanced."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is intensely minerally and very tight. It has a real steely character, with its acidity packed tight into the concentrated texture, making this dense wine likely to age over three years."
Sauvignon Blanc,The wine is ripe and fruity with peach and apricot flavors and a soft generous texture. It does have a citrus touch which gives a crisp edge to this otherwise warm wine. Drink now.
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc wine. It has hints of Mediterranean tropical fruits as well as the more familiar cool climate herbal flavors. It is young, probably too young to drink now, so wait until early 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Balanced aromas of green herbs and citrus zest are fresh and vital but not aggressive. A lemony twinge of acidity lends snap to the palate, while this tastes of pithy briny tangerine and other citrus fruits. Flavors of salt, lime and grapefruit share the finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This Domaine, based in the Pouilly-Fumé region across the Loire, also has vines in Sancerre. The wine is rich, with melon and juicy apple flavors. Its acidity and steely texture form a contrast to its deliciously refreshing character. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine is initially soft and rounded. Only as it opens does the tight, crisp texture becomes apparent, bringing out crisp, green, citrus flavors as well as hinting at warmer apricots. The wine is still young; drink from late 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A beautiful wine, it shows exquisite control at balancing green, minty notes with richer flavors of apricots, Meyer lemons, vanilla and toast. The finish is dry and tart."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This vintage of Dog Point is unabashedly green without being overwhelming so. There's plenty of fig and melon fruit to provide support for the garlands of cut grass, tomato leaf and fresh herbs. The texture, as usual from this venture, is silky, while the finish is long and vibrant."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This unoaked Sauvignon Blanc is really powerful in feline characteristics. Too powerful. Unless you like that peculiar smell and taste, it will turn you off."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a lively, impressive and fresh white wine with salty, stony minerality and a well-developed texture. Fig, citrus zest and white peach flavors figure into its winning profile."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fresh like a peach on the nose, with a bit of warm radiator dust. Flavors of lemon and green apple are narrow, and the mouthfeel is limited and indicates that the lifespan of the wine may be short. Citric on the finish, and overall there's just not a lot going on here."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Some oak adds butter, vanilla and cream to the nose, and then melon, banana and citrus come on in spades on the palate. The barrel influence provides a fine mouthfeel, and the finish is properly acidic, tangy and eminently clean. Even with the oak, this is a sure thing with shellfish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Well-rounded, this offers aromas of fresh-cut grass and citrus fruit, citrusy flavors, good acidity, a smooth texture and soft finish. Very refreshing, it will be a good match with seafood, goat cheese or grilled chicken."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Flavors of peach, orange and mango fruit are prominent in this wine. Of course, there's also the complicating pleasantness of alcohol. Pair with Chinese food, a nice sandwich or pasta salad."
Sauvignon Blanc,Reserved aromas of kiwi and banana lead to dry lightly styled grapefruit flavors. The concentration doesn't seem all there.
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a ripe, oaky wine from Waipara, just north of Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island. Pineapple, mango and honey characters dominate on the nose. The palate is rich and on the flabby side, the oak overpowering much of the fruit, but those who like their powerfully oaked whites will dig this version."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Straw colored in the glass with aromas of green apple, citrus blossom and freshly cut grass, this Bulgarian Sauvignon Blanc has flavors of lemon curd, guava and pineapple. It is medium bodied in the midpalate and has a crisp, clean finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A healthy percentage of Sauvignon Musque sets the tone for this creamy and somewhat spicy white wine, a mix of vanilla and unctuous fig that finds a balance with flavors of crisp, green apple and melon. Fresh acidity keeps the fullness of the wine in check."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Rather than pungent green aromas, this bottling tends toward a sweeter aromatic profile, with limeade, mandarin orange and tangerine scents. On the palate, there is a slight creaminess and a nod toward bell pepper, but the tart, bitter and acidic elements of apple and lime pith combine memorably."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This smells taut, lean and crisp, while the mouthfeel is moderately rich, with mild flavors of pear and melon to fill it out. This wine is not a solo star but a good supporting player for lunch, wine time, or a first course at dinner, especially considering the price."
Sauvignon Blanc,"While there was some bottle variation between two samples, this elegant Sauvignon Blanc highlights the variety's more mineral, smoky expressions. Despite six years of cellar aging, there's still plenty of crisp cutting lemon and green-apple flavors augmented by spine-tingling acidity and a long chalky finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A selection of grapes from several hamlets (hameau in French), this light wine is soft and ready to drink. Lemon and green-herb flavors have a ripe, juicy character alongside flightly flat acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This bright and fruity wine is attractively ready to drink. It is fresh, crisp with apples and lightly touched with citrus."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A soft wine, holding its freshest fruit back. At this stage, it is creamy and rich, hinting at yellow fruits, but still very reticent. Some sulphur remains on the palate but should blow away in the next few months."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a tropical-fruit-flavored wine with only a hint of more herbal flavors. It is ripe and juicy with sweeping fruitiness as well as acidity. The texture, mineral in character, comes from the chalk of the vineyard—one of the top sites in Sancerre. Drink this beautiful wine from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"For an entry level wine, this is impressive, offering hints of grapefruit pith, bergamot and smoke on the nose and following those up with some meaty-mushroomy notes on the palate. It's not typical, but boasts a silky texture and a unqieu combination of citrus and umami that lingers nicely on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A good Sauvignon Blanc, clean and crisp, with slightly sweet lemon, lime and vanilla flavors, brightened by zesty acidity. Easy to drink with roast chicken."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a soft, lightly fruity wine with citrus and grapefruit flavors. It has some minerality and an attractive texture that gives shape to the wine. Drunk fresh in the summer, it will make a fine apéritif."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromatically generous, this displays notes of pineapple, pear and guava. The palate drinks off dry, with abundant tropical fruit flavors, but lacks the acidity to hold it all together."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fine and dry and crisp in mouthwatering acidity that brightens the lemongrass, gooseberry, vanilla and spice flavors. The tingly, secondary fermentation evident in June 2009 should settle out by Fall."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Matchstick aromas are joined by a fleshy tropical character that defines this wine, which is aged in stainless steel drums, neutral French oak and a touch of new Acacia. Robust and ripe, it offers a boldness of vanilla and melon."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Dominated by green-fruit aromas and also green veggies, for example bell pepper and asparagus. The body is pretty good and the acid level keeps it kicking, while the flavors run toward vegetal, just like the bouquet. Finishes with a final dose of green beans and capsicum. Seems to be fading."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sauvignon Blanc has long been the winery's calling card, but this vintage isn't quite up to past standards. Some high-toned scents add edginess to the tropical fruit, and some bitter skin flavors are borderline too much. Good, but they can do better."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc with no barrel aging, this shows apple and apricot flavors along with just a squeeze of lemon acidity. It is rich, softly textured and ready to drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine leans toward the vegetal side of Sauvignon Blanc, without ever crossing over into objectionable. In fact, it shows attractive notes of struck flint and snow pea, accompanied by hints of citrus and tomato stalk. It's fresh, clean and would be perfect with a ceviche starter."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tart, tangy lemon flavor meets green apple and quince in this lush, oaky wine. Its texture is robust."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This winery has made a nice Sauvignon Blanc as far back as I can remember. The 2016 is a linear, precise example, tightly focused and crisp on the finish. The ample pineapple and grapefruit aromas and flavors are zesty and refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"While this is certainly herbaceous, it also carries richer fruit flavors like apricots and melon to go with the grapefruit acidity. That gives it a rounded texture, full in the mouth and with a touch of minerality. Age this impressive wine another 1–2 years."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This clean and relatively crisp wine has mild fruit-salad flavors and lively acidity. It's medium-bodied, not too assertive and should please a crowd."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Solid and straightforward, this refreshing and vibrant Sauv Blanc is light and approachable, with aromas and flavors of lemon, sweet grass and pineapple core throughout. A crowd-pleasing selection for entertaining."
Sauvignon Blanc,"It's rare to get a white wine from Cabernet-centric Rutherford, but Voss does a good job with this dry, crisp, low-alcohol Sauvignon Blanc. You can taste the coolness of the vintage in the tangy acidity and the gooseberry-accented citrus, fig and white pepper flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,Herbal hints of fynbos and white-floral accents frame the bright clementine-fruit core of this wine. Subtle notes of hay and toast add depth to the otherwise brisk and lively palate. This is well-balanced and drinking beautifully now.
Sauvignon Blanc,"This medium-bodied wine features aromas of green apple and crushed stone, while the flavors turn citrusy, veering toward lime and grapefruit. It's nicely silky in texture, while a hint of snow pea marks the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Ostensibly a Central Otago producer, Rabbit Ranch sources the fruit for its Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough. The result is a lemony, grapefruity wine, with subdued herbal notes lurking in the background. It's medium in body, with a crisp, citrusy finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A rounded style of Sauvignon Blanc, but one that doesn't lose sight of its herbaceous element. So there is crispness, a vivacious acidity, but also flavors of creamy apple and ripe pear. To drink this year."
Sauvignon Blanc,Powdery bath-soap aromas are odd on the nose. The mealy palate boasts flavors of bitter melon and papaya.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tasty and well integrated, this offers fresh fruit flavors married to subtle oak nuances. It's medium bodied and balanced in acidity, which bolsters the ripe fruit flavors, vanilla and baking spice accents."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this well-made white has lively acidity and a linear approach to flavor, focusing clearly on orange, apple and melon around a full-bodied palate. Pear and lime appear on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This relatively simple but satisfying wine hits all the basic Sauvignon Blanc notes: Melon, fig, citrus and grassy herbs. It's medium-bodied and boasts a decently long finish, too. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A softly textured, fruity wine that has a feeling of richness. Apricot fruits are balanced by lime crispness. Full and ripe, it's ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"It's amazing how consistently good Lake County Sauvignon Blancs can be at such a good price, and with their '05, Wildhurst exemplifies these qualities. The wine is very ripe in citrus, fig, green melon, vanilla and peppery spice flavors, with wonderful acidity and a honeyed finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine comes from the north of the Gascony region in Southwest France. It has some herbal character as well as a delicious cool feel. Riper fruit flavors such as peach and pineapple give a warmer, soft aftertaste."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This Casablanca SB opens with crisp, dry, capped aromas of ocean foam, citrus and green herbs. It's true to form in the mouth, with nice acidity and citrusy zest. Flavors of citrus and green herbs are focused but pithy, while the finish is fresh, crisp and tastes of lime and thyme."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The warm 2015 vintage has softened and rounded this 100% Sauvignon Blanc wine. That gives the wine ripe fruits, touches of pineapple as well as white peach. With attractive acidity at the end, the wine is still crisp and young. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tight and linear on the palate, this is evolving very well for a $12 wine. Struck flint is prominent on the nose, adding a touch of Old World character, while the flavors feature cut grass and citrus. It's light bodied, but remarkably intense on the finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"As good as last year, this vintage has a subtle lemon taste that's layered with dashes of lilting lychee and fresh cantaloupe. Well integrated and pleasant, it will pair with spicy and seafood-infused foods, or go down easy on its own."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A ripe character of Anjou pear and nectarine flesh mesh with honeydew rinds and smashed cement minerality on the nose of this bottling. The palate shows a touch of smoke wrapped around green and yellow pear flesh, plus cooked apples in the midpalate."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Grapefruit rind jumps out of the glass in this vivid, balanced and refreshing white that also carries a complex mix of lime, more grapefruit and the tiniest suggestion of fresh-cut grass. A creaminess to the texture rounds things out and soothes the edges."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Very mineral and textured from the limestone soil, this is a concentrated and complex wine. It boasts considerable acidity and very crisp fruit, with grapefruit and juicy lemons coming through strongly. Age until at least 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tropical pineapple and guava flavors are restrained and balanced in this bright, soft and seductively smooth vineyard designate. Its high-toned acidity delivers stone and lemon peel characteristics, finding more citrus-tinged focus on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Pressed and fermented in stainless steel vats and partially aged in neutral oak, this wine rewards in a vibrancy of grapefruit, tangerine and peach flavors, allowing space for a plush texture through the long-lasting brightness of the fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This 100% varietal wine brings lightly styled aromas of green grass, herb, snap pea and whiffs of green pepper. The palate is full bodied and textured, bringing a sense of richness but never losing its balance. It lingers on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The nose is like citrus candy and applesauce, but it doesn't sing or pop like it could. The mouth is easygoing, with melon and grapefruit, but there's also a bit of unwelcome green bean. This wine fails to excite. —M.S. ."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Intensely aromatic, with gooseberries, cat pee and a strong dose of flint smoke all rounded out by pink grapefruit flavors that persist on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The light herbal and citrus aromas of this medium-bodied wine lead to light grassy, herbal, grapefruity flavors. A good backing of acidity keeps it lively."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The heady scent of baked apple and candied orange peel merges into a citrus-zesty, supersweet but tight palate. Sugar-crusted citrus peel—orange, mandarin and tangerine—play about the palate alongside a notion of fragrant pine resin. A rarity and source of pure joy. If you have a fruitcake laced with candied peel, don't hold back."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The hinted lushness of passion fruit plays intriguingly around the straight-laced acidity of this classy Sauvignon Blanc. The body is light but profound. Very refreshing on its own or with light, delicate foods."
Sauvignon Blanc,"We won't call this the best Terrunyo SB to date, but it is typically clean, mineral and full of lime and passion fruit. The overall balance and purity are up the ladder, while the flavors of green fruits, passion fruit, brine and lime don't hold back. Top notch SB from Chile to drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This has lively, very varietal aromas of kiwi, grass and pineapple. The palate is fleshy in feel with rich fruit flavors, tart acids and a Key lime finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This vintage marks a big step forward for this Oregon Sauvignon Blanc. As fresh and racy as a bright young Quincy from the Loire, this sappy Sauvignon has the snap of natural acidity and a tongue-tingling mix of melon, lime and grapefruit on the palate. It's drinking beautifully right now while at its most fresh."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Soft and fruity, this bright lively wine is crisply refreshing. It has juicy acidity that is flavored with apple and grapefruit flavors. Tangy at the end, it is ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"In the North Coast, Sauvignon Blanc achieves grassy, herbal, lemony flavors, is tart and a little sour, and has high acidity. So it is with this wine. The trick is to soften it. Winemaker Steve Test has given this one a little French oak but otherwise has chosen to let the vineyard, in Napa's warm northeast corner, express itself."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Still young, it's fruity but closed up. A tight, steely character gives a strong texture that is still dominating the fruit. Wait until 2015 for the citrus and white fruits to come through."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An almost neutral nose offers mild green herb and citrus aromas but little more. The palate is zesty, tangy and fresh, while a narrow set of lemon-lime, grapefruit and lime flavors ends with focused crispness. For something tight and refreshing, this is it."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A crisp wine, dry and clean, with citrus, green apple and lemongrass flavors. A small percentage of new oak adds toast, while sur lie aging brings a tart creaminess. Pretty good, but it's a little too unripe and green to earn a higher score."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This ripe, fruity wine delivers tropical fruit, apricot and white plum flavors. Its warm acidity leaves a rounded, creamy aftertaste."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Classic with grassy scents on the nose, this also shows lime peel, lemongrass, ripe honeydew and slight passionfruit aromas. Ripe Anjou pear powers the tip of the palate, with sharper grass elements and a sour citrus flavor emerging later."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tropical aromas of pineapple and melon are simple but clean, while the palate is fresh yet a little plump, with pineapple, mango, apple and banana flavors. This one will wet the whistle but it turns monotone on the finish. Drink as soon as possible for maximum vitality."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's a dash of rockiness to the nose of this wine from one of the main producers in this warmer Santa Barbara appellation, but the aromas are mostly ripe pear and red apple. There's not a ton of flair to the light and easy palate, so expect poached pears, a touch of green apple and some grassiness."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Wet cement, cut grass and fresh oregano aromas show on the nose of this affordable white. Dried herb, hay and kaffir lime flavors come through on the palate, making it an excellent choice for weekday sipping."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Beautifully ripe, almost luscious notes of yellow plum complement leafy varietal notes. The palate has that same juxtaposition of ripe generosity and focused freshness but remains toned, slender and superclean throughout. Lip smacking and very refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A block-designated wine, this shows both purpose and focus, offering a linear expression of stony minerality, crisp lemon and peach. To complement that vibrant freshness, there is a fullness of mouthfeel and a nuanced gravelly texture."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From three cool-climate sites within the appellation, this is a floral, fruity wine with a zesty underbelly of acidity. Lemongrass, lemon peel and grapefruit flavors are the main event."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Passion fruit, tangerine and fresh asparagus aromas are typical of this wine, which has been setting the pace for Chilean Sauvignon Blanc since its inception several years ago. The palate is snappy and busting loose with just-ripe banana and melon, while the finish is textured and long."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a lightly herbal wine with crisp citrus and a tight texture. The wine with its mineral edge and chewy green-fruit flavor is dry, packed with acidity and ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The Medieval Sancerre castle (Joan of Arc slept here) was built on the site of an ancient Roman fortress. Now owned by the producers of Grand Marnier liqueur, the vineyard produces an attractive, open style of wine. It has just the right tangy acidity along with delicious ripe apple and citrus fruits. The wine is ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Flavors of green hay, tart juniper berry and gooseberry surface in this Sauvignon Blanc, in addition to richer notes of Meyer lemon and vanilla. It's dry and elegantly complex, with a honeyed richness. This shows the versatility to pair across a huge range of cuisines."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A lush, creamy Sauvignon Blanc from Foothills producer C.G. di Arie, which has traveled to Lodi here for its fruit. Full and rich, the wine has a pronounced taste of lime, especially on the finish. It is dry and crisp, ready for goat cheese and seafood."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A little rough and oily on the nose, with citrus and green notes. The palate is soft and melony in feel, with banana, papaya and other tropical flavors. Sweet and melony on the finish; won't last for very long."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An herbaceous selection, this leads with aromas of just-dried grass and yellow florals that are coupled with notes of green plum, melon rind and lime pith. The medium-weight palate is lifted by ample acidity, although the finish ends ripe and fruity. Drink up."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This bottling has been pretty consisent over the years, offering plenty of ripe, spicy fruit and brisk Carneros acidity, with some complexity. It has rich flavors of lemon, lime, pineapple, exotic tropical fruit and savory spice."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This tastes a bit on the sweet side, with flavors of white sugar, orange, lemon, lime and vanilla. Fortunately, there's a cut of crisp acidity that lends balance. The grapes come mainly from Lake County and Paso Robles."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The flagship wine from Fournier is rich, showing maturing Sauvignon Blanc along with smooth, creamy plum and apricot flavors. It is full and intense—a complex wine that will repay another 2–3 years of aging."
Sauvignon Blanc,"While it does have a rounded texture, the dominant character here is a black currant and pink grapefruit herbaceousness. The wine has richness and good concentration along with tight acidity on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A classic expression of Hawke's Bay Sauvignon Blanc, this is a ripe, open-knit wine tinged with barrel influence. Vanilla and tangerine mingle with hints of smoke, lingering elegantly on the long finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A chalky, mineral aroma leads to lively green apple and dried herb flavors. This wine is light-bodied and subdued but has enjoyable, savory flavors to complement its moderate fruitiness and an easy elegance that separates it from the pack."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Full and weighty, this vineyard-designate is salty and floral, offering whiffs of orange blossom around lime zest and brine. The minerality shines through despite the size, making for a food-friendly, yet hedonistic wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is entirely neutral on the nose, then dull-edged on the palate. Flavors of papaya, green banana and bell pepper don't offer much beyond the basics, while this finishes soft and mildly bitter."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fermented in stainless steel and one neutral barrel, this aromatic and compelling wine is clean, fresh and full of delicious fruit. Meyer lemon, satsuma orange and fresh pineapple are in the mix, with supporting acidity. Tasted a full day after being opened, it remained vivid and expressive."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Bone dry and crisp, this is rich in New Zealand-like gooseberry flavor, making it mouthwateringly savory. Yet it's entirely Californian with its notes of ripe pear, peach and pineapple. An elegant wine to drink now, this would make for an elegant apéritif."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a very rich, fruity Sauvignon Blanc, offering waves of pineapple, guava, lime, green apple and honeysuckle flavors. Crisp acidity gives it a fine tartness. Nice for drinking now with spicy tapas appetizers."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine showcases the producer's historical devotion and prowess with the variety, leaving a light-bodied impression of floral honeysuckle, wet stone and succulent peach. Fleshy and creamy, it works on every level, and offers value at the same time."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The aromas of apricot, flowers and beeswax are like a welcome mat. The mouth is full and properly acidic; flavors of honey, ripe white fruits and some mustard seed make for a wine that's got a lot of power working for it. Best Buy."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Seeing just a kiss of new oak (20%), this wine offers brooding aromas of spice, white flowers, tropical fruit and citrus. The palate is full of white-grapefruit flavors backed by a zing of tart acidity, with barrel spice flavors lingering on the finish. It shows a lot of tension."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Quite light in aroma at first, this is a delicate, lithe and lovely bottling, showing lemon and yellow pear tones on the nose. That sensibility carries to the palate, where touches of yellow apple, sea salt, faint banana and a shred of bubblegum converge for a complete yet restrained white wine experience."
Sauvignon Blanc,"At the risk of overgeneralizing, Martinborough Sauvignons typically show less overt herbal characters than their Marlborough counterparts. At least, that's the case for this medium-bodied wine. White grapefruit, stone fruit and underripe melon notes finish crisp and clean."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a classic, well made Lake County Sauvignon Blanc. It's creamy with fig, vanilla, cantaloupe and pineapple flavors, but with a crisp finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Unripe and green, with acidic gooseberry, menthol and green peppercorn aromas and flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A rich wine, with tropical fruit flavors. Initially it seems soft, but then smooth acidity jumps in, giving depth of flavor, with green plums, creamy apples and intense ripeness. A real food wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tastes sweeter and fruitier than the 2009, which was dry, so if you like orange marmalade, pineapple tart and vanilla cookie sugariness in your Sauvignon Blancs, it's for you."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Light herb aromas and vivid apple flavors make this medium-bodied wine delicious, while the tangy, nervy texture keeps the mouth tingling. It has great balance, concentration and length on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Full, rich wine, with a concentrated structure to go with the pineapple and apple juice flavors. Still young, the wine should age for a year, to fill out the structure and give final richness."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's something plaguing the nose here: talcum powder? air freshener? Whatever, it seems powdery and a touch artificial. The palate features soft flavors of green bean and orange juice, and the mild vegetal character carries onto the finish. Plump, with some friendliness, but a touch green."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Youthfully exuberant in fresh-squeezed grapefruit, lemon and lime, this wine has zesty acidity and pillows of vanilla, ending clean and bright. This is the first national release of this variety for the winery."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Green bean, lime leaf and fynbos lead the bouquet of this herbaceous Sauvy B. The fruit plays second fiddle throughout, though notes of green plum and gooseberry lend support to the palate, while decent acidic lift enlivens the close. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Clove and vanilla make for a serious, if not terribly refreshing, opening. There's nice grapefruit and pomelo fruit here and a medium, lemony finish that veers towards tart. Drink up."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Very dry and tart, with pear, lemon and lime, green apple and oaky vanilla flavors that finish with crisp Russian River acidity. Has a touch of pyrazine sourness that detracts."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lively fresh-cut grass and gooseberry notes pervade on the nose and carry to the light-bodied, citrus-driven palate. A clean, flinty note offers some nuance on the brisk finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Clean and ripe, with apple, pear and zesty citrus aromas. The palate runs more round and candied than linear and sharp, with sweet, welcoming flavors of white peach and dried citrus fruits. Fuller-bodied and inviting, but still fresh. Drink immediately."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sassy passion-fruit and feline aromas set up a crisp, clean-feeling palate with tangy, green, zesty flavors of scallion, lime and sour apple. A minerally, chalky finish is zingy and clean. This is nice for value-priced Sauvignon Blanc."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Light and straightforward on the nose with squeezed lemon and sharper kumquat, this simple and easy wine shows why this grape can be a great quaffer. The palate offers minerality, touches of dill and other dried herbs, and more citrus-apple fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine has a rustic, unclean quality. At a high alcohol level it also tastes disjointed, all about heat without fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From the producer's estate vineyard on Mount Veeder, this 100% varietal vineyard designate is oaky, viscous and intensely flavored with green apple, melon and peach. Delicious honeysuckle and grapefruit peel aromas make it all the more compelling, balancing its voluptuous weight and ripeness."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This Sauvignon Blanc looks only slightly more colorful than a glass of water. On the nose, it's crisp and green, while sharp acidity matched against a light body makes for a lean palate. Crisp salty citric flavors finish tight and linear."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Too powerful in feline and gooseberry aromas and flavors, this dry, tart in-your-face Sauvignon Blanc just isn't ripe enough to recommend."
Sauvignon Blanc,Light weight and somewhat sweet with flavors of gummy peach candy and tropical fruit juice. Short and simple; drink now.
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a fairly sweet interpretation of Sauvignon Blanc, offering flavors of pineapple and pear juice, apricot jam and vanilla. With no oak, it's balanced with crisp acidity, the result of the malolactic fermentation wisely being prevented."
Sauvignon Blanc,"While this wine is herbaceous, the attractive aspect lies in its lemon and orange zest flavors that are full and bright. It's crisp while deliciously fruity, ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisp and intense, this is all about herbaceous textures and pink grapefruit flavors. It is just on the edge of tartness in its acidity, just escaping because of its great fruitiness. It needs to calm down until late 2014."
Sauvignon Blanc,"More than decent; this is good SB with no bells and whistles but lots of straight-ahead competence. The nose is dusty and plump, while the palate has roundness, weight and likable citrus, green melon and other common, fresh flavors. Sometimes the basics are more than enough; this is a casein point."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Carves a path right down the center of Marlborough's stylistic fairway, featuring hints of bell pepper, stone fruit and wet-stone minerality. It's medium in body, with flavors of nectarine, herbal flourishes and a dry, stony finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Totally grassy and herbaceous, this green, crisp wine also has a more serious, ageworthy side. There is a firm minerality here, along with a nervy, tense character that will allow it to mature. Drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,"While it's dry and acidic, it has a coarseness that's unforgiving."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Some of the grapes for this unoaked white come from old vines, as well as some from the Musque clone, making for a tart, linear taste of lemon verbena and sizzling acidity that's somewhat overshadowed by the unctuous texture and full body."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Shy initially, this wine is intensely creamy and round on the palate, nearly full bodied, dry and hard to pin down. Melon and apple come into play, as do more exotic stone-fruit flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a fresh, fruity rendering of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Ripe, peachy notes on the nose give way to hints of nectarine and citrus on the palate. It's plump and round in feel, with a moderately long finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a light-bodied, quaffable Sauvignon Blanc. Ripe aromas and flavors of peach and nectarine marry with passion fruit and some slightly discordant herbal notes, then finish quickly."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lime, mineral and grass make up the pungent, pulsating bouquet. Apricots and peaches comprise the stone-fruit-dominated palate, which is touched up by a pinch of honey. There's a nice tang and snap to the finish, which offers a little white pepper just to make things interesting."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An easy-drinking, sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc, very ripe in pineapples, oranges and kiwi fruit, but balanced with crisp acidity. A touch of new oak adds smoky creaminess. The single vineyard referenced on the label is in a warmer part of Napa Valley."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Gritty, green aromas are not really ripe or friendly. This is high in pyrazines and tastes peppery and largely fruitless. A sour finish with sweaty notes are as expected given the nose and flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There is only the faintest of aromas on this soft, lightly juicy wine. It is a warm-climate wine, rounded, soft and gentle. The freshness comes at the end, bright and with a citrus touch."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With no oak influence at all, this stainless steel-fermented and aged young wine is crisp and clean in vibrant acidity. It shows lemongrass, Lifesaver lemon and lime, and vanilla spice flavors that are just a little sweet in the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Salinic and also melony on the mostly clean and crisp nose. The palate is healthy, with round, lightly pithy flavors of green melon, peach and kiwi. Citrusy on the finish and a little green on the fade out. Good for summer quaffing. Drink this year."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Dramatically reduced production coupled with a fine vintage add up to a stellar Snoqualmie Sauvignon Blanc in 2009. Loaded with melon, citrus and apple fruit flavors, this brisk and refreshing wine is reminiscent of a racy Quincy. Perfect springtime sipper."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This explodes aromatically with honey and apricot and is balanced and silky on the palate, with 13.9% residual sugar. Somewhere midway through and on the finish, a hint of jalapeño provides a stark segue, before an appearance of pear and honey saves the day."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Clean but neutral, with decent lift, zest and body. The flavors run sweet to tropical, with pithy notes and a hint of green vegetables on the finish. Very basic and worthwhile, but regular in every sense of the word."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Light and fresh up front, with lychee, passion fruit and wet stone aromas. Feels good and balanced as if offers a nice mix of textured fruit and minerally acidity. Flavors of green melon, passion fruit, lime and green herbs come straight from central casting. Perfect for summer drinking."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Bright and tropical, with passion fruit and pink grapefruit aromas and flavors. They come together in a plump, medium-bodied wine that finishes soft and easy—a true crowd-pleaser."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This easygoing white starts with a fresh nose of grapefruit, fig and flowers and leads into zesty but complex flavors of tropical fruit and citrus. Approachable and balanced, the wine will pair well with seafood and chicken dishes."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The wine has all the warmth and ripe fruit of the vintage. Its tangy character is balanced by apple and pear fruits, along with refreshing acidity. Smoothly textured, the wine is ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tight, gritty, steely aromas of nettle and ocean mist allow for a modest amount of citrus fruit to poke through. A narrow, high-acid palate may peel back the enamel on your teeth, while flavors of sour green apple and gooseberry finish shear and tart."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Light straw in color, this wine offers aromas of pineapple, river rock and toast. Flavors of honeydew, guava, orange blossom and bitter almond are evident on the palate. The symmetry of creamy and tangy sensations continues into the smooth finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This has green aromas that lead to simple, sweet-and-sour citrus flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Here's a Sauvignon Blanc (with 15% Chardonnay) from a warm Italian climate (Cortona, Tuscany) that offers broad and thick aromas of passionfruit, peach and a touch of mango. The wine is light and streamlined in the mouth and makes a good partner to light finger foods or appetizers."
Sauvignon Blanc,This is a strange version of the Sauvignon Blanc. It is vegetal and herbal with a salty edge from the ocean breezes close by. The fruitiness of the grape is missing in this lightly toasty wine. Drink now.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Both refreshing and nicely fruity, this wine blends bright apple and lemon flavors on a tangy texture that softens a bit on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Just bottled when tasted, this is a wine that needs a few months to come together. Its ripe pear and apricot fruit and dense flavor will offer a full, rounded wine that goes more for a tropical Sauvignon Blanc character."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This seems sweet in jammy pineapple and lemon fruit. It's an easy wine, balanced by crisp acidity and a clean finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Passionfruit dominates the nose on winemaker Matt Ortman's tropically infused take on the grape, with a dash of kiwi to lighten things up. That tropicality rules the palate as well, but with a touch of flint as a grounding element."
Sauvignon Blanc,"While this wine has hints of a green herbal character, its main character conveys creamed apples and even riper fruits such as white peach. It is soft and lightly textured with just a touch of final acidity. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A little on the candied side, with pineapple and lemon-tart flavors accented with buttered toast notes from oak. The acidity is excellent."
Sauvignon Blanc,"While a bit earthy in aroma, this gains more fruit flavors on the palate and wraps them in a soft, smooth texture. Elements of apple and pear make it rich rather than bright."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With mineral and apple on the nose, this qualifies as a pure and pleasing SB for almost any occasion. The palate is elegant and lithe, while the flavors of green apple, gooseberry and grapefruit are what they should be. Pure, sound and solid wine to drink right now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Honeysuckle scents and ripe, fresh fruit flavors run from grapefruit on into tropical. This was fermented in Hungarian puncheons, picking up just a hint of toast along the way. Clean and quite delicious."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The expected aromas of cut grass and cat pee get a bit of support from peach and herb accents. On the palate are flavors of green apple, oregano, lemon, dill and bell pepper. This is light and refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"It shows the variety's dryness, acidity and light, silky texture, with lemon, lime and gooseberry flavors that finish tart and spice."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisp with a taste of New Zealand grass, this wine offers pear, lemon and a pinch of fig on the finish amid layers of acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"What a nice Sauvignon Blanc, so savory and rich in fruit. It's a little sweet, with a honeyed edge to the peach, pineapple, lemon and green grass flavors. Nice with an Asian-style chicken salad with ginger and spices. From Mason."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A little basic, but shows a nicely dry, crisp mouthfeel, with pleasant flavors of citrus fruits, green melons, figs and vanilla that have a honeyed finish. Tremendously versatile at the table."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sharp acidity doesn't get in the way of this wine's complex body and length, accenting the crisp fruitiness of lemon peel, grapefruit and white peach. Light-bodied and refreshing, it'll stand up to food as well as work as an apéritif all on its own."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Heavy hayfield aromas are oxidized, and the flavors of almond peel, citrus pith and baked banana do nothing to impress. Not a fresh or healthy wine, if it ever was. Past its prime."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The Charmat process, rather than the Champagne method, is used here. It's a clean, light, generic sparkling wine, done as a brut. Use it as an all-purpose mixer for best effect."
Sauvignon Blanc,"While there's no oak here, there's a heft and weight to the mouthfeel of this wine. The flavors veer toward orange and apricot jam."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The wine is rich, accenting tropical-fruit flavors as well as concentrated acidity. Its spice and tangy character are part of the wine's intensity. This superripe wine is still on the young side and will be better from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A clean, crisp Sauvignon Blanc with a sweet, pineapple nose and flavors of mango and melon that finishes sweet. Made from vineyards overlooking Clear Lake in the High Valley AVA, 2,200 feet up in Lake County."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Soft and gently fruity, this immediately attractive wine has plenty of acidity that points up the apple and green plum fruits and final freshness. The wine is ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Anderson Valley is better known for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, but the cool climate is also good for Sauvignon Blanc. Foursight's 2010 is a delightful wine, vibrant in citrus, tropical fruit and peach flavors, and there's no oak to interfere with its purity. With a finish that seems just a little sweet, it's a fine companion for Asian fare."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Round and grassy smelling, but turning more pungent and pointed with airing. Shows good grip and a slight spritz on the palate in front of grassy, green flavors of lime, bell pepper and tarragon. Pithy on the finish, where jalapeño and white-pepper notes rise up and take over."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A fine expression of mineral Sauvignon Blanc, very textured with green herb and fruit skins giving a tense shape to a wine that could age. It's finely balanced, the refreshing acidity cutting right through the wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a delicious and complex white wine, beginning with its aromas of matchstick, hay and hazelnuts. Zesty citrus stars on the midpalate, giving way to more generous, rounded layers of vanilla cream. Age-worthy, it peaks in bursts of orange blossom and tangerine, and would be a lovely partner for some fresh oysters on the half shell."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From a relatively cool site for the variety, this white shows an abundance of green olive and Meyer lemon. Moderate body and acidity allow for a touch of lemongrass spiciness and black licorice amid the textured mouthfeel and length."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine comes from the producer's 100% organic farm, 55 acres of its 356 planted to vines. It shows balance and grace, the grapes having enjoyed extended maceration on their skins, then let to age in mostly stainless steel, and a tiny amount of neutral oak. Light, crisp and simple, it offers a length of melon and stone fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The steep Monts Damnés Vineyard is one of the top sites in Sancerre. It has produced a wine that is both concentrated and aromatically fruity. It is stylish and full of acidity, with white fruits and tight structure. Ready for aging over several years."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tight and herbaceous, this nervy, crisp wine is full of lemon and lime juice cut with an orange zest. Floral and full of acidity, it leaves a mineral, steely aftertaste."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An extremely crisp Sauvignon Blanc with fresh lemony citrus aromas and flavors combined with subtle nuances of grass and underripe pineapple. A smooth texture and bracing acidity follow through to a slightly sour but clean, lingering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This medium-bodied wine hits all the requisite Sauvignon Blanc marks. Herbal? Check. Passion fruit? Check. Crisp, mouthwatering finish? Check. It's a reasonably good value, especially if you can find it discounted."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This crisp, fruity wine is fresh with citrus, grapefruit and an attractive zesty texture. Aromatic and bright, it is ready to drink now, clean and fragrant."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Herb aromas and veggie flavors dominate this light-bodied wine. Not much fruit flavor peeks through the herb garden, but the lean white pepper notes and crisp texture are appealing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The curve on this wine has been going up and up, and this '09 is their best yet. It's bone dry and savory in acids, with ultraclean citrus, mineral and white flower flavors. Just delicious as a cocktail sipper."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A powerful sense of green powers this wine, starting on the nose with sharp grassy tones of rosemary, chives and pine needles. The palate is also extremely grassy, though balanced by a tart pluot character."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A pretty tropical fruit nose leads on this Sauvignon Blanc from a consistently good producer. On the palate, the lush fruit falls a little flat, but the wine has a simple and dependable character that makes for good everyday sipping. Crisp and with a touch of delicate fruit, it has character and charm."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This beautifully balanced wine has a fine texture of steely acidity and ripe fruit tones. Like many Pouilly-Fumé wines, it needs time to mature further to bring out the great fruit and the fine structure that will make this an impressive wine. Drink from 2018"
Sauvignon Blanc,"Gritty, uric, green aromas come in front of a round palate with little cut. Vegetal, bitter flavors of bell pepper and grapefruit finish with another wave of bitterness."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Savory rather than simply fruity flavors are the strong point of this medium-bodied and well-balanced wine. It tastes almost like melon wrapped in prosciutto as meaty, earthy nuances blend with modest fruit accents."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The hard limestone and chalk soil has given this wine its distinctive minerality and wonderful acidity. Rich and juicy, it has intense yellow and green fruits that are laced with lime acidity. The wine has depth with concentrated fruitiness. Drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A perfect summer wine, this Sauvignon Blanc offers a combination of cheerful citrus and fruit and a flinty minerality that keep it dry and clean on the palate. Paired with seafood, it's even better."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This light-colored, almost clear, SB opens with pungent, fairly sharp aromas of sea brine and sweaty citrus fruits. In the mouth, this is tight, edgy and pointy due to blazing acidity. Citrus, bell pepper and green-herb flavors finish peppery and with scouring acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Deliciously refreshing and herbaceous, this wine is also quite fruity with flavors of apples and citrus. Lively acidity and a fine tang of lemon zest makes it crisp and ready to drink. Screwcap."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisp with apples and citrus, it's also laced with a more mineral character. It's full in the mouth, very bright with acidity and grapefruit. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This opens like an exploding hand grenade filled with pyrazines and jalapeño extract. The narrow, acidic palate is lacking in depth, but at least it's fresh. Briny, green flavors of jalapeño and bell peppers never let go, while the finish is tart and green, with a lasting note of bell pepper."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a low-production wine sourced from a single block in the winery's estate vineyard. It has a modest oak influence and brisk acidity. The wine is easy to like with tart papaya, lime, peach and vanilla flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Vanilla cookies and sulfuric match stick are about all you can draw from the bouquet. This is flat in feel, with candied, flabby flavors of green fruits. The finish is bland."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sharp-edged aromas show classic notes of grass and fresh asparagus. In the mouth, it pulls the fruit forward: there are lightly honeyed flavors of melon and peach with a slightly sugary, short finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Talk about a sharp wine; this almost socks you in the nose upon taking a whiff. It's full of citrus and jalapeño aromas, which are backed by sizzling bell pepper, serrano chili and lime flavors. Expect a raw feeling and super crisp finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Pink grapefruit is most pronounced on the otherwise soft, sweet bouquet. The mouth is tangy, with green apple and crisp pear and green melon. In the mouth, there's a welcome creaminess, then a long citrusy finish that offers plenty of sweetness closes things out."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The namesake is long gone from the company, but the wine is still a very good drop. Hints of snow pea and cut grass offset stone fruit flavors and a touch of honey. Drink this medium-bodied, mouthwatering wine up by the end of 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fresh-cut grass and gooseberry dominate on the nose of this wine, a style that's not for everyone. From there, bristling sparks of lemon and lime dominate, giving the wine a refreshing edge. Unoaked, the finish is a tad severe in its austerity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A stunning squeeze of fresh tangerine enlivens both the aroma and palate of this crisp wine that's high in acidity and dancing in refreshing tangents of lemongrass, kiwi and pineapple. Enjoy poolside or on a patio."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Incorporating 30% of the variety in Musqué clone, this wine offers fresh flavors of green apple, grass and pea shoots, as well as a distinct notion of oak. Aged in both new and neutral Acacia, as well as stainless, it has a spicy quality akin to lemongrass that lingers on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With yeasty aromas of Animal Crackers, vanilla and pear, this is more warm, soft and sweet than in the past. The year's warm characteristics are draped all over the palate, which is soft and wide. Flavors of creamy white fruits and vanilla finish with lychee and grapefruit. This lacks some spine and vivacity but will be good through the end of the year."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This terrific Sauvignon Blanc is marked by slightly pungent notes of green tomato or crushed tomato leaf, seamlessly married to smooth, ripe, tropical fruit. It's a bit creamy in texture, almost lush, with a long, mouthcoating finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,Round Pond's track record with Sauvignon Blanc is pretty consistent. The wine is rarely great—almost never bad–but frequently satisfactory. The 2012 is one of their better efforts—a little ripe in profile—but clean and savory.
Sauvignon Blanc,"This screaming vintage of Secreto is the living definition of pungency. Immediately it hits with fierce gooseberry and nettle aromas along with passion fruit and grapefruit. The palate is acidic and searing, with tangy, cool-climate flavors of lime and passion fruit. On the finish, this zinger is firm as concrete."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a very pungent Sauvignon Blanc, aggressive in those green aromas and flavors generally lumped under the descriptive term of gooseberry. It's dry and clean and acidic, with a finish like the juice of Meyer lemons."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The reserved nose offers chalk, nectarine and apple cider. It remains lean once sipped, with crushed white rock minerality and a bit of nice creaminess."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Given St. Clair's track record, this has to be viewed as a bit of a letdown. That said, it's still a well-made, light- to medium-bodied wine, offering a blend of modest tropical fruit and some grassy, tomato-leaf notes."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A handful of Sémillon adds to this wine's creaminess and texture, which is otherwise alive with citrus, stone fruit, grapefruit and ginger swirling through the glass. A lift on the finish makes the wine mouthwateringly juicy and complete."
Sauvignon Blanc,"After its rather sugary 2006 version of this wine, Maryhill has returned to a more authentic, grassy style in 2007, with the alcohol back up over 14%. It's a big improvement, showing varietal character and ripe flavors of melon and grapefruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a broadly fruity, wide open style with fresh melon, pink grapefruit and orange marmalade flavors criss-crossing the palate. It's ready to enjoy right now, low in alcohol, with a touch of marshmallow sweetness to cut the acid."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a straightforward wine showing ripe tropical fruits and a melon rind character, while mint and lemon peel ride out in the background. The fruit disappears quickly on the finish but a lovely herbaceousness takes its place."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A lightweight Sauvignon Blanc that fits the standard Marlborough profile, with slightly grassy notes layered over grapefruit and pineapple flavors. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's a pleasing snap to this wine, which sends up scents and flavors of peavine and petrol. It's pungent and penetrating, with lime and citrus fruit (from organically-grown grapes) at the core. Drink lightly chilled, now through 2021."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Herbaceous and crisp, this wine shows its steely side before it brings out the fruit. It's mineral in character along with a strongly zesty intensity and a bone-dry, very fresh aftertaste."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A considerable step up in quality from the basic Yealands Sauvignon Blanc, this offering boasts attractive aromas of white grapefruit and pea tendrils. There's a silky texture and green, grassy elements on the palate, but they never stray too far into vegetal, finishing zesty and clean."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's a nice minerality to this wine, with ripe and juicy aromas of citrus, honeydew and soft white florals. The mouth is tightly structured with flavors of sweet citrus, green berries and white strawberry hull. Balanced and clean with the medium weight mouth countered by appropriately zesty acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The Awatere is a subregion of Marlborough receiving more and more notice for its distinctive Sauvignons and Pinots. Vavasour was an early pioneer, and the 2007 is especially successful, offering up some slightly sweaty, nettle-y aromas to go along with hints of ripe melons and nectarines. It's nicely concentrated, with a slightly oily mouthfeel and good persistence."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A wine that goes straight into currants along with more exotic fruit like mango. That makes it rich in taste, as well as soft in texture. The acidity is there, but seems almost incidental, lost in the vivid fruits."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine is brightly aromatic, with notes of fresh herb, kiwi and pineapple. The palate is full flavored, showing a sense of poise along with a tart finish. The concentration doesn't seem all there."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's plenty to enjoy aromatically and texturally in this wine. It offers floral and citrus refreshment and intrigue around deeper, richer elements of melon and kiwi. Oak surrounds the big finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Vanilla wafer, slightly mealy apple and citrus aromas open this slightly unfocused wine. The palate is flat, with flavors of green fruit and citrus that finish abruptly."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This winery has made a nice Sauvignon Blanc as far back as I can remember. The 2016 is a linear, precise example, tightly focused and crisp on the finish. The ample pineapple and grapefruit aromas and flavors are zesty and refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine is soft, rounded and ripe. Good acidity is integrated into the light structure and juicy green plum and apple fruit flavors. This is fully developed and ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a fruity, pineapple and citrus-flavored wine that is tight and with a tangy texture. It is fresh, juicy and attractively crisp. It has weight and richness from the intense fruit that contrasts with the acidity. It is delicious now although it will be much better from late 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A concentrated, medium-bodied wine, this is a fine example of Marlborough and the variety. Hints of passion fruit lend regional typicity, while the core of the wine is built around white grapefruit flavors that finish long and mouthwatering."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Grassy notes with overtones of nettle and elderflower are joined by rounder, yeastier notes on the palate that also make for a softer, toned-down texture that counters the greenish flavors beautifully. The interplay between those two poles, enlivened by citrus, makes for great, appetizing drinking that finishes in lemony zing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fermented in both tank and new acacia barrels, there's definitely a depth of woodiness on the opening aromas. This is followed by a creaminess of texture on the palate, the taste leaning toward pear, vanilla and fresh melon. The finish is first creamy, then crisp, veering on spritzy."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Waipara isn't usually considered Sauvignon Blanc country, but this is a creditable effort, boasting ample melon and fig flavors and a shot of grassiness on the otherwise soft finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sadly, this is the last Patianna Sauvignon Blanc made by the late Mike Lee. It opens with great, subtle aromatics of just-ripe pear and melon and is balanced and easy to like. The finish is long and lean, with layers of acidity that would match well with scallops, shrimp or fresh oysters."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's no oak on this simple Sauvignon Blanc. It's made in a softer style, which makes the apricot, orange and lime flavors taste riper than they really are."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Pungent and green up front, with a shot of cool-coast pyrazines on the nose, this hits the palate with a lemony blast of citric acid. Flavors of orange and nettle are a touch briny, while a juicy, acidic, peppery finish is racy to the max."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With a touch of those famously green New Zealand gooseberries that give it a tart bite, this Sauvignon Blanc is relieved by California richness. There's no oak involved in the winemaking process. What you get is pure apricot, orange, lime, lemon and pineapple fruitiness, brightened with acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,Less adequate than in the past. The wine lacks aromatic zest and pungency before showing tart apple and ultimately vegetal flavors. Canned pea notes are prevalent.
Sauvignon Blanc,The crispness of this wine is balanced by the intensely ripe fruit. Together the wine has concentration as well as a bright texture that makes it refreshing. The wine is ready to drink.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Very fruity and soft, this wine blends tropical pineapple aromas with a crisper, lemon zest palate. It's a gentle wine, its acidity tamed by the ripe fruits. Screwcap,"
Sauvignon Blanc,"Clear, breezey tangerine and grapefruit aromas roll out the red carpet on this crisp, citrusy SB that pours on the green fruit and scallion flavors. The palate is both round and crisp, and the finish is long and juicy. For fresh, citrusy, varietally correct Sauvignon Blanc, it's hard to do better."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fermented and aged in both stainless steel and neutral oak, this wine opens with a heady aroma of lemon cookie covered in powdered sugar, as a spicier element of lemongrass rears its head. Bright in acidity and focused, this textured white also shows highlights of grapefruit and dried herb."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Enticing aromas of white lilies, nectarines, white peach, honey-lime water and chalky stone hit the nose on this wine from a new vineyard on Highway 154 in the likely-to-be-named Los Olivos District. The palate is creamy down the center but with tangy edges, offering flavors of lime yogurt and pink grapefruit pith."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lemon rinds, green apple skins, white flowers and a hint of pineapple guava decorate the nose of this wine from a former race car driver. It has tons of chalky mineral zing on the palate, which is crisp and light with grassy flavor and pithy grip."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From organically grown, estate vineyard grapes, this light, subtle wine has a strong acid underpinning. Citrus fruits and a suggestion of fresh pear are streaked with vanilla wafer."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Strong notes of lemongrass and pineapple jam mark this Sauvignon Blanc. It has a nice cut of acidity. While it's not particularly subtle, this is ready to drink now as a cocktail."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Very grassy and citrusy, with hints of garden-fresh vegetables and a slight floral note. It's light and almost airy on the tongue, finishing crisp and clean. A refreshing burst of anise caps things off."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Smooth and rounded, it also has a more mineral character from the gravel soil. It is tangy, full of yellow fruits, touches of citrus and lively final acidity. Give it until the end of 2014 to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a lively and fascinating Sauvignon Blanc for those who love the herbal side of the grape. Dill, basil and bell pepper aromas garnish its baseline of graphite minerality. The palate also rides the pyrazine edge, showing cut grass, lime peel, jalapeño and wet stone flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisp, green and snappy on the nose, this is however not as defined, cut or chiseled on the palate as in previous vintages. It tastes grassy, bordering on vegetal, but also a little wayward and soft."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A pleasant surprise among value-priced bottlings, this wine features a hint of gun flint that adds dimension to the fig, melon and pink grapefruit flavors. It's rather round in the mouth and perhaps a little sweet, but finishes long and savory."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Briny aromas of lime, jalapeño and minerals filter into a juicy, acidic palate with flavors that match the nose: briny citrus, lime and bell pepper. A narrow feeling finish turns pithy and bitter the longer this sits."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's quite an explosion of crisp fruit in this wine, as it shows crisp, green flavors, green apples, tense acidity and fruit tannins. Definitely cool climate, it still could age for 5 months."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is Peju's best Sauvignon Blanc in many years. It's bone dry and elegantly crisp in acidity, a clean, vibrant, food-friendly wine. With just a hint of oak, it shows rich flavors of Meyer lemons and limes, with exotic notes of papaya and white flowers. What a great comeback."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Rich glints of ripe passion fruit are burgeoning on the nose. The palate has the same richness but is kept in check by wonderfully insisting, bright lemon acidity that suggests both peel and flesh. This is not really fully sweet and thus occupies an uncertain field—one which clever and innovative cooks navigate with aplomb. This is a wine for spiced, exotic dishes that involve fruit, for soft, ripe cheeses or savory fruit combos. The wine's creamy finish pulls all the elements together."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A relatively new entrant to the American market, the 2016 from Glover Family offers subdued aromas of melon rind and fig, while the flavors most resemble white grapefruit. It's an easy-drinking wine with a crisp, tangy finish that just needs more complexity to reach the next level."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Grassy, lightly vegetal aromas of briny gooseberry and asparagus come in front of a citric palate. Flavors of citrus fruits, green bean and asparagus finish crisp but green, with scouring acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lawn cuttings and pea shoots come to mind in this lively white that's spritzy in acidity and freshness. Lemon peel and pineapple define the flavor profile, a mix of tangy and tropical."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lime, fresh-cut grass, tangerine and other clean, pure aromas are the greeting. The palate is whimsical and offers good acidic cut; flavors of lime, green apple and chili peppers are correct and turn mildly pithy on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Dry, ripe and exotic. Made from the Musqué clone, it shows melon, lime, mineral and white pepper flavors, with a touch of New Zealand-style gooseberry, brightened with crisp acidity. There are some green, feline notes that will make the wine controversial. Tasted twice."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The producer adds a small percentage of Pinot Blanc to the wine to great effect, combining seamlessly with the Sauvignon Blanc and resulting in notes of honeydew, green fig and subtle herb. The blend offers layers that are both fresh and fruity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From the ripe 2015 vintage, this is a smooth opulent wine. With its citrus and pear fruits, rich acidity and tangy aftertaste, this concentrated wine is balanced and ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Gunn Estate's 2009 is on the green side of things, offering hints of asparagus on the nose before balancing those out nicely with white grapefruit flavors. Despite the herbal overtones, it actually seems richly weighty on the palate before turning citrusy on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The Dubard family has produced a fine and ripe wine. Perfumed and with tropical fruit flavors it is a rich wine, packed with fruit and also finely textured. It has weight, yellow fruits and fine acidity. Drink from late 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The wine shows good depth along with suggestions of oak aging. It is ripe, full in the mouth and generous. Tropical fruits, orange zest and citrus combine well. The aftertaste shows a nutty bite. Drink now, or age until 2016–2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of nettle and cactus pad are briny and typical of Leyda SB. This is full in body for Sauvignon Blanc, but balanced by needle-like acidity. Flavors follow the nose, meaning nettle, briny citrus and bell pepper. A long finish is sharp but balanced."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is an easy, simple wine that's lush and ripe with apricots, oranges and pineapples, but crisp with acidity and clean on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Bright flavors like citrus and crisp apple light up this medium-bodied wine from Lake County winemaking veteran Jed Steele. It tastes dry and fresh, appetizing and just fruity enough to complete the picture."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sweeter than most classic Lake County Sauvignon Blancs, this small-production bottling is sugary in lemon, lime and pineapple flavors, but is fortunately balanced with crisp, citrusy acidity. Good with sweet and sour sauced foods, like Chinese pork and chicken dishes."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is cool-coast Chilean SB from front to back. Vegetal-leaning aromas of asparagus, cactus and lime are what the Paredones microzone has become known for. This tastes slightly pickled and intense, with coastal green-fruit notes leading the finish. High acidity ensure that this is super racy."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A sizable 70,000 cases of this bargain were imported, so it should be reasonably available. The citrus fruit does have a greenish tinge to it, boasting hints of passion fruit, snap pea and green onion, but they're within the bounds of regional typicity, and bring a crisp, tart edge to the finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Whispy and lightweight on the nose, with hints of celery, sweat and passion fruit. There's not a ton to say about this pedestrian but well-made Sauvignon. It is citrusy with a touch of bell pepper, and it finishes in a comfortable way. Classic everyday SB from Casablanca is what this tastes, smells and feels like. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Ticking all the standard Kiwi Sauvignon Blanc boxes, this wine offers straightforward feline, grapefruit, grass and green bean characters with refreshing acidity. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A new wine for this winery, this is all varietal and aged in neutral French oak. Notes of pineapple and papaya are followed by full-bodied, rounded, sweet tropical flavors that linger."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This lovely expression of the grape blends in 21% Sémillon, adding a juicy, fleshy texture that's hard to forget. With a cradling of oak, it has a rich body met and balanced by crisp acidity, amid defined flavors of apple skin, melon and pineapple."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lime and orange aromas smell more like a household cleanser than honest fruit. A chunky palate is low on acidity, while this tastes of yeast and white bread more than fruit. Bitterness on the finish transitions to yeasty as this fades."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This single-vineyard wine offers high-toned citrus, almond and vanilla bean flavors. Fresh and fruity, it's light  bodied yet doesn't skimp on flavor or texture, finishing on a tart note of lemon pith."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a real New Zealand-style Sauvignon Blanc. It's dry and tart, with rich gooseberry, lime, green apple, Asian pear, vanilla and white pepper flavors. A touch of oak brings a pleasant, buttery toastiness. The grapes come from the cool Arroyo Seco AVA and the warm San Lucas AVA, a brilliant blending decision that makes this wine especially balanced."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sharp, piercing aromas of pineapple and steel yield a bit prior to a tangy, citrusy palate. There's some chalk and slate on the finish, which adds an element of complexity. The only noticeable fault here is a candied sweetness at the tail end"
Sauvignon Blanc,"Passion fruit and citrus aromas are straightforward and a bit sharp. This feels lemony yet wan, with tangy, lean flavors of lemon-lime mixed with fresh green herbs. Notes of scallion and tarragon blend with lingering lime on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A rounded mouthfeel and plenty of fruit flavors, like apple and honeydew, make this medium-bodied wine user-friendly. The acidity is soft, and the flavors drop off quickly on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This shows the briny citrus and bell pepper aromas typical for Chilean SB. This is tangy and feels good, with snappy cactus, lime and tangerine flavors. A mild but fairly long finish is citrusy and juicy."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Barrel-fermented and blended with a splash of Sémillon, this is a creamy, rounded and concentrated white, intense in vanilla and apricot flavor."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sourced from a single vineyard on Oliver's North Bench, this was fermented and aged in one-quarter new French oak barrels. The time in oak has somewhat muted the snappy vitality of the fruit (some tasters might argue it has simply rounded it off). Grassy hints of fresh asparagus remain, and with peppery herb, juicy gooseberry and citrus peel."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Superripe orange, lime, green apple and mango flavors mark this unoaked 100% Sauvignon Blanc. The acidity is bright and clean."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This impressive bottling is brightly substantial and tensely textured, lively in acidity and yet brimming with complexity. Stony lemon and peach ride a fruitful wave of flavor and find balance between sweet ripeness and memorable crispness."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Racy and bright, with high acidity framing dry flavors of lemons, limes and grapefruits. There's a green streak of gooseberry that signals some unripeness."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Bursting with citrus and savory aromas, this wine is an extrovert that layers spicy, herbal notes on top of ripe and delicious melon and citrus flavors. It has the at-first almost pungent aroma of oak-aged Sauvignon, and slowly reveals more interesting layers of fruit and spice with each sip."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This mild Sauvignon Blanc offers simple citrus and passion fruit aromas in front of an oily-feeling, pulpy palate. Flavors of vinaigrette, cactus and grapefruit finish with mealy lemon and orange notes."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From two vineyards located in the warmer part of Santa Ynez Valley, this Sauvignon Blanc was mostly fermented in stainless steel, with a portion in neutal oak. The result is a nice, rich and creamy wine, slightly sweet in citrus, apricot and vanilla bean flavors, and balanced with crisp acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Punchy citrus aromas are prickly on the nose. This wine is quite citric in feel, with lemon extract and lime taking charge."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lots of peppery, gooseberry and citrus flavors in this dry, crisply acidic wine. It has the clean, zesty mouthfeel of almost all Edna Valley white wines, and satisfies for its depth and finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A continuing success story for the white from Château Margaux, this crisply herbaceous wine delivers impressive depths of flavor and texture. Lemon and apple dominate the fruitiness, with a touch of honey to contrast with the crisp acidity. Drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is top drawer—elegant, detailed and richly varietal. The fruit is tart and tangy but not sour or thin. Mixed green fruits, apple, citrus, and a lightly toasty nose set up a wine with impressive length. The midpalate richness includes ripe melon, butterscotch and cinnamon spice. It's all barrel-fermented in neutral oak. This is a real strength of the brand."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A touch of oak adds a sweet, smoky creaminess to this wine, but it's really dominated by Sauvignon Blanc's acidity and racy spearmint and tropical fruit. The alcohol is moderate, making it easy to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Produced at Domaine la Gemière in Sancerre, this ripe full-fruited wine is perfect to drink young. Packed with citrus fruits with a strong mineral edge, the wine is rich and floral. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There is a strong mineral element on the nose of this wine from the biodynamic-minded producer, along with lime juice, lime blossoms and a nearly spearmint herbal sense. Zesty acidity frames the palate, along with white rocks, lime and lemon juice and green pears on the finish, altogether clean and fresh."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Perfumed and lightly spicy, this is a Sauvignon Blanc that brings out the tropical fruit side of the grape. With its rich fruit and soft citrus, it is smooth and ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of spiced apples, lemon, mustard seed and mineral make for an attractive nose, but the palate is a tad tart, featuring mostly lemon, green apple and citrus rind. In general, it's light, lean and probably better as an aperitif than as an accompaniment to fine food."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a little on the watery side, with thinned-down flavors of oranges, limes, gooseberries and honey. It's also rich with honey, but there's good balancing acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Modest citrus, earth and almond notes come up from the glass, and continue in the flavors of this smooth, rounded, and straightforward wine. The balance is on the soft side, and the body is quite light."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Apricot, fig and fresh-cut grass intertwine on the nose of this pungently crisp white, lengthy in honeydew melon. Light bodied and lightly textured, it offers a burst of acidity on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is mild on the nose, with a lemon-lime aroma. The palate is soft, but it has a pulse. The wine's citrus, melon and tropical flavors finish flat. For the most part, it's clean and quaffable."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Mouthwatering acidity combines with a sweet aftertaste to give a wine that could be unbalanced but, surprisingly, has an attractive soft texture and easygoing fruitiness. Drink immediately."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The Wohlmuth family has owned this vineyard since 1803, producing wines with impressive continuity. The Sauvignon Blanc is rich, and almost tropical, but without being heavy. Apples, pears and apricots combine beautifully. It could age for a year or two, but is thoroughly drinkable now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Ripe and creamy, this has rich pear and apple fruits lightly cut by more lemon flavors. The wine is fruity, textured with minerality and still young. Drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Daryl Groom has turned out a reasonably bold, intense Sauvignon Blanc that weighs in under 13% alcohol yet manages to avoid tasting malnourished or underripe. Fig, melon and citrus aromas and flavors hit the right buttons, then finish on a lingering note. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The Awatere Valley is a cooler subsection of Marlborough, where the wines can sometimes be a bit more leafy or herbal. This wine holds true to that pattern, but balances the celery leaf and tomato stalk character with melon and fig notes. It's verging on full-bodied, even a touch oily in texture, with a long, vibrant finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Melony and green on the nose, with an asparagus note. The palate sports enough acidity to keep it afloat, but the flavors shift quickly from lime and melon to peas and asparagus."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's a slightly eccentric nose to this Moldovan SB, with its baked vanilla and floral notes, and on the palate, the wine is a bit overwrought and grapy. But despite these hiccups, the wine offers overall refreshing citrus flavors and a nice spin of spice."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine seems sweet, with apricot, orange, lemongrass and vanilla flavors. A good blast of acidity provides balance."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Punchy citrus and minerally aromas open this fresh SB. A juicy, citric palate points in the right direction, while this tastes like tangerine and orange peel mixed with lime and green herbs. A crisp, persistent finish closes it out."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a bright style of Sauvignon Blanc with pear and red-apple acidity and an attractive hint of lime juice. With a tangy aftertaste, it is light, packed with fruitiness and ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,This has grassy tones and tropical fruit flavors that'll pair with oysters and other shellfish just fine.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Just 10% of this wine was aged in new oak, with the balance aged in stainless steel. Still, that touch of oak is evident in the form of sweet vanilla and buttered toast. The fruit itself is ripe, with lusciously ripe oranges, melons, apricots and limes."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This Sauvignon Blanc smells of lemon, vanilla and pear. It's crisp and steely, with sourness on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Grassy aromas blend with notes of melon on a round, slightly flat bouquet. This is chunky in feel, with briny citrus flavors and a lively core acidity that keeps it moving along. Tangerine and bell pepper flavors on the finish are fitting."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The name, referring to the flinty soil of the vineyard, says it all. It is a mineral wine that tastes of stony soil, flint and chalk. It has a great core of hardened steel, very firm, surrounded by intense green fruits, filled with apple juice and grapefruit flavors. For aging over 2–3 years."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This bottling shows off both sides of Sauvignon Blanc—at once lush and tropical and racy and crisp. Ripe Gala apple and Bosc pear aromas meet tart orange peel and rubber on the nose. The palate is bolstered by energetic acidity, with a stony texture and flavors of sour Granny Smith apple and yellow grapefruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Toasted oak and vanilla give this wine substance and style. It's fuller bodied and robust on the palate, still young and holding on to some weight. A touch of grapefruit spruces up the proceedings, providing crispness just in time."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A nice, fruity Sauvignon Blanc, a little sweet and simple, but satisfying nonetheless for its array of ripe pineapple, citrus, lime, green apple and spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fresh and fruity, Saracina's offers tart citrus, white peach and a long-lasting, oaky backbone, with textured mouthfeel and a level of concentration that calls out for food."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Long-time Cloudy Bay winemaker Kevin Judd has been out on his own for several vintages, and this is a fine effort. The characteristic herbal, grassy elements of Marlborough are present, but toned-down, making this wine an easier fit with a variety of foodstuffs. A pleasant plumpness to the mouthfeel turns dry and chalky on the long finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Nicely ripe fruit flavors and a full rounded texture give this affordably priced wine more presence than most. The aroma is honeydew melon and the flavors are ripe apple and Anjou pear, while the acidity is on the soft side."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The squat Port-like bottle is the first indication that this is no ordinary Sauvignon Blanc. The juice was intentionally oxidized, then barrel fermented and aged on the lees. It's complex winemaking, and delivers a toasty textural wine with less snap and more softness that is usual with this grape. If you like the pricier barrel-fermented Sancerres, this is in your wheelhouse."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Matariki's 2008 is a medium-bodied, slightly grassy effort, with ripe passion fruit and nectarine flavors framed by subtle hints of smoke and herb. It's concentrated but harmonious at the same time, making it very easy to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crystal clear, loaded with enticing aromas and flavors of lemon zest, orange, tangerine and spice, this is a juicy, delicious and complete wine. Tangy and tart, it is almost impossible not to drain the glass quickly in order to refill it."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Opens in a soft, dusty, melony way, with cider-like flavors, melon and dryness as opposed to chiseled zest. Satisfying but on the bland side, with cider on the finish. Good for casual consumption but unexciting."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This tastes sweet, with a honey-infused orange flavor. There's a crisp note of acidity for balance. Overall, this is easy to drink with almost anything calling for a white wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is straightforward and easy, with sweet Meyer lemon, grass, honey and vanilla flavors. Oak-free, it tastes like it might have a little residual sugar."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Shows plenty of weight on the palate, but also an overall lack of intensity to its slightly vegetal—green pea—flavors. Still, there's enough passion fruit and grapefruit to provide a sense of balance and a crisp, clean finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Shy and neutral on the nose except for a touch of apple. The palate is hollow and citric, with racy lime flavors that end tangy. This is short on substance and offers minimal character."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An authentic Chilean Sauvignon Blanc with celery and green-bean aromas along with oceanic salty notes. Zesty on the palate and fresh, with snappy citrus and green apple flavors, and then driving on the finish due to bright acids and citric flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Soft apple notes play on the subdued palate which holds more fruit than the nose promises. The varietal notes of Sauvignon Blanc are hidden in the predominance of zesty citrus, but they are there. There is pleasing length and steadfast character on this light-bodied wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Notes of sour apple and lemon accompany this wine's dialed-high acidity. Priced to sell, it'll suffice in certain settings as an apéritif or quaffer with snacks."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Herbaceous in aroma, dry and lean on the palate, this wine offers refreshment more than flavor. Light bodied, it has a tangy texture."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Neutral on the nose except for a spot of peach and citrus. The palate is soft and chunky, with generic citrus flavors that suggest passion fruit and grapefruit. Turns a little mealy on the finish, so drink ASAP."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A little aggressive in feline spray notes, but pulls back just in time to let the gooseberry, grapefruit, lemon and lime flavors star. Crisp acidity provides fortunate balance to this sweetly fruit wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This full-bodied perfumed wine brings out ripe white and green fruits. With summer-flower aromas and plenty of acidity, it is attractive and crisply refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sweaty and pungent, loaded with overtones of crushed tomato leaf, this is an assertively herbal wine that requires careful food pairing, or a healthy preference for that style. It's not terribly weighty, but shows nice leafy complexity and a hint of curranty fruit. Try it with mussels steamed with lots of fresh herbs."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a bit herbal and sweaty, even a little boxwood-pungent. The herbal, leafy flavors are light and refreshing, vanishing too quickly on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A 100% varietal wine from the famed Ritchie Vineyard, this is a tremendous expression of elusively sublime lemon and lime, with a juiciness of grapefruit. Crisp and refreshing from start to finish, it offers complex, creamy Tahitian vanilla bean midway through, finishing with zest."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Nice and welcoming on the nose, with melon, citrus and other punchbowl aromas. The palate is graced with fine acidity, which amplifies the wine's standard green apple and lime flavors. Clean and showing no glaring issues. Textbook everyday Chilean SB; we could drink this stuff forever."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lime and mineral notes are about all that arise from the bouquet. On the palate, this is a sizzler with blazing acidity and narrow flavors of lemon and green apple. Yes, it's very fresh and cleansing; but this is also acidic and lean."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Happily the fumé has been discarded and it's simply labeled Sauvignon Blanc, as it should be. The blend includes 6% Sémillon, the wine is finished with a screw cap, and the flavors are crisp and quite refreshing. Melon, grapefruit, a little snippet of pineapple and overall a mouth-cleaning liveliness make this an excellent wine for sipping or with lighter entrées."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a light, nondescript white wine, with a trace of sweetness on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The winemaker took a Chardonnay approach, giving the wine lots of barrel fermentation and lees aging. The result is a rich, softly textured 100% Sauvignon Blanc, with lime, kiwi and vanilla flavors, wrapped into a creamy, buttery mouthfeel."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A bit strong in those infamous feline aromas and tastes, but okay in crisp, dry citrus and lemongrass flavors. Give it a good decant before serving."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Flavors of Meyer lemon, lime and grapefruit are accented with a tang of gooseberries in this wine. The finish is lively and dry, with a scour of mouthwatering acidity. Production was 2,500 cases."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A tad watery on the palate at first, this grows into cut grass, green apples, steely minerality and a touch of nectarine flesh. It's pleasant if not particularly special on the palate, with apples, pears and kiwi flesh."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A mineral-driven white, this is waxy and lemony on the palate. Light bodied, crisp and vibrant, it doesn't hold back on complexity, weaving a lengthy story of perfumed near-perfection."
Sauvignon Blanc,". Racy and strong, and comes down firmly on the grass, hay and grapefruit side, brimming with bright, tart fruit. A touch of sugar puts it just this side of sweet, with an intriguing taste of white chocolate on the finish. Gets the nod because it's so ultra-clean and zesty. —S.H."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lots going on for the price in this dry, clean Sauvignon Blanc. It has rich flavors of tart citrus fruits, minerals and white flowers. A very pleasant and versatile white wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Immediate aromas of chalk and peach waft up from the glass, followed by flavors of green lime and asparagus in the round mouth. The finish is a little heavy, but the flavors are nice and it should be a nice companion to summery soups and grilled vegetables."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Catty and grassy this is a very Sauvignon style of Sauvignon. It is tight, herbal and intense with a cool climate character that comes from the proximity of the Atlantic Ocean to the vineyards. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is clearly labeled as ""Certified Sustainable,"" although, to be fair, a lot of other New Zealand wines are also sustainably produced. Once past the labeling, 's a light- to medium-bodied wine, with slightly vegetal notes of nettles and garden peas that add nuance to refreshing citrus flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A simple Sauvignon Blanc, this is a little sweet and acidic, and the citrus flavors are unripe and green."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Muscular, mildly sweaty aromatics make this a little tough to get into, but the flavors are really elevated and complex. There's layered citrus, slate, licorice and spice all working together. The texture is nice, with spiciness coming on late. A bit of sweetness properly offsets the spicy, peppery quality to the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With fresh, grassy aromas and flavors and a subtle character on the palate, this friendly white is simple but enjoyable. Pair with grilled seafood or spicy Asian cuisine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Just the kind of Sauvignon Blanc the valley produces so well. It's flavorful in citrus fruits, peaches, golden mangoes and honey, yet balanced with racy acidity. The dry, crisp finish makes it an ideal cocktail sipper."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Dry, savory and richly steeped in oak, this SB has the markings of whole-cluster pressing and 3% Sémillon blended in, along with an inviting floral hum on the nose. The taste leans toward peach and grapefruit, zesty and alive."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From the first sniff, this crosses the line into the vegetal realm via aromas of canned green beans. A plump round palate is friendly in feel, while flavors of salted beans and canned peas finish fully green."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A light straw color, bright fruit aromas and a dot of sweetness paint the picture of an easy-drinking refresher. The bracing grapefruit and green apple aromas and flavors are attractive and pleasurable. It's medium-bodied, crisp in balance and slightly soft on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a good, every day effort, much like the baseline Ste. Michelle Sauvignon Blancs. Lightly grassy, lemony and tart, it is an all-purpose quaffer."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of fresh asparagus, grass and tropical fruit are followed by dry, light-bodied, easy-drinking fruit flavors. This wine doesn't offer a lot of complexity but still brings appeal."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's a thin line between attractive gooseberry and hay aromas, and more severe pungency. This wine is strong in the latter."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The vineyard is in the Carneros district, which makes you wonder why the winery doesn't so identify it. The wine shows brisk, mouthwatering acidity and flavors that range from ripe tropical fruits through lemons and grapefruits to tart gooseberries."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tropical and vegetal aromas turn more green as this sits. A plump, slightly tired mouthfeel indicates that this is losing steam. Vegetal, briny, pickled flavors are vacuous when it comes to fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This nose features much more nuance than a typical Sauvignon Blanc, with chalky minerality, bright stone fruit and barely ripe tropicality. It's a bit tight at first on the palate, but poached pear and papaya flavors emerge, then open to candied guava in the midpalate."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This attractive, bright white opens with aromas of orange, green apple flesh and barely-ripe white peach. The light-weight mouth offers more of the same, alongside notes of melon rind and soft brioche. A slight creaminess is countered by brisk acidity, ending clean and refreshing. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,The wine goes for the herbal side of Sauvignon Blanc with its green-fruit and gooseberry flavors. There is a grassy character that gives the wine its intensely crisp acidity. Drink this wine from 2018 so it can calm down.
Sauvignon Blanc,"One of the numerous Raimbault family winemakers, Philippe has produced a ripe and generous wine. With its tangy edge, coming from the chalk soil, it does have a textured side but that is filled out by the rich fruit with its yellow fruit flavors. The wine is ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A rather refined, restrained version of Marlborough Sauvignon, with slightly herbal overtones to the strone fruit and citrus flavors. It's round, with no rough edges, yet retains a clean, mouth-watering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sharp lime skin aromas are warmed by Gala apple and wet river stone scents on the nose of this bottling, which blends fruit from warmer eastern vineyards and cooler western ones. It's light in structure and easy to quaff, with searing acidity that carries into the finish. A stony texture frames its honeydew and grapefruit flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Inspired by Sancerre, but with grapes from other parts of the Loire, this soft, herbal and green-fruit flavored wine is refreshing and lightly textured. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Concentrated and structured, this wine needs to age. It has tight, steely acidity and a nervy, mineral texture. The apple fruits are still developing behind this intense front. It will be best from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A soft, approachable Sauvignon Blanc with aromas of yellow florals, ruby red grapefruit and yellow pepper. Riper peach flavors unfold in the mouth supported by solid acidity and a clean finish, Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a clean and bright selection, with pure notes of green melon, apple and fresh herbs. The lively palate offers lime peel and grassy tones that finish clean on the finish. It's an approachable and easy-drinking wine best enjoyed now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a nice Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now with ethnic fare, from Mexican to Vietnamese and Ethiopian. Its acidic citrus flavors will brighten and heighten richly sauced chicken dishes, ."
Sauvignon Blanc,"One of two wines reflecting different soil types, this one comes from ground with a good amount of clay as well as chalk. That produces weight, richness and an open character. Created from nearly 50-year-old vines, there is concentration here, as well as great fruitiness. The wine is still young, still bursting with crisp fruit, so wait until 2018 to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This soft, ripe wine is full of ready-to-drink fruits. Fresh apple and smooth puréed pear flavors are nicely lifted by the acidity. It's a clean, fruity wine, finishing freshly."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Best for those who like a strongly leafy side to their Sauvignons, as this wine features plenty of crushed tomato and nettle and only a modicum of tropical fruit in the background. Drink it over the next few months."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Bringing out the crispness of a Touraine Sauvignon, this wine is full of herbal flavors, crisp acidity and a soft fruity character. It is immediately attractive, simple, bright and ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of banana, mango, and pineapple open to flavors of tropical fruit salad, mango and banana and a soft finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Intense salinity and tropical fruit meld beautifully in this ripe, lusciously textured Sauvignon Blanc. Tart grapefruit and lime notes lend a zesty vitality to the midpalate. The finish lingers with chalky, salty minerality."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Grapefruit flavor is the key to this attractive, fruity wine. Crisp and lightly herbaceous, it is fresh while also having a rounder background. Drink now, but better to wait until early 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A whiff of barrel smoke flows throughout aromas of fresh cut apple, pineapple and guava on the tropical-leaning nose. The palate is is fresh and light, the steely character giving way to a blend of tropical ripeness and lean cut-grass flavors on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Not quite as distinctive as some of the other 2009 Block offerings from St. Clair, this is nonetheless a solid wine, exhibiting gently leafy nuances layered over pick grapefruit and melon flavors. It's mainstream in style, not overly heavy, with a crisp, refreshing finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is an intensely fruity wine, flavored with red currants and perfumed with a strongly herbal character. It is crisp while also ripe. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Brooding aromas of lemon curd, fresh herb and citrus lead to broad citrus and herb flavors in this wine. It lacks concentration."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Still young with delicious tangy acidity, bright fruit and intense acidity, this is a crisp wine. It has some weight and some concentration while focusing on total freshness. The zesty, mineral texture works well and will develop. Drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Passion fruit and melon vie for attention on the bouquet with grassy, vegetal, herbaceous scents. In the mouth, citrus and dry Asian pear flavors intermingle with additional grassy, asparagus tones. The acids on the back end are intense, so the tang and zip on the finish is powerful. The biggest problem here is a persistent vegetal quality that won't let up."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This fresh, young wine, showcases a palate-thrilling mix of ripe tree fruits—sappy apples, juicy citrus—and some hints of pineapple as well. The ripeness turns the lemony fruit into limoncello, and the finish is long and wonderfully refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"It's easy to see what Chef Puck is aiming for with this wine. There's a great deal of upfront citrus, tropical fruit and honey. Yet the richness fades in the finish, leading to a drier, mineral- and herb-driven balance accentuated by crisp acidity. It's food friendly, at a great price."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine includes grapes from a wide region that extends beyond Bordeaux. It's a classic, light, herbal expression of Sauvignon Blanc with citrus flavors and a tangy texture. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Bernardus has been doing a great job with this bottling, while keeping the price affordable. It's an upscale, vibrant wine of great charm and elegance. Showing keen Arroyo Seco acidity, it offers a powerhouse punch of figs, dates, pineapples, Meyer lemons, honseysuckle and peppery spice."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is an intensely herbal wine. Its high alcohol doesn't take away from its green fruit, gooseberry and cool taste. Perhaps it does increase the intensity of all these elements, producing a wine that is both rich and also taut and mineral. It does seem to need more aging, so drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Light on the nose, with a hint of apple and lime. Feels scouring, with sour-apple acidity and juicy but narrow flavors of white citrus and pineapple. Tangy but limited in flavor. Will work best as a palate-prepping or cleansing wash."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Alert but a bit yeasty on the nose, with notes of citrus, tropical fruits and green herbs filling things out, this is weighty and mature, with acidity to spare but also some creaminess to the palate. Briny, salty flavors of orange, tangerine and lime finish long and reflective of the Pacific Ocean, which isn't far from the vineyard that yielded this new-to-the-market SB."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is just the third Sauvignon Blanc from Stevens (none was made in 2008), sourced from Klipsun vineyard and stainless steel fermented. Richly textural, with a creamy minerality, this has a pleasing intensity, a sort of nervosity (as the French might put it), lined with a sweet grain character. The fruits are tart and racy, a mix of citrus rind and pulp, tangerine and pineapple, finished with natural acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A beautiful Sauvignon Blanc that shows why this warmish Santa Barbara County valley is such a natural home for the variety. With crisp acidity and a creamy texture, it's dry and minerally, with interestingly rich flavors of citrus fruits, melons and pears, and a touch of smoky oak."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a good, brisk Sauvignon Blanc whose citrus and tropical fruit, peach and vanilla flavors are delicious. Bright acidity makes it feel clean and zesty."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Not bad on the nose, where you get some tropicality, buttercup and flower blossom. But once you get onto the palate things go south. The acidity is high, creating tangy, lemony flavors, and all totaled there's not much here besides generic citrus and water."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A nice, easy-to-drink Sauvignon Blanc marked by clean, crisp acids and dryish flavors of green apples and lemongrass, with just a touch of gooseberry. Versatile with goat cheese, grilled veggies, broiled chicken or a salad of bitter greens and fresh fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fermented in a seasoned 3,000-liter oak vat, this doesn't show overt wood flavors, instead revealing hints of ramps and sweat accenting passion fruit. Medium bodied, it offers fascinating textural interplay between creaminess from lees contact and vibrant acidity. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This Sauvignon is just a little too green. The gooseberry flavors have a sharp, minty edge that detracts, and makes the wine taste medicinal."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Although the stars at Saint Clair are the Reserve and Pioneer Block wines, the regular SB bottling has maintained a high level of quality. The 2008 boasts exuberant passion fruit and grapefruit aromas and flavors, backed by fresh, grassy notes. It's medium in body, with a mouthwatering, fresh finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This crisp, focused wine may not be quite as racy as its namesake dog breed, but it is very fresh. There's a touch of green apple, but the majority of the fruit leans more toward white grapeffruit, with a long finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"You'll find plenty of tart green gooseberries in this dry Sauvignon Blanc. Yet there are also ripe grapefruit, kiwi and papaya flavors. It's a refreshingly clean wine for drinking now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A picture perfect Sauvignon Blanc. Really defines the variety in California, with rich, ripe tangerine, pear, green melon and vanilla spice flavors, brightened with brisk acidity. Shows a lot of complexity and class, and look at that price. Easy to find, with 15,000 cases produced."
Sauvignon Blanc,"In the spirit that Tejo can grow anything on its fertile soil, this wine is a rounded tropical-fruit-flavored Sauvignon Blanc. It has acidity enough as well as a warm smooth character. It is certainly ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This vineyard, just behind the Bourgeois winery, has the steepest slope in Sancerre. With a brilliant exposure to the sun it is capable of producing totally ripe rich wines. This example, packed with mango and apricot flavors, is far removed from an herbal character. Instead, it is exotic, ripe and likely to be ready to drink from 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Pale straw in color with a faint touch of green, this wine has a nose of lemon blossom and freshly cut grass. Crisp, clean flavors of apple and lemon zest wash over the tongue, culminating in a burst of fresh acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Potent vanilla announces a sizable oak presence on the entry of this wine, which follows somewhat on the palate before it weaves in a bite of preserved lemon and generous acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lemon pith and honey-vanilla provide substance to a floral, light and lingering wine also accented in melon that's food-friendly and refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Shows great acidity that really gets the tastebuds whistling, and also deep, complex varietal flavors of Meyer lemons, limes and sweet vanilla, with a green grass component in the background. Very fine and dry, an elegant, sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc of great integrity."
Sauvignon Blanc,Ripe notes of pineapple and firm guava are framed by bracing acidity that lends a slight prickle to the palate. Flavors of sweet grass and Key lime develop and carry onto the clean finish. Drink now.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Wisps of smoke and dusty mineral introduce this delicately framed Sauvignon Blanc. Tasted in late May of 2017, its still tightly wound and requires some time and aeration upon opening, but its lemony vitality is refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A white pepper aroma and full citrus and mineral flavors make this an interesting and multifaceted wine that also refreshes the taste buds. It has good, bracing acidity, medium body and subtle layering."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Slightly oily, gritty aromas display some but not a lot of citrus essence. This is a tightly wound SB with briny lime and tart kiwi flavors. A fresh snappy finish tastes of high-acid citrus fruits."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a medium-bodied, crisp and tangy wine with fresh parsley aromas and lemon and Granny Smith apple flavors. It's well balanced, restrained and will be very versatile with food."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An overtly fruity aroma and lightly sweet citrus flavors make this medium-bodied wine easy to enjoy. It tastes fresh and clean, and is rich enough to calm down spicy foods like Thai or Mexican."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This confusing SB is bold in color, with aromas of petrol and apple juice. Dry, bitter melon, papaya and white pepper flavors control a dull finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Orange and lime aromas control the nose on this spritzy, tangy wine that literally shows bubbles in the glass. The flavors are lemony and sharp, with a grassy accent. Tasted twice."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Prickly and varietally correct on the nose, this opens with grassy aromas and a pop of citrus. A standard mouthfeel with adequate acidity projects salty citrus and green flavors, while grapefruit pith and lime notes work the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a slightly spicy wine that's rounded and quite rich in style. It leans towards a tropical character although textured and still quite youthful. Give this attractive, ripe wine another six months or so to develop. Screwcap."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This golden dessert Sauvignon Blanc smells mature, with honeyed apricot and botrytis aromas. The palate is alert, bright and just sticky and honeyed enough, with apricot, quince and honey flavors. Juicy acidity on the finish keeps this from turning cloying."
Sauvignon Blanc,"We haven't seen anything labeled Trio for years, but the return of this Concha y Toro brand seems solid. Aromas of orange blossom, lime and other green fruits are good, while flavors of citrus, grapefruit and cucumber are fresh and appealing. A good but standard wine that is lifted by a touch of green herb and brine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's a touch of honeyed sweetness to this wine that gives it a softly appealing taste. The orange, apricot, tropical fruit and vanilla flavors are absolutely delicious, while there's just enough acidity to lift and balance the richness."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Rich and layered, this wine expresses the essence of its vineyard's fruit. Smacks of tangy citrus, lime blossom, lemon curd, peach and yellow apricot flavors that flood the palate and finish long and spicy. It's a very big wine, but balanced and elegant."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of peach and lemon peel prime the palate for flavors of peach, apricot, and lemon curd. It's well balanced, with flavors of ripe stone fruit and citrus that wash across the palate and leave a creamy texture in their wake."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is the top cuvée produced from the Fournier's Pouilly-Fumé vines. It is rich while crisp, showing fine acidity and a mineral texture. The green fruits cut through the zesty texture of the wine giving concentration and depth of flavor. Drink this serious wine now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a thin, water wine with delicate grapefruit flavor. The finish is brightened by a burst of citrusy acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The expected cut-grass greenness shows on the nose of this wine, but so do plenty of white flowers, nectarine, golden apples and chalk. The palate is rather rich in style for this grape, perhaps explained by its slight aging, but well done with ripe apple flesh and more cut-grass flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine impresses in its mix of stone fruit, melon and tangy passionfruit, its texture soft and velvety, marked by moderate acidity. It's a complex, lengthy white that's easy to get lost in, with or without food."
Sauvignon Blanc,A curiously earthy wine with ripe fruits but also a sense of bitterness. Notes of gooseberries and undergrowth finish with an off-dry character at the end. Screwcap.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisp, citrusy and slightly herbal, this is a well made, mainstream Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc at a terrific price."
Sauvignon Blanc,Aromatic hints of tomato leaf and pea shoots make for a highly appetizing nose. The concentrated body adds lovely notions of ripe mirabelle plums and combines fulsome fruit with ample zest. The midpalate maximizes these flavors and leaves you with a very refreshing finish.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisp lemon, green apple and riper stone-fruit aromas are hidden behind a slightly reductive and rubbery touch on the nose of this new brand from the Coquelicot team. Grassy flavors show on the sip alongside Anjou pear."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Mildly snappy nettle, passion fruit and tangerine aromas are a nice entry to this spunky but basic SB. Lime and tarragon flavors quickly fall off on a light finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is another intensely crafted Sauvignon Blanc from Casey Flat. This wine opens with muted aromatics of orange rind and melon, a swirl of sweet jasmine too. It has a rich, creamy palate that captures the warm climate of the vintage and its provenance."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An intense, herbaceous wine that also manages to be light. Acidity and green fruits keep the poise and the freshness, while the flavors of green plums and gooseberries are balanced with some structure."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of yeast, talcum powder and grass set up a palate of pithy citrus and pyranzinic flavors that are green and grassy. The finish on this Sauvignon Blanc, a grape you don't see too often in hot Jumilla, is green-flavored and snappy."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fresh, minerally lime aromas set up a zesty palate with lemon-lime, pineapple and apple flavors. There's nothing complicated about this snappy white, which finishes with some bitterness and lasting acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Subtlety on the nose hides the hazelnutty softness of this pliable, pleasing and gentle wine that has a balm-like structure which almost comes across as soothing. With echoing nuttiness and an apricot core, this does not fit any particular mold, but is intriguing, authentic and totally convincing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"One of the more pungent and herbaceous examples of its type, this dry wine smells like green onions and chives and tastes like lemon and lemongrass. It's best for adventurous drinkers."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fresh but not overly racy, with apple and pear aromas. There's ample snap and pop to the palate, but not a whole lot of body or specificity of flavors. That said, the tastes of lemon and green apple are clean albeit shallow, and the finish is more of the same. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Underripe, slightly green orange peels mix with honeydew, grass and lime on this straightforward selection. The palate shows a touch of peach on the first part of the sip before delving into pungent grassiness that continues through the finish, all complemented by a wet stone frame."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is winemaker Simon Waghorn's entry-level wine under his own label, designed to give a taste of the “province” of Marlborough. So it's a medium-weight, multiregional blend featuring plenty of passion fruit and lime aromas and flavors, plus a fine line of acidity and a long finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An intense wine, this is all crisp green herbs and tight citrus flavors. With acidity and minerality, it is a complex wine from vineyards in Bué. It could age for another few months and will be better from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a bit austere and linear, but the tradeoff is that it's refreshingly brisk and long on the finish. Tart citrus—think grapefruit—forms the core of the wine, garnished by hints of struck flint."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a limited production wine from small parcels of limestone soil. Aged in acacia barrels, it has subtle spice and toast flavors. They wood aging has had the effect of broadening the wine and giving it extra richness. It's an impressive wine, ready to drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fruit salad aromas, simple apple and pear flavors and a soft texture add up to a pleasant wine. Light bodied, and balanced away from crispness, it is still enjoyable and refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"In line with this winery's penchant for oak, this fast-aging wine is buttery and heavily toasted. As a result, snappy apple or citrus fruit is harder to find than many might want it to be. Nevertheless, there's some bold lemon and creamy vanilla on the thick, mouthfilling palate. And for that, it earns points."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lightly herbaceous, this is a ripe, lively wine. Grapefruit and lemon zest flavors are complemented by fuller apple and quince flavors. A tight minerality in the background will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Luxurious on the nose and palate, this has loads of sweet, juicy peach, melon and white blossom. Dry in style, with notes of waxy lemon peel and a brisk oyster-shell minerality, this builds in elegance and complexity on the palate. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Intense, concentrated wine with herbaceous flavors allied to gooseberry, pink grapefruit and a steely edge of acidity. With its powerful fruits, it is worth aging for a few months."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From a fourth-generation farming family, this wine is sourced from the Niebaum-Tonella and Morisoli-Borges vineyards along the Rutherford Bench. It opens with a bouquet of sweetly ripened mango, peach and pear, which continue on the palate. Fierce acidity and a drop of anise form the backdrop of the wine, which finishes somewhat tropical."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Bright, fruity Sauvignon Blanc that has a touch of tropical fruits as well as more citrus and grassy characters. Klassik is the most open, attractive, ready-to-drink style from Styria. Screwcap."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With light herbal and earthy aromas, and crisp citrus flavors, this is a mouth-cleansing, appetizing and refreshing drink. Tangy grapefruit, lemon and tart apple notes make it vivid and the ample acidity carries everything through to a lingering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Good varietal flavors of citrus fruits, wildflowers, gooseberries and vanilla in this wine, along with crisp acidity. On the downside is too much sugary sweetness, which makes it cloying."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From the Awatere subsection of Marlborough, this wine is all about balance and tang. The nose offers cantaloupe, white peach and a welcome hint of green pepper. Tangerine and melon fruit mix on the palate, which is defined by its stony feel. The finish is ample and quite citrusy, and overall this wine features a bright, likable disposition."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Coming from flint soil, this is a structured, mineral wine. Tight texture, tangy acidity and an almost chewy character show that this young wine is still developing. It will reveal citrus and apple flavors in a year, so drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Very rich style of wine from 50-year-old vines. It is smooth, opulent almost, packed with pure pink grapefruit along with an herbal, grassy character. Concentration is the hallmark of this fine wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Green and focused on the nose, with a hint of fresh bell pepper. The palate is light and chiseled, with crisp flavors of white grapefruit, lime and passion fruit. Finishes elegant and fresh. An ideal quaffer to go with salads and shellfish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fermented entirely in stainless steel, this is a floral and fruity wine from a great Carneros vineyard. Offering sharp acidity and rounded flavors of honey and apple, it begs to be enjoyed with food along the lines of foie gras and fresh oysters."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The first Feral made by new winemaker, Peter Devison, continues a tradition of excellence. Natural yeasts and fermentation in neutral oak, combined with a superb vintage and world class vineyard, equal a gorgeous bottle of wine. Creamy, leesy, textural and deeply imbued with mineral-soaked citrus fruit, flesh and rind, this ultrarefreshing wine is a joy. Notes of cucumber and melon contribute further complexity through the long finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Redde's top wine, named after the winery, is rounded, rich and full in the mouth. Flavors of toast and ripe pear combine with tangy acidity, producing a complex, intensely fruity wine that should age for two years."
Sauvignon Blanc,"One of the top wines from Henri Bourgeois, this is rich and ageworthy. Its green and white fruits push through a concentrated structure to give a dense wine with ripeness and great elegance."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This herbaceous wine has aromas like snap peas and flavors like fruit cocktail, white pepper and celery. Light to medium in body, it offers good acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Opening with a bouquet of dried apricot and almond paste, this is a full style of Sauvignon Blanc, with tons of lemon on the finish. Pair this with seafood."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The aromas in this wine are light, with notes of herb, citrus and orange peel. The palate is dry and broad, with tart citrus flavors. Although appealing, it seems a bit generic."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Made without oak fermentation or barrel aging, this wine is the essence of Santa Ynez fruit. It's savory and rich with lemons, limes, kiwis and oranges, as well as a touch of tart gooseberry."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc is very easy to drink, if slightly lacking distinctiveness. Melon and fig flavors finish on a slightly grassy note, while the texture is plump and soft."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Having spent time in both oak and stainless steel, this wine offers intense golden toast flavor and focused acidity, the fruit recalling grapefruit pith and melon."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Given time to settle in both used French oak and stainless steel, this is a nice effort from a well-respected vineyard that's big and juicy in grapefruit and melon. Made in a lighter style, it offers a bite of oak on the finish, leaving a substantial impression."
Sauvignon Blanc,Struck flint and tomato stalk on the nose lead into a medium-bodied wine with strong citrus overtones. White grapefruit and green leafy notes linger on the dry finish.
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a crowd-pleaser made in larger quantities that succeeds in its herbal lemongrass and suggestion of fresh-cut grass, which lovers of that style will find appealing. The finish is reminiscent of lemon curd and tastes ripe."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A note of grass blends with tropical aromas centered on passion fruit. Tangy, tight and citric, this offers flavors of green apple, tangerine, lemon and passion fruit. A light streak of green works its way onto the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The wine is young, which explains the intense acidity and flavors of currants as well as citrus. It is right up front with its fruitiness. Bright acidity shines through and gives the wine delicious, ready-to-drink character."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A steely mouthfeel and tight lemon and herb flavors make this full-bodied wine refreshing, dry and reserved. It will make a good accompaniment to shellfish or pasta."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Just a whiff of citrus shows on the restrained nose. The palate is very crisp, even lean, disclosing slight spritz. Some riper fruit waits at the core but you have to savor the midpalate to find it. The wine is light and very refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Veramonte's first high-end Ritual Sauvignon is a big success. The nose is mellow, refined and minerally as opposed to pungent and feline. The feel is fresh, clean as a razor, and easygoing, with lime, nectarine and passion fruit flavors. Long and lightly green on the classy finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"High in acidity and upfront in pineapple, lemon, lime, green mint tea, vanilla and white pepper flavors, this Sauvignon Blanc has a sweet-and-sour taste. Made without oak, it's brilliantly clean and savory, but just a little too sweet."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Green gooseberry, underripe mango and pineapple core notes abound on the nose and continue on into the palate of this easy-drinking white. The mouth is a bit rounder than expected, but brilliant acidity keeps things balanced and lifts the close. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,This overtly ripe white shows a generosity of guava and mango flavor—a tropical outpouring of perceptible sweetness that's wrapped in a boldness of body and vanilla oak.
Sauvignon Blanc,"This big-bodied wine is full of smoke, toast and custard in the nose, sure signs of barrel fermentation or aging. The mouth is packed with thick, custardy citrus fruit, which renders it a bit like orange-tinged flan. Fortunately, it retains its acids, which keeps it well balanced despite the heavy oaking it went through."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is very much in the house style of this producer in this vintage. It is a ripe wine, orientated towards yellow fruits with a hint of mango. The acidity is there to balance what is a rich wine, keeping the structure and shape. Drink this wine from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fresh pear and jasmine rise on the nose of this wine, a fulsome, full-bodied version of the variety that's creamy in vanilla and caramel undertones. Rewarding with food, it finishes fresh and fruity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A live-wire wine with baby powder, tropical fruit, citrus and green melon on the nose. Made in the forward, fruit-first style; it radiates with natural acidity such to the point that it's borderline aggressive. But with such power you also get strong green apple and grapefruit flavors. Edgy and citric overall, but at the same time you won't get shorted."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With feline aromas of juniper bush, grass and sweaty citrus, this is true Sauvignon Blanc. Oak aging has lent an easiness to the mouthfeel, which shows good acidity. Flavors of green fruits, melon and pithy bitterness end in chalky clarity. This is one of Argentina's best Sauvignon Blancs."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A vibrant nose of grapefruit and flowers leads on this complex but lively Sauvignon from lauded winemaker Gottfried Mocke. On the palate, the oak-aged wine offers crispness and more tropical fruit and citrus, with a touch of minerality and spice on the finish. An excellent, elegant wine that can handle both typical SB dishes (seafood, salads) as well as heartier fare."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The appellation continues to impress with this variety, well showcased by this producer. White flowers and waxy apple form its character foremost, followed by lemon peel and zest. A dry, salty finish makes for a conclusively satisfying end."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From the intensely steep Monts Damnés vineyard, this wine is rich and full of ripe tropical and citrus fruits, with a tight line in steely minerality. It's still too structured and firm, so drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The grapes are from one of the warmer parts of the valley, and the wine is sweet and ripe in tangerine, apricot and vanilla flavors. Crisp acidity provides fortunate balance to this likeable young wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Mild lemon and apple aromas are compromised by a harsh, stalky element. The mouthfeel is basic and spritzy, while generic apple and green melon flavors end in tropical sweetness."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Made in a New Zealand style, which is very dry, crisp in acidity, minerally and rich in citrus flavors, with a sour, green note of gooseberry. A brisk Sauvignon Blanc that will love goat cheese."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Rich and creamy, with opulent pineapple and peppery spice flavors finished with a savory edge of lemongrass. High acidity works in the wine's favor, making it mouthwatering."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Grassy with green leaf and fresh-cut herb notes, this dry, easy-drinking wine boasts lively lime-juice acidity and pleasant apple flavor. Slightly dusty notes of dried herb and reed distract on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Made in the slightly sweet, crisp popular style, this Sauvignon Blanc offers easy flavors of pineapple, pear and apple juice, with the sweet vanilla of oak."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Okay for everyday drinking, with crisp acidity and a clean, steely minerality undergirding the lime flavors. The drawback is a strong feline smell and taste that some will find offensive."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With acrid matchstick aromas and little else, this wine gets off to a rough start and never finds solid footing. The palate is chunky and grabby, while the flavors are burnt and stalky, with bitterness to the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Grove Mill's 2009 Sauvignon Blanc strikes a pleasant balance between zesty citrus and ripe stone fruit. It's medium-bodied and plump in the mouth, with a crisp, clean finish that invites another sip."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Pungent and smoky, filled with minerals and grapefruit, this is top-flight Sauvignon Blanc. The mouthfeel is smooth, silky and slightly creamy; the finish, long and delicate."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Why, at the northern limits of Burgundy, there should be a small village producing Sauvignon Blanc is a curiosity, as the name of the wine suggests. This ripe, tropical fruit and crisp green plum-flavored wine is tightly textured and ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The Dillons Point subregion of Marlborough often produces particularly pungent examples of Sauvignon Blanc, but this wine doesn't quite hew to that mold. The herbal notes are prominent but well mannered, backed by plenty of mild citrus—think white grapefruit—and melon. Ample weight, a silky texture and a lengthy finish complete the package."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Ostentatiously ripe, this full-bodied wine hardly hides its richness. It's generous and packed with fruitiness. The acidity and the tighter texture are backdrops to this great burst of fruit. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a wonderful wine that's dryish and vital in acidity, with savory Meyer lemon, grapefruit, lemongrass, apricot and vanilla flavors. A touch of oak brings a buttered toast richness. Only 260 cases were produced."
Sauvignon Blanc,"What a great wine this is. It combines Chardonnay's rich, creamy texture with Sauvignon Blanc's dry, tart, lemony flavors to yield a complex wine that's a joy to drink. The acidic, peppery finish begs for food to accompany it. A very great value."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With its soft bouquet and friendly but easygoing melon and apple flavors, this ranks as a good but chunky SB with maturity and moderate oxidation already showing. It's good, tasty and easygoing, but it lacks the sizzle and snap Chilean SB is known for. Drink immediately."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This fumé starts with aromas of peach, vanilla and spice, followed by an elegant balance of citrus fruit, toasted vanilla and lemon zest. Fresh but with added body, this SB will pair well with oilier, bolder flavored fish, cheese, cream dishes."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Stony perfume welcomes one into this full, fleshy white adorned with peach and green apple fruit. Succulent on the midpalate, it delivers flavor and body with balance, finishing on a tart, lingering spark of key lime."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fermented in stainless steel, then aged in a mix of neutral oak and stainless steel barrels, this single-vineyard, 100% varietal Sauvignon Blanc is racy and bone dry, a true Loire Valley style. Classic varietal flavors of gooseberry, lemon/lime and slate, with a bit of spritz to liven it up."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Dusty stone-fruit and white-flower aromas are mature, while the palate is linear and citric. Dry salty flavors of pineapple and tangerine finish with notes of mustard, lemon and brine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Starting to show its age with a pale golden hue, this fumé is classy and restrained. Aromas of waxy lemon, pineapple and green bean mingle with base notes of butterscotch and smoke from the oak. The palate offers less excitement with the fruit disappearing some and searing acidity taking over. Nevertheless, this wine would be a versatile pairing for a variety of dishes."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An odd wine, as sweet as pear and peach fruit juice, yet with a strong dose of acidic, green gooseberry. The right salty-sweet foods will balance it."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Stainless-steel fermented, this white is grassy and pea-like. A simple thickness on the palate is offset somewhat by a tang of grapefruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From vines on the north bank of the Loire, this wine is in a soft gentle style. With attractive fruit, it is light in texture with an attractive spring in its step. Ready to drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The extreme side of the grape variety comes out in this boisterous wine that smells like lemon and garlic, tastes like gooseberries and grapefruit, and has that vibrant, crisp texture that goes great with seafood."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From a tiny patch in the tiny Guenoc Valley, where the Langtry winery lies, this Sauvignon Blanc is partially barrel fermented, and it shows in the texture. In taste, expect Mandarin orange and melon, along with acidity that's high and mighty."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Few wineries in Central Otago devote much time or energy to Sauvignon Blanc, so it's nice to try one on occasion. This is pungent and boxwood-like on the nose, but the flavors are less aggressive, more white grapefruit and celery stalk. There's ample weight and a crisp, refreshing finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There is a very accessible aromatic entry to this bottling. An almost-sweet touch of crystallized honey and beeswax is cut by green plum, wet stone and chopped lemongrass. The sip delivers rounded and pleasant flavors of nectarine, red apple and chamomile."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An intoxicating whiff of musky floral perfume persists throughout this bright, full-bodied Sauvignon Blanc. Gooseberry and white grapefruit flavors are tart and crisp, gaining plushness through the addition of Chardonnay in the blend. Elegant and substantial in mouth feel, it finishes long."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of fresh-cut grass, citrus peel and yeasty dust are typical of the Casablanca region. A round mouthfeel offers proper acidic cut, while flavors of grapefruit, lime and bell pepper finish green but fresh."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's a layer of sweetness to this viscous wine, which exudes aromas of graham cracker and pear, finishing in a light coating of lemon."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Here's a nice Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now. It shows how well this variety grows in the warmer parts of the county, with citrus, apricot, peach and spice flavors. Crisp acidity provides zesty balance to this deliciously drinkable young wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A full, fruity wine, it is ripe and finely textured. It also has a good chalky, mineral character, rich apple and grapefruit flavors and tight, dense acidity. It should be aged until 2015."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Inspired by the Loire Valley, where the “rocks decide” (as this bottling's name suggests), this wine is very light and almost cloudy in color, and shows tons of chalk, wet wool, lime peel and seashore on the nose. The texture is immensely intriguing, presenting flavors of just-ripe Anjou pear, cut grass, and iodine-like kelp tones, with a flash of petrol on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tart and fresh, with lovely aromas of grass, green plum and asparagus. Glimmers of stony minerality flash on the palate, with lime pith and plum skin flavors driving through to the mouthwatering finish. Brisk and slightly pricky texture."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sprightly and delicious, with grapefruit, fig, Meyer lemon and apricot flavors made even brighter by vibrant acidity. This elegant SB will be delicious with a salad of bitter greens, figs, chèvre and grilled shrimp."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisply herbal in nature, this is a citrus fruit flavored wine. It's full of refreshing acidity, giving it a lively, bright character and an aftertaste that reinforces that laser focus."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An attractive nose of gooseberry and grapefruit is followed by bright, fresh flavors of lemon, tropical fruit and minerals in this affordable SB. Slightly lean but still elegant, the wine has a refreshing citric finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This unoaked wine is tart and simple, with sweet and sour flavors of oranges and pineapples, like fruit juice with alcohol."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Matthew Loso makes excellent Sauvignon Blanc, and this is no exception. Smooth, lush and creamy, it's bursting with concentrated fruit flavors of apple, peach and papaya—definitely not a grassy style by any measure. Everything points to barrel fermentation, including the lick of fresh cream in the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Powdery on the nose, with aromas of sweet pear and lime. The palate is round and melony, indicating a warmer origin. Tastes a lot like basic Pinot Grigio; peach and green melon are the lead flavors. Finishes solid but soft, with lasting sweetness."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A fine example of Styria's signature wine style, this Sauvignon Blanc has enticing herbaceous aromas followed by rich, full green plums, white currants and a layer of sweet, full acidity. Glass stopper."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Light aromas suggest butterscotch and baked apple, and indeed this is a soft SB with creamy, plump flavors of peach, melon and sugar. Sweet on the finish, and then it falls off the cliff before winding up a little mealy and bitter."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromatically generous, this displays notes of pineapple, pear and guava. The palate drinks off dry, with abundant tropical fruit flavors, but lacks the acidity to hold it all together."
Sauvignon Blanc,"On the nose, this everyday SB delivers pungency and citrusy green-fruit scents. The mouthfeel is racy, while flavors of lime, passion fruit and grapefruit finish zesty and with green, herbal notes of thyme and oregano."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Dusty, yeasty citrus aromas show some grit and harshness. The palate is chiseled and acidic, with tart flavors of orange, lime and green herbs. Fresh and highly quaffable, this is the kind of wine to drink with shrimp salad or raw oysters."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Eradus continues a successful run with this year's Sauvignon Blanc. As usual, it's fairly pungent and herbal upfront, but then delivers waves of passion fruit. It's concentrated and fairly full-bodied for a Sauvignon, with a lingering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine comes from Woodinville Wine Cellars. It displays aromas of lemongrass, custard and tropical fruit. The flavors are ripe and full bodied, lingering on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A bouquet of white peach, honeysuckle and rose petal with a whiff of freshly mowed grass yields to flavors of cantaloupe, Turkish delight and nutmeg joined by a touch of salinity. Soft mouthfeel and well-integrated flavors make way for a bright floral splash on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a Sauvignon Blanc with more meat and punch than the average white. The nose, crisp, clean and fresh but rounded, leads into a balanced, substantial wine with good acidity and an assertive mouthfeel. Elegant but has character. Could pair with richer dishes."
Sauvignon Blanc,"One of Chile's go-to producers of Sauvignon Blanc has bottled a winner. This deals classic aromas of citrus, nettle and sea brine. The palate is slightly oily and creamy, but lively with acidity. Flavors of persimmon, melon and ocean brine finish slightly salty, with a fresh-meets-oily feel."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An intensely herbal and ageworthy wine, this has tight acidity and a very fresh gooseberry character. With its intensity of flavor, it has something in common with New World Sauvignon Blanc—except this has terroir-driven minerality on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Ripe aromas of passionfruit, ruby red grapefruit and a juicy grass element show on the nose of this wine by Andres Ibarra and Caren Rideau. That ripeness tightens on the palate, with Granny Smith apple skins, yellow grapefruit juice and pressed green apples."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Here is a steely, bright Sauvignon Blanc that's rounded in citrus, melon and herbal flavors, finishing clean and with ample acidic lift."
Sauvignon Blanc,"For a spring or summer sipper, this fits the bill. The nose is neutral except for light apple, pear and lime aromas. In the mouth, it's zesty and linear, with acidic cut. Flavors of white pepper powder, fresh yellow pepper and citrus lead to a crisp, clean finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Starts out smelling sulfury, and slow to burn off. Then turns jammy sweet in the mouth, with sugary flavors of pineapples, green apples, honeysuckle and vanilla."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Snappy aromas of citrus and lime come with minerality on a bouquet that's pungent but doesn't punch. This feels clean, friendly and well built; flavors of lime, tangerine and mango finish persistent, with no breakdowns. This is what top Chilean SB is all about."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With no oak influence, this Sauvignon Blanc was cool-fermented, preserving fresh fruit, and it did not undergo malolactic fermentation, so that the acidity is brisk. It was aged on the lees. That is a great formula for keeping prices low while crafting a wine of creamy interest. With citrus, lemongrass, melon, fig and vanilla flavors, it's a stunning buy for this price."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From two vineyards located in the warmer part of Santa Ynez Valley, this Sauvignon Blanc was mostly fermented in stainless steel, with a portion in neutal oak. The result is a nice, rich and creamy wine, slightly sweet in citrus, apricot and vanilla bean flavors, and balanced with crisp acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Zingy is a great word for this dry, crisp Sauvignon Blanc. The lemon, lime, grapefruit and spice flavors cleanse the palate. Nice with shellfish, goat cheese, grilled veggies."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Matchstick and flint arise out of the bottle before blowing off to show off a mix of herb and jalapeño around a well-oaked, robust white wine. The stronger, more savory characteristics evolve pleasantly into a fresher, rounder taste of tangerine that provides a freshness to the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisp and fresh, this is a soft style of Sauvignon Blanc that brings out pineapple and apricot flavors as much as herbaceousness. A streak of lemon and pink grapefruit acidity is well integrated into the riper fruits. The aftertaste adds bright acidity to the mix."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Citrus and tropical fruit aromas are basic and the slightest bit stalky smelling. Spritzy lift gives the body some kick, while zesty flavors of sport pepper, jalapeño and citrus culminate in a juicy finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This Sauvignon Blanc is neutral on the nose except for a smack of lime. Mild on the palate, this tastes of briny, salty citrus fruits and peels. A fresh finish confirms that this is straightforward but enjoyable."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An unusually bright-gold color and aromas like vanilla and nutmeg signal a complex style for this unusually textured and nicely viscous wine that is technically light bodied in terms of alcohol. Balanced out by good acidity, it is not overtly fruity but goes for complexity and spiciness that linger on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Welcoming bubblegum, key lime, grass and cement aromas check many Sauvignon Blanc boxes in this widely available and reliable bottling. The palate leads with decent structure, but then ripeness prevails, with peach and more bubblegum notes."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A concentrated, medium-bodied wine, this is a fine example of Marlborough and the variety. Hints of passion fruit lend regional typicity, while the core of the wine is built around white grapefruit flavors that finish long and mouthwatering."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A waft of Nilla Wafer opens the bouquet of this light, well-composed wine, followed by fruity notes of lemon and orange, a floral component at its core. Zingy, it remains balanced in the glass, lightweight with plenty of fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Done in a bracing, sappy style, this is a concentrated wine with lush flavors of lemon drop, orange candy and Key lime. It's ripe and juicy, with a suggestion of beeswax in the mouth."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Varietally and regionally correct, with green, grassy, punchy aromas of citrus, white pepper and jalapeño. This is prickly in the mouth, with lively acidity and flavors of lime, scallion, green apple and bell pepper. It finishes with cut and juicy acids."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Stainless-steel fermented and aged, it's lightly aromatic with notes of herbs and kiwi. The palate is medium-bodied with sweet tropical fruit flavors but the concentration doesn't seem there."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is favorably marked by hints of stuck flint and bold, herbal flourishes on the nose, then settles down to deliver stone fruit and citrus on the palate. For the price, it's surprisingly long on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tangy and intensely vibrant in citrus, this site-specific white sings in grapefruit pith and zest, layering those flavors atop spicy ginger and herb. It finishes bright and fresh on the palate, eager for food."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Thoroughly delicious. This captures a distinctive side of the grape that blends a sweet grassy herbaceousness with a lively mix of apple, lemongrass, citrus and orange peel, finished with the slightest suggestion of honey."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a tight, crisp rendering of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Struck flint aromas add nuance, while the bright lemon-lime flavors whirl together into a citrus sorbet of refreshment."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The ripe and fruity style typical of Vacheron wines is evident here. Citrus flavors are given a rich fillip by yellow fruits and a rounded, full texture. Touches of minerality and youthful acidity are already well integrated into the body of the wine. Drink in 2015."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A delightful bottle of Sauvignon Blanc with notes of pink grapefruit, lime zest, and medley of fresh herbs. What the palate lacks in terms of fruit concentration it makes up for with a fine zip of acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This tight and steely wine is fresh with crisp fruits and a strongly herbaceous character. It offers gooseberry, grapefruit and intense, youthful acidity that needs to calm down. Give this very young wine until the end of 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Pungent, zesty and quite varietal in its expression. The nose is racy and intense, with nettle, sweat and passion fruit aromas. Expect a wet, almost spritzy palate with green-edged fruit flavors and light herbaceousness. There's bite and sass to this one, and the finish is quite long."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Winemaker Mike Lee continues to prove his prowess with Sauvignon Blanc in this latest vintage of Patianna, Patti Fetzer's line of organically farmed wines from outside of Hopland in Mendocino County. Fermented entirely in stainless steel without undergoing ML or barrel aging, it delivers everything you love about the variety, inviting one in with melon and minerality, then following through with a surprising creaminess and almost decadent, mousse-like finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Citrusy in style, with aromas of orange, passion fruit and grapefruit. Feels flush and full-bodied, with basic tangerine and navel orange flavors. Fresh on the finish but hollow in terms of depth, with a light fade."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Mildly grassy in the nose, with accents of fig, melon and citrus rind. It's got some hay and funky earthiness to the otherwise tangy, citrus-driven palate. The acidity isn't overpowering, so the mouthfeel is a bit creamy. Overall it's a good mainstream wine unlikely to offend anyone."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of field greens and wax bean are restrained on the nose. This has a round palate with citric acidity. Flavors of briny green fruits finish slightly closed and bitter. This wine reflects the 2016 vintage which was a cloudy, wet one in Casablanca."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Named after a pioneer of wood-aged Sauvignon Blanc, this wine has toast as well as rounded fruit. The subtle wood focuses on enriching the fruit and bringing out its steel and citrus character. The wine can certainly age, drink until 2020."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This ripe tropical-fruit style of Sauvignon Blanc is delicious. Its crisp side with some citrus is balanced by the apricot and ripe mango flavors that give the wine richness and fine perfumes. This is a food style of wine, ready to drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Aromas of fresh herbs, kiwi and pineapple are followed by off-dry tropical-fruit flavors that trail toward the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Everything you'd ever want in a Sauvignon Blanc is here—and then some. Grassy, herbal, citrusy aromas set the pace, joined by some slightly feral, wooly pungency that adds even greater complexity. On the palate, it's plump and mouthwatering without being excessively tart, and lingers gloriously on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This brilliant Sauvignon Blanc should be scooped up by sommeliers. It's exceptionally dry and tart in citrusy acids, with a mineral scour that's perfect for shellfish or savory appetizers. The flavors are of lemons, limes, gooseberries and white pepper. Beautiful and compelling."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Quite light aromas of talc, lemon zest and mineral along with whiffs of tropical fruit lead to sleek, bright, focused and lemony flavors backed by zippy acidity. It should shine paired with ceviche or oysters."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is appropriately intensely aromatic and flavorful, but the aromas and flavors come across as a bit simple and unnuanced. Modest grassy hints settle easily over white grapefruit flavors, which finish on a slightly chalky note."
Sauvignon Blanc,"For such a large-production wine, this is admirably complex, featuring delicate herbal shadings accenting hints of nectarine and citrus. The texture is a bit oily, but that's balanced by a long, mouthwatering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Better than most Argentinean Sauvignon Blancs, and made in a fuller-bodied style. The nose has weight and wax aromas, as well as melon, and the palate features ripe, almost pithy citrus. Dried apricot and a nick of passion fruit work the finish. Drink immediately."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The wine is soft with a lightly toasty character to go alongside the bright acidity. Its grapefruit and gooseberry flavors are right up front, giving a fruity aspect to the steely texture. Drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Nicely dry and tart in acidity, this pretty wine is fine to drink now. Flavors recall citrus fruits with richer notes of papayas, along with gooseberries and green mint from cool-climate grapes. Made without the malolactic fermentation, the wine was coopered in 55% French oak."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Crisp acidity brightens this wine's seemingly sweet lemongrass, tropical fruit and vanilla flavors. Try pairing this with Chinese food or ham."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This sharp, spicy, herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc showcases the flavors of the Columbia Gorge AVA. It's a pungent wine, with sweet grassy flavors and a hint of toast, despite fermentation in stainless steel. Unusual but interesting."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a round, ripe and deliciously smooth wine. With a warm, vanilla character as well as full and rich fruit, it is generous and ready to drink. The acidity at the end leaves a refreshing aftertaste."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This lively, fruity wine is simple in character but full of grapefruit and lemon crispness. It is softly textured, but has a final bite of lemon zest and tight acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Dry and layered in crisp melon, lime and lemon zest, this aromatic SB is complex and kissed by honeysuckle. It's a natural go-to for shellfish, especially Hog Island oysters from the coast near Point Reyes. A warm goat cheese salad would also do nicely."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This Elqui SB smells about as neutral as you'll come across, with a hint of burnt grass to the nose. Oily and dense in feel, this tastes of salt and bitter dried melon."
Sauvignon Blanc,"One of the range of single variety sparkling wines from Steininger, this Sauvignon Blanc shows all the herbaceous character of the grape. It is tangy with a strong zestiness, gooseberry fruit and a tight lemon aftertaste."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Opens with honey, orange and a bit of harsh matchstick. The palate is sticky and comes up just short of cloying, with candied melon, citrus and mango flavors. Finishes sweet and sugary, with caramel and toffee notes. Tasty but unctuous."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sweet and simple, this features fruit-juice-like flavors of orange, pineapple and apricot. A great big burst of lemony acidity saves it."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a complex young wine, made in the white Bordeaux style. It has been barrel fermented and aged on the lees. Marked by crisp, mouthwatering acidity, it shows a grassy, hay quality that dries out the citrus fruit and apple fruit, giving the wine a bone-dry feel. Very fine and near the top of Napa Valley Sauvignon Blancs."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This medium-weight wine starts off with wonderfully pure, expressive aromas of ripe passion fruit. On the palate, it's a bit prickly and leafy at first, like tomato stalks or nettle leaves. It then settles back down into tropical fruit on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,Muscat gummy and herb aromas are followed by dry tropical fruit and ale flavors that are lightly styled. Drink now.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Waxy, slightly mealy white-fruit aromas set up a pulpy citrusy palate. This offers salty orange and yeasty flavors in front of a finish that's struggling to stay fresh. Drink immediately."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Partially barrel-fermented, partly stainless steel, this is a fresh, crisp and easy white. With ripe citrus, fig, spear-mint, honey and spice flavors, it's nice as an apèritif, but will stand up to Thai or Vietnamese fare."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Grass and gooseberry are prominent on the nose and palate in this crisp SB, bright in dialed-high acidity. That sense of vibrant freshness mellows somewhat midway through the wine, allowing it to finish with a lushness on the tongue."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fills an important niche in California whites, a bone-dry, tartly crisp, minerally wine that gets the mouth watering. With pleasant citrus, floral and peppery spice flavors, it's perfect as a cocktail sipper with appetizers, like puff pastries, grilled veggies, toast rounds with goat cheese."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Muted at first, this wine slowly opens, revealing a suggestion of oak, generous tropical fruit and honeydew melon. Medium to fuller-bodied in style, it holds back before going over the edge, maintaining a nice structure through the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A fine bottle at a great price, this fresh and clean-tasting Sauvignon Blanc offers a bracing mix of tree fruit, with just a touch of sweet herb. It's clearly varietal: no frills, just straightforward and very nicely made."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a lush and likable white, a touch sweet in perception, with fully voluptuous body and texture. Peach and Good & Plenty black licorice play off the palate as a gravelly wet-stone note teases in the background."
Sauvignon Blanc,Spicy and fresh aromas lead this elegant but accessible white from Florina. Tropical fruit flavors are round and layered but the wine has a good spice and mineral mix. A great wine for the table?lots of food-pairing options here.
Sauvignon Blanc,"From vines grown on flint soil, this is a perfumed, crisp wine, hinting at almonds and spice. The background is a reminder of the soil, very mineral and severe. The wine is ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Phelps is, of course, a red wine house, but they do a credible job with Sauvignon Blanc. The ‘06 is stylish and balanced, and while it's not especially complex, it offers up a crisp mouthful of citrus, fig, melon, spice and oak flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A slightly pungent sweatiness is an appealing facet of this wine, helping to accentuate its vibrant tropical flavors of passion fruit and pineapple. It's round in the mouth, then draws to a crisp, refreshing conclusion. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A woody, toasted note speaks to well-integrated yet present oak in this white that maintains medium-bodied texture on the palate. Bright, lemony acidity complements the creaminess, dashing in wet stone and undeniable floral notes of apple and orange blossom."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This displays a particularly rich style of Sancerre, full bodied and opulent. It has the purest white and citrus fruits, with plenty of crisp acidity. But it is the intensity of the wine and its generosity that marks it. The wine is young and could age—although why wait when it is so good now?"
Sauvignon Blanc,A mix of oak and hazelnut savoriness contrasts against piquantly tart Meyer lemon and grapefruit. Everything is structured around a medium body and abbreviated finish.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Cut grass and grapefruit rind aromas are followed by simple, crisp, citrusy flavors. It's medium in body, with a slightly chalky feel and a clean, refreshing finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is yet another plump, sweaty smelling Sauvignon Blanc from this producer. This vintage is fat in the mouth but kept alive by adequate young acidity. Salty, briny flavors of citrus, particularly grapefruit, end in similar briny fashion."
Sauvignon Blanc,"One of the first wines to be released from the 2011 vintage, this Sauvignon Blanc shows how chilly the year was. It's barely ripe, showing dry, acidic citrus and mineral flavors, with a green, minty edge."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Soft hints of peach, verbena and peony grace the delicate nose of this lightweight white. Touches of green banana and pear flesh out the palate, while ample acidity keeps the mouthfeel fresh through the finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A simple Sauvignon Blanc, this is dry and mouthwateringly tart. The lemon and lime flavors have a green edge of gooseberry."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is an approachable, lightweight Sauvignon Blanc with upfront tropical fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is clean and mild, while flavors of white grapefruit and lime finish sweet and easy, alongside notes of dried pineapple and mango."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc aspires to the New Zealand style of crispness and dryness. It succeeds on both levels, with fruity, oaky flavors of lemons, limes and honeydew melons. There's a strong note of gooseberries that make the wine tread a careful balance between ripeness and greenness. It's ripe, but just barely."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This medium-bodied wine comes across as a bit plump in the mouth, delivering plenty of pineapple, white grapefruit and nectarine flavors that firm up nicely on the dry, lingering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"There's a hint of smoke that adds a dark edge to the pretty white floral notes of this easy drinking, elegantly balanced Sauvignon Blanc. It's dry and refreshing on the palate, while hints of waxy minerality and bitter lime pith lend complexity to the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a good, brisk Sauvignon Blanc whose citrus and tropical fruit, peach and vanilla flavors are delicious. Bright acidity makes it feel clean and zesty."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A relative bargain in the scheme of barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc, Kevin Judd's version boasts toasty, nutty notes upfront, followed by creamy citrus and stone-fruit aromas and flavors. It's a top example of the richness and potential age-worthiness that oak can bring to carefully selected lots of Sauvignon Blanc."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A zesty and somewhat prickly Sauvignon Blanc, this starts off with scents of white melon rind, tart gooseberry, green pepper and sweet grass. The palate offers a more assertive citrusy flavor alongside hints of green fig and zesty spice. The close is juicy and refreshing. Enjoy now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"True bargains are hard to come by, so drop your guard for this $8 SB and you may wind up happy. Xplorador from Concha Y Toro is peachy and simple, with light grassiness and green notes. But it does have a plump, neutral palate and likable pineapple and apple flavors. Inoffensive and not flashy, but good for the money."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Vanilla cream and a stony minerality form around a bitterness of preserved lemon and a touch of heat, that takes on an abundance of intensity on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tight, crisp and with herbal as well as citrus flavors, this wine comes from flinty soil. That creates all the intensity, the tautness, the mineral texture and the ability for the wine to age. True to style, this wine will need to be kept, so don't drink before 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,"What a delicious Sauvignon Blanc, and look at that everyday price. It's so easy to like the creamy, yet tart flavors of peaches, with a slight touch of sour lees for complexity. From Mason Cellars, with a case production of 48,000."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Named for the proprietor's daughter, Taylor's is stainless-steel fermented and meant to exude juicy waves of pear, apple and lemon, a fully immersive expression of fruit and minerality. Well balanced, it shows a tease of peach fuzz and the crispness of never having met a swath of oak."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a perfumed crisp wine, attractively fruity and with delicious acidity. Its fruit is effusive and needs to calm down and fill out, so just wait until 2018 for it richness to be fully apparent."
Sauvignon Blanc,"An unusual blend of flavors fills this full-bodied wine. It has fruit cocktail aromas and obvious butter and butterscotch flavors as if it's trying to be a Chardonnay. The texture is rich and soft, and the butter keeps flowing on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Archetypal Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, featuring pungent, herbal aromas to go alongside bold passion fruit notes. It shows ample weight in the mouth, even a slightly oily texture and pronounced green flavors that persist a good long time. Probably best with fresh tomato or strongly herbal dishes."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Pinot Noir specialist Bryan Babcock explores this aromatic white grape, delivering a lush and creamy expression. Poached pear and orange blossom notes combine with a nutty quality on the nose, while the wine's creamy consistency meets buoyant acidity on the palate. Lush apple, pear and cashews flavors complete the picture."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Part of this wine was barrel fermented, which gives it a creamy, spicy richness. The rest was raised in stainless steel, preserving vital fruitiness and acidity. The result is a richly powerful, interesting wine, vibrant in citrus, fig, melon and spice flavors, that finishes thoroughly dry. Sommeliers should note this wine, not only for its inexpensive price but for its versatility and sophistication."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A foursquare wine, all angles and edges, that still needs time to soften and open. It is going to be rich and delicious, hinting at white currants, pears and green plum skins. The minerality and vegetal edge is there as well. An impressive wine from this ancient property."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The wine comes from silex soil around the small village of Saint-Andelain. Crisply textured, it has vanilla and spice flavors to fill out the intense acidity. The aftertaste, still young, brings in a steely tight texture. Drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A good value selection, with green notes of bell pepper, asparagus and lime on the nose and in the mouth. Lightweight, with good lift and a herbal character that lingers on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Saint Clair produces some 86,000 cases of this solid Sauvignon Blanc. If it's not quite as rich, concentrated or flamboyant as its Pioneer Block bottlings, it still delivers authentic Marlborough Sauvignon character. Pineapple and tomato leaf notes are well balanced, while the wine is medium bodied and slightly creamy in the mouth."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is the winery's stainless-steel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc. Dry and racy in acidity, it shows lemon and lime flavors, with a rich hint of tart kiwi."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This 40-acre estate in Pessac-Léognan has produced a spicy, wood-aged wine from 100% Sauvignon Blanc. The wine has a tang while also having concentration, a touch of toast and a floral aftertaste. It will age for a few years, and be ready from 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Ripe and creamy wine, with some herbaceousness and yellow fruits. Layering citrus and a tangy texture, it's fruity, full of lively acidity and ready to drink this year. Screwcap."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a clean, basic wine with white-fruit aromas of peach and apple. The palate is well balanced, and there's a good level of citrus flavor along with green herb accents. On the finish, it's more tropical, with a hint of banana."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The cold vintage compromised this wine, giving it high acidity and unripe flavors of green peppercorns, citrus fruits, dried hay and ammonia."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Airfield's owners have been grape growers for almost 40 years—a remarkable track record in Washington state. These vines date back to the late 1970s. Crisp and light with the alcohol just over 12%, it's the sort of low-impact white wine that we rarely see made in the U.S. A perfect little café wine, that should be drunk chilled, from tumblers."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This standout wine has enticing herb and mineral aromas, plus rich, unorthodox flavors that resemble fresh fennel bulb and crisp white peach along with racy acidity and a good, substantial mouthfeel. It tastes concentrated, though not overly full bodied, but most of all it has a memorable personality."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A solid blast of tropical and green fruits rises from the glass. The palate is sharp and citric at first, and then it opens and evolves to show grapefruit, lemon and tangerine flavors. If you like a crisp, steely style of Sauvignon, then give this refreshing wine a shot."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Vegetal notes of asparagus mingle with accents of chalk and sweet grass on the nose, while ruby grapefruit and underripe mango flavors burst in the mouth. Vibrant and clean; drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a medium-bodied, slightly plump Sauvignon Blanc that hits the right herbal notes of snow pea and tomato leaf, then blends those with grapefruit and hints of stone fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This aromatic herbal Sauvignon is crisp while also showing the ripe fruit of the vintage. It is full of citrus and melon fruits, tangy acidity and a bright, fruity aftertaste. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Good structure on this 100% Sauvignon Blanc, with crisp acidity and even some nice, dusty tannins. But the pineapple, Meyer lemon and lime flavors are too sugary sweet for a dry table wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,Nectarine and melon aromas are ripe and round on the nose. The palate feels big but properly balanced with acidity. Flavors of grapefruit and bell pepper are prominent over the pyrazine-heavy finish.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Clean and fresh, and also varietally correct as it unloads full but accurate aromas of cucumber, passion fruit and lime. Casas del Bosque does very well with Sauvignon Blanc. This wine has all the citrus, tang and style you could ask for, but it shows good depth and complexity as well, which is what pushes it up to the next level. For $14, this wine delivers plenty."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Hailing from coastal Leyda, this wine has a bouquet that comes with an oceanic edge, plus grass and green fruit aromas. The palate is crisp and lively, with good acidity bolstering citrus, lychee, melon and grass flavors. The finish is cleansing."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The bright young thing in the Tracy range, this is an intensely herbal wine, its acidity fully integrated into a rich texture. It's packed with lemon, green plum and pink grapefruit flavors. Give it six months."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fresh and vibrantly floral on the nose and palate, this lovely white from the musqué clone imparts full-bodied, voluptuous layers of pineapple and grapefruit rind, lingering long on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Leafy and herbal, with green tomato and pineapple flavors that mesh surprisingly well. It's medium-bodied, with a slight tang on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"From one of the cooler climate vineyards for Sauvignon Blanc on the Central Coast comes this intriguing wine. Aromas of petrol, tar and crushed sea shells are set alongside a background of green apple and pear. There is nice zing on the palate, with the petrol elements continuing with roasted bell pepper and crisp apple."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Super-fruity, a real orchard, with pineapples, apples, Meyer lemons and even something tropical, like mango. In fact, a little too sweet, almost cloying on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The relatively cool Adelaide Hills are making a name for their Sauvignon Blanc, and this example shows a restrained, grassy bouquet and flavors of grapefruit and tangerine. It's plump on the midpalate, then almost razor-sharp on the finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Mossy freshness and fragrance appear on the shy subdued nose. The wonderfully slender and sprightly palate is fresh and delicate. There is something subtle and lithe about this, which is very uplifting. The finish is refreshing and clean."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Very much on the ripe, tropical side of Sauvignon Blanc, this is rich and concentrated. There are citrus and toast along with the spice and pineapple. Textured, it is still young and will age."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Sauvignon Gris and Sauvignon Musqué, this wine delights for its supple apricot and nectarine flavors. It's floral on the nose, with grapefruit and fennel scents, unfolding slowly to reveal a rich texture and fresh acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Acidity marks this mouth watering wine. It's crisp and tart, providing balance to the slightly sweet flavors of pineapple and apricot jam. Good price for a Sauvignon Blanc of this popular style."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a lively tangy wine that is made to drink young. With its crisp texture, hint of minerality and lively acidity, it is a refreshing wine that could serve both as an apéritif and as an accompaniment to seafood."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Over the past few years, San Pedro has consistently put out excellent SBs under its 1865 label. This sings of coastal Chilean Sauvignon via mineral, passion fruit and grapefruit aromas. In the mouth, it's chiseled like a statue, with a mix of citrus and green flavors. Expect a cutting, crisp, zesty finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The allure of ripe but zingy passion fruit proves almost irresistible. Juicy and plump, the palate is saved by citrus freshness. Tropical fruit rules and makes for immense, easy pleasure."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a ripe while intensely herbaceous wine. It's steely and crisp, but spoiled by the intrusion of sulfur that hasn't gone away. If the sulfur blows off, this is a potentially attractive and fruity wine finished off with lemon zest."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Attractive and very much in the vein of what is really good Chilean Sauvignon Blanc. The bouquet is all about green herbs, cactus pad, passion fruit and citrus. The palate transitions from lemon-lime to tropical pineapple and passion fruit, while the finish is breezy and zesty. It is a lean, 100% Casablanca style of SB, and while it's a step down from the great 2007, the drop is not a big one."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With no oak influence, this Sauvignon Blanc was cool-fermented, preserving fresh fruit, and it did not undergo malolactic fermentation, so that the acidity is brisk. It was aged on the lees. That is a great formula for keeping prices low while crafting a wine of creamy interest. With citrus, lemongrass, melon, fig and vanilla flavors, it's a stunning buy for this price."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tangy green-apple aromas and flavors make this medium-bodied wine refreshing, crisp and palate-cleansing. The texture is vibrant and the finish lively."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Dusty white-fruit and citrus aromas are more than adequate but nonspecific. This feels round, with salty citrus flavors. A modest finish is doing its best to stay fresh and vital."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Slight in aroma at first, this wine slowly reveals a waft of lemon. It's light in flavor, and it delivers crispness, with a hint of oak on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Casas del Bosque makes some of the most pungent, expressive Sauvignon Blancs in Chile. This vintage fits the blueprint; it's forward, punchy and full of passion fruit, white grapefruit and tarragon on both the bouquet and palate. Shows mineral components, saline and scallion on the finish. A high-quality wine with a commensurate price tag."
Sauvignon Blanc,"You get what you pay for in this crisp, savory Sauvignon Blanc. It's tart and clean, with fruity flavors of pineapple, lemon and lime juices that finish a little sweet."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fermentation was done in a mix of stainless steel and French oak, yielding a soft, accessible, lightly spiced wine. Flavors mix notes of fresh cut grass and celery with melony fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Sweet-leaning aromas of apple, nectarine and mandarin orange are cut by a wet-cement aroma on the nose of this bottling. It's light and easy in style on the palate, with lime rind and chalk flavors. It's altogether quite mellow but very refreshing and quaffable."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With organically grown grapes from both Lake County (58%) and Mendocino (42%), this showcases the best of both regions. It has a great mix of lemon, grapefruit, honeydew and kiwi freshness that remains balanced on the finish. It's a quaffable summer wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,Potent herb aromas and flavors mark this medium-bodied wine. It will need something assertive like pesto pasta to make a good match.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Enormously ripe, with pineapple, lime, tangerine and green apple flavors that show the dry heat of this eastern part of the Santa Ynez Valley. The acidity tastes added on, but welcome, providing savory relief to the richness."
Sauvignon Blanc,This lightly aromatic wine offers notes of herbs and kiwi. The flavors and acid seem dilute.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Rounded, rich and tropical notions of mango and passion fruit dominate the nose. The palate is more restrained and focuses on zesty, citrusy freshness. A total winner where refreshment is concerned: easy, fresh and zippy."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With only 56 cases imported, this may be one of the hardest Saint Clair wines to find, but it offers a refreshingly austere alternative to some of the winery's other bottlings. It's only medium bodied, with delicate, leafy aromas and pristine white-grapefruit flavors. Convincingly dry and bracing on the finish, it would make a brisk counterpoint to rich fish dishes."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Hard-driving aromas of nettle, jalapeño, sea brine, wet stones and grapefruit set up a chunky palate with a ton of weight. Passion fruit, orange and controlled vegetal flavors are in harmony. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"A perfumed wine, this offers fresh apple and light spice flavors and considerable acidity. It is light and fruity, with a crisp lemon-zest flavor at the end. The vineyard of the Giennois is close to the city of Orléans, making it the most northerly Loire vineyard. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Pungent pyrazine-heavy aromas of bell pepper and asparagus are typical for this winery. A chunky palate is oily in feel, while vegetal-leaning, green flavors of pickled citrus fruits end with a salty note."
Sauvignon Blanc,"While the nose is pungent and true to the variety, there isn't much else positive to say about this cypher of a Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is plump yet fizzy, while the flavor profile offers citrus, bitterness and nothing more."
Sauvignon Blanc,"The scent of orange peel and white flowers set the scene for a crisp wine with linear flavors of tangerine and mandarin. It is refreshing on the tongue, with a zesty finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a new line of label-driven wine meant to be adventurous and whimsical. Catchy label aside, the wine inside entirely delivers in well-integrated fruit and floral characteristics, showing the crispness of its stainless-steel fermentation. Tangy, it's both tart and tropical, finishing focused and lean."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Citrus and crushed stone notes start this wine off, followed by lemon sorbet on the palate. It's lightweight, a real summertime refresher, with a short, clean finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"With an average age of 45 years, the Chevreau family's vines bestow intensity and richness. This is a generous wine, the green fruits lifted by good acidity and a taut mineral texture that comes from the chalk in the soil. This wine is young but very ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,A smooth and rounded wine that is full of ripe fruits. It has a hint of steely texture and minerality but the white fruit is the immediately attractive aspect of the wine. Drink this wine now.
Sauvignon Blanc,"Not a bad price for a Sauvignon Blanc of this interest. You'll find a burst of pine-apple, lemongrass, fig and vanilla honey flavors, with the dryness and scoury acidity you want in this variety. Partial barrel fermentation adds a creamy richness to this polished wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This steely, flinty, medium-bodied wine has spent no time in oak, allowing it to express its peach and pineapple fruit with purity and abundance."
Sauvignon Blanc,This wine is packed with the purest stream of citrus flavors. There is a herbal background to the fruitiness along with acidity and a bright aftertaste. It's a wine to drink young for its delicious fruit.
Sauvignon Blanc,"This appellation remains a standout for the variety, as evidenced by this 100% varietal wine that's mouthwatering in stone fruit and cantaloupe flavors. The aromatics center around pretty jasmine and lime zest aromas, while the palate is structured, crisp and fruity, all in good measure."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This producer's style is for rich wines and this is no exception. With its depth of fruit and ripe apples and lemon, it is both crisp and full. The wine has some wood aging not for the flavor, more for the open effect. Drink the wine now."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Lime and green melon aromas are a bit less than clean and pure, and the palate serves up a pile of jalapeño and bell pepper, with some lime in the background. Short on the finish, and kind of dilute."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Fermented in neutral French oak and kept light and bright, this wine is sourced from two high-elevation vineyards (both estate) above the producer's winery, including La Perla at 1,100 feet. Ripe in voluptuous white peach and pear, it's lush yet balanced, offering tawny toffee and vanilla, yet finishing in more complex lemongrass. The blend holds 5% Sémillon."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Tight aromas of yellow apple, green pear, lemon sorbet and slate are sharp and wound-up in this bottling. The palate is light without much complexity, just simple flavors of apple and lime."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Pink grapefruit, gooseberries and a floral accent mark the attractive bouquet of this winner. Round melon, kiwi and natural spice flavors do a dance on the palate, which also features red currants and more of the grapefruit present in the nose. The finish is lengthy and amply layered, so it goes out the way it comes in: with class."
Sauvignon Blanc,"For a large-production wine (47,000 cases made), this is nice and easy to drink. Tropical fruit aromas are lightly citric. In the mouth, this is fresh and easy, with nectarine and tangerine flavors. Freshness and simplicity are this wine's calling card."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Huge flavors in this creamy wine, exploding in pineapples, limes, kiwi fruit and peaches, with a tangy edge of gooseberry. It's dry and acidic and clean. Tastes a little honey sweet, but the tartness balances."
Sauvignon Blanc,Flinty notes of smoke with glints of ripe yellow stone fruit and mandarin peel make for an appetizing opening. The palate is rounder and fleshier but toned by citric freshness and enticing spice. An unusual Sauvignon Blanc that enriches the varietal genre.
Sauvignon Blanc,"This is a prickly wine, with a strong blast of nettle and green herb aromas. It has weight and texture on the palate, while the flavors of citrus fruits and salad greens are pithy and mildly bitter. Green and white pepper notes dominate the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,"This wine checks all the Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc boxes. It's medium in weight and ably marries some green, leafy character with white grapefruit notes. The lasting impression is of an herbal grapefruit sorbet that leaves behind a clean, refreshed palate."
Sauvignon Blanc,"Like most Sancerre producers, Roger also draws on vines across the Loire in Pouilly-Fumé. This ripe full wine shows the richness of this appellation and also its potential for aging. Its lime and green-plum fruits are shot through with acidity and balanced by a tangy rich texture. Drink from 2018."
Syrah,"The Oak Cask in the name is evident in the bacon, vanilla and creamy berry aromas that open things up. The palate, however, is fairly acidic, making the fruit taste bright and feel zesty. Flavors of cherry and plum are distinctly red in character, and the finish is quick and lean."
Syrah,"A rich spicy nose paired with plum and red berry is followed by earthy, dry, French-style Syrah flavors. Classic and restrained and a food-friendly winner, the wine has structure and a lingering finish."
Syrah,"Coming mostly from Stillwater Creek Vineyard, this wine is co-fermented with 4% Viognier. Dark fruit and orange peel aromas mix with sweet barrel spices. The blue fruit flavors are sweet and lush, carrying some warmth along with them."
Syrah,"Deliciously bright and spicy, its cranberry and raspberry fruit is highlighted with pepper and cinnamon. With more breathing time it fleshes out, fills in with pretty pie cherry flavors and some pleasing toastiness."
Syrah,"The components of this wine are all over the place, with blackberry and currant fruit, 100% new oak, brisk tannins and acidity needing to come together for harmony. Whether or not they will is a guess. Right now it's rustic, but dry and complex enough to drink after a good decant."
Syrah,"Oaky chocolaty aromas and candied berry notes make for a rich opening. This is tannic and bracing in feel, with peppery, herbal berry flavors that are fully oaked. A dark toasty finish offers some residual cream and chocolate."
Syrah,"With mint gumdrop, graphite and black fruit on the bouquet, the invitation is open. Feels generous but a little sticky and grabby, with black fruit flavors, char, toast and licorice on the palate. Finishes toasty and dark, with lasting grabbiness. Drink now through 2014."
Syrah,"This bottling is the winery's most expensive wine, and usually its best. Production of the '08 was unusually low, resulting in amazing concentration. It's basically a detonation of cherries, raspberries, currants, cola and mocha. New oak is present, in the form of delicate toast and wood spice, but is balanced. So silky and delicious now, you can drink it, but the tannic balance suggests the cellar. Will evolve over the next 12 years, maybe longer."
Syrah,"Displaying exceptional single grape/single vineyard particularity, this tight and focused wine delivers pinpoint flavors of berries, berries and more berries. Light streaks of cola, earth and baking spices bring further complexity and interest. Drink now or cellar through 2024."
Syrah,"Aromas of spice cake, licorice, moist earth, pie cherries and kirsch, with flavors that follow suit. A luxurious wine, bursting with flavor, tannic and just a bit pruney. This is a love it or hate it style; you pick."
Syrah,"The distinct black and white pepper nose on this wine by Siduri's Adam Lee evolves into gingerbread and cinnamon, all backed up by riper scents of blackberry extract. It's light in density, but pops with black cherry and more berry flavors, all carrying a citrus-like tannic grip."
Syrah,"Vanilla, coconut and baking spice aromas are at the fore, with the wood primary. The palate is rich and full bodied, with dark fruit and oak spice flavors. There are some good things going on but the oak—half new American and half seasoned French—rides right over them."
Syrah,"Cortes de Cima was one of the earliest producers of Syrah in Alentejo. The style is full of ripe fruit, structure and a fine juiciness. Touches of spice are a reminder of the natural flavors of the grape. With its tannins, it will age and can be drunk now– 2018."
Syrah,"This wine offers perfumed aromas of clove, blue fruit, orange peel, toast and wild flowers. The flavors show restraint, with fruit and barrel flavors lingering on the finish."
Syrah,"Quite dark in the glass, this wine, which is made with 6% Viognier, shows the darkest of purple fruit scents on the nose, and needs quite a bit of time to start opening up, so tightly wound it is. The grippy, tangy and acid-driven texture is what compels the palate, where flavors of blackened blackberry, savory dried beef and char rise firm tannins deep into the finish."
Syrah,"Aromas of gun smoke, blue fruit and herbs are followed by palate-coating cherry and chocolate flavors. The finish is impressive."
Syrah,"This wine is brooding, with aromas of dark cherry and game. The palate boasts bold fruit and savory flavors along with slightly bunched-up tannins."
Syrah,"From a small vineyard in Los Olivos, this wine offers boysenberry, lavender, rosemary and a touch of oak on the nose. Intriguing pine tar, bay leaf and eucalyptus resin show on the palate, which gives depth to the deep black fruit."
Syrah,"No punches are pulled on this hedonistic wine with its aromas and flavors of blackberry, chocolate and barrel spice. It's rich and high octane but maintains a sense of balance."
Syrah,"Cedar, herb, mushroom and woodspice aromas are followed by tart cranberry and flavors that show some astringency. The wood gets out front."
Syrah,"This hot and heavy wine by Michael Gill is probably passing its peak right now, but it currently offers tobacco, stewed prunes and balsamic-glazed beef aromas. The flavors are a bit oxidized, which gives a nutty milk chocolate and brownie flavor, but the acidity and tannins are falling out. Drink now or the score drops dramatically."
Syrah,"The folks at Jaboulet have nailed the texture of this wine, which is pure silk in the mouth. Mild hickory and menthol notes accent raspberry fruit, while slightly meaty, herbal and savory notes add complexity. Approachable now, it should easily evolve through 2025."
Syrah,Light volatile aromas distract from this blend of Seven Hills (75%) and Les Collines vineyards. The fruit flavors seem a bit leaner than expected and also somewhat dried out.
Syrah,"Zaca Mesa was the first winery to plant Syrah in Santa Barbara County. This wine comes from that 3.5 acre block planted in 1978, and shows deep plum fruits, sweet tar and cedar on the nose. The palate offers asphalt, black rocks and cracked pepper that spice up a sour plum-skin fruit profile."
Syrah,"A whirlwind of aromas—peppered black cherries, elderberry, caramel, toast, barrel smoke—rise off this appellation blend from German-born winemaker Matthias Pippig, who handcrafts small batches on Santa Barbara's Eastside. It's very soft on the palate, with medium-dark flavors of butter-crusted plum pie and an herbal note of pine pitch keeping it serious."
Syrah,"Focus and precision describe this wine. Subtle aromas of grilled herbs and wood smoke precede dark flavors of just-ripe black cherries and blueberries. A sleek texture of firm tannins and refreshing acidity gives a lot of personality. It is medium to full bodied, and will only get better with time. Best after 2020."
Syrah,"This Syrah, which blends 11% Counoise, is all about darkness, offering baking spice, blueberry, roast lamb, thyme, and espresso notes on the nose. It hits the palate with creamy power, its acidic backbone bolstering the pleasing tannic softness, and shows dark berry, milk chocolate, charred beef, and crushed peppercorn flavors."
Syrah,"Clifton Hill Syrah looks and smells the way you'd hope it would, black in the center, purple/garnet at the edges, peppery and loaded with sweet grapey fruit. Viognier skins—not juice—added to the fermenter elevate the aromas with floral and citrus accents. It's juicy and fairly light in flavor, but clean and very fresh, with no new oak."
Syrah,"This is a very opulent bottling by Steve Martell, who blends 83% Syrah, 16% Grenache and 1% Mourvèdre to deliver aromas of black-plum sauce, hot licorice, hoisin and buttery pie crust. Rounded milk chocolate flavors show on the sip, melted atop the rich and ripe core of black cherry and cassis. It's a tad hot on the tongue."
Syrah,"This is Terre Rouge's priciest Syrah, a barrel selection of the best lots. It's a big wine. No, make that huge. Godzilla-esque. Just explodes in the mouth with massive flavors of blackberry and black cherry jam, milk chocolate, anise, cedar and pepper. Finishes bone dry, and the tannins are also gigantic, but very finely ground. You need to cellar this puppy. Best after 2010, for about six years."
Syrah,"Ripely opulent, it's explosive in blackberry jam and red currants, with the grilled meat bone and black pepper notes of a cool-climate Syrah. The tannins are strong, but finely ground, while the acids will cut right through meat fat. Give this lovely young wine until 2016–2017 in the cellar."
Syrah,"From a vineyard near Carneros, this inky, dark wine bursts with blackberry, clove and smoke aromas. Fantastic concentration of fruit; deep, plush and opulent. The depth of flavor is enormous, yet it's so supple and balanced. Very fine now. Try it with game."
Syrah,"Solid but generic berry fruit aromas are clean and come with herbal, minty edging. There's no shortage of acidity, so the palate has a sharp, crisp feel and tart, oaky flavors of berry and plum. Sheer, hard, tart and dry on the finish."
Syrah,"This is a big, powerful wine, in the Pride style. It's massively constructed, with concentrated blackberry jam and currant flavors. The drawback is a green, vegetal streak that prevents meaningful aging."
Syrah,"Aged in French oak puncheons, this youthful, citrusy, big and smoky wine seems to flicker in and out—like an old movie—with each sip revealing a different view of the landscape. Herb, cacao, cassis and balsamic flavors intertwine. The lengthy finish is balanced and structured."
Syrah,"Very dense in the mouth and full-bodied, with a dry, soft feeling. Lots of toasty oak, too. Feels somewhat inert, but the delicious cherries, toast and spices make it a pleasant sipper."
Syrah,"One of Chile's more personality-driven Syrahs is Maycas, from Limarí. It's a condensed, meaty and structured wine with mineral, toast and ribald blackberry aromas. The palate is rich but well built, with plum, berry, herb and chocolate flavors. Warm and long on the finish, and layered. Sophisticated enough to give the world's better-made Syrahs a run for their money."
Syrah,"While thick and dark, this brawny Syrah is elegantly structured, firm, and aged enough to be a wise choice with food. It tastes of wild blackberry—just picked—dripping off the vines."
Syrah,"Dusty and toasty aromas over sweet plum fruit, with a streak of mocha running sharply down the center. Svelt and open, yet still sharp and showing a little bite in the back."
Syrah,"Winemaker Sabrine Rodem strips wines down to their essence in her Ex Anima line, showing the savory side of this cool-climate Syrah. Black peppercorn, rosemary, cola and blueberry aromas show on the nose, while the palate packs cracked pepper, ripe olallieberry and dried beef flavors with tarry tension."
Syrah,"Aromas of coffee, mocha, spice and dark fruit lead to full-bodied, layered fruit and barrel flavors. There's plenty of power but it doesn't sacrifice nuance."
Syrah,"Roasted meat, rosemary, peppercorn, dried flower and blackberry notes show on the wondrously gamy nose of this wine. The palate echos that savory style, with generous lamb, char, dark berry and peppercorn flavors."
Syrah,"This dark, young wine is brooding. It's hiding itself in a purple velvet cloak, revealing only hints of spicy blackberry fruit and smoked meat. The tannins are chewy, but yielding, like gum. It's a very beautiful wine that will improve for a couple years in the cellar."
Syrah,"This bottled-aged beauty, made by Syrah expert Andrew Murray, is redolent on the nose with lavender, violets, dense black fruit and a touch of tar. Great depth and structure show on the chewy palate, with black flavors of tar, espresso and nearly fudge complementing the rich yet tangy red-cherry fruit."
Syrah,"The aromas jump up, with mesmerizing notes of fresh herbs, green olive, violets, orange peel, smoked meat and huckleberry. The palate shows a light but pillowy texture alongside flavors that carry on the finish. It's all about subtlety."
Syrah,"Brooding smoke, purple fruit and violet aromas are followed by sumptuous fruit and barrel flavors in this Syrah. Barrel notes linger on the finish, feeling a bit raw but not detracting from the overall enjoyment."
Syrah,"A big-boy Syrah named for the producer's daughter, this is a jammy, juicy, brown sugar and maple syrup kind of Syrah, with a great peppery nose and a lot of bacon fat flavors intermingled among the soft tannins."
Syrah,"Plump black currant, lavender extract, bright purple flowers and touches of raw beef and tar show on the nose of this bottling, made with 20% whole-cluster and 7% Viognier. Black pepper and asphalt show first on the palate, where tannins softly coat the mouth and then stand up to boost elderberry flavors. Thorough, zesty acidity ensures long cellar potential. Drink 2017–2032."
Syrah,"Roasted beef and bacon fat scents meet with maple, char, Concord grape and blueberry on the nose of this hearty bottling from a winery recently acquired by O'Neill Vintners. Its tannins are deep and firm but welcoming, providing the framework for black currant, blueberry, charred beef and rosemary flavors."
Syrah,"Bold, powerful aromas of white pepper and blackberry explode, with a more mature bouquet of dried rose petal and sweet cigar box. Soft, lush tannins frame pure, supple berry fruit. Perfect now. —S.H."
Syrah,"Dark and fragrant, this interesting Syrah opens quickly with blue and black berries, a streak of balsamic, and suggestions of bloody meat. Off to a great start, it thins out through the finish, while remaining interesting with surprising complexity."
Syrah,"Peppery! Mounds of freshly crushed black peppercorns erupt from the glass, giving the blackberries and currants a spicy finish. Shows real class and elegance for the price."
Syrah,"Cortona is known worldwide for two things: the book Under the Tuscan Sun and wines based on Syrah. This informal expression shows great varietal character in a no-fuss, fruity style. Aromas include cherry, cassis and crushed white pepper."
Syrah,"From young vines, this wine offers up pretty scents of rose petals and lightly peppery strawberries. Just 5% Mourvèdre was included, but its presence brings a dash of extra spice and herb."
Syrah,"Purple/black and compact, this wine needs plenty of breathing time to reveal its layers. Klipsun vineyard fruit brings power and tannic muscle. The aromas are intriguing; a bit overripe and raisiny, but also offering truffle, smoked meat and burnt toast."
Syrah,"Perhaps one of the best wines for the money available right now, Andrew Murray delivers aromas of cherry, blackberry, lavender and a white pepper wow factor on the very inviting, florally driven nose. The wine looks silky in the glass, and flavors of black cherry, anise, violet and oregano are easily accessible to a wide variety of palate preferences."
Syrah,"A dense, full-bodied red, this opens with aromas of blackberry jam, vanilla, oak and a whiff of herbs. The robust palate delivers fleshy black cherry, cracked black pepper, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. You'll also the notice the heat of evident alcohol, especially on the close, which throws it somewhat off-balance."
Syrah,"For those who want a little funk in their Syrah, this conjures up flavors reminiscent of wines from the Rocks District in Walla Walla. Credit the rocky soil of this Similkameen Valley vineyard, which delivers dense, well-knit flavors of red and purple fruits, smoke, tanned leather, tobacco and licorice. Concentrated flavors of raspberry purée hold down the core."
Syrah,"Smelling of pure Syrah, annotated with rock and white pepper, this is graceful, muscular and compact. The wild blueberry fruit is not too sweet and has a clean, resonant finish. It still needs time to knit together and bring the barrel flavors into focus."
Syrah,"Blind, you could be forgiven for thinking this is the winery's flagship, Homage Syrah. An intoxicating nose of baking spices, blueberries and boysenberries leads to a palate with ample weight and plush tannins. It's complex, earthy and spicy, but with a beam of lively, just-ripe fruit from start to long-lived finish. Drink this stunning value through 2023."
Syrah,"Resplendent in white pepper, aromatically defined by it in fact, with a touch of cedar, this is a smooth, full-bodied Syrah that's mighty good, a duet of cool and warm-climate character. Pair with braised meats thick in earthy mushrooms."
Syrah,"Earns a high score for sheer richness and decadance. Huge in blackberry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate, bacon, pepper and oak flavors, wrapped into big, velvety tannins. Impresses for its size, but is totally dry, and retains balance and elegance. Now–2015."
Syrah,"This succulent Syrah ages 12 months in oak to produce a soft and deeply concentrated wine with penetrating aromas of smoked ham, curry leaves and drying mineral tones. It has a thick, velvety mouthfeel and firm tannins."
Syrah,"The nose on this wine is delicate at first but then opens up quickly into ripe blackberry, marionberry jam, asphalt and grapeseed oil aromas. It's juicy on the palate, with ripe black cherries and wild berries, but clings to a graphite character in the core as well as a bit of espresso-bean bitterness."
Syrah,"From the somewhat cool 2010 vintage, this Boushey vineyard Syrah is moving into secondary fruit flavors of strawberry preserves. A leafy, lightly herbal component adds extra texture and length."
Syrah,"This is consistently one of Zaca Mesa's best Syrahs of several bottlings they produce every vintage. The mildly cool year was kind to the fruit, giving controlled blackberry and black currant flavors that are wrapped in refined tannins. The wine finishes with a swirl of smoke and peppery spice, plus a touch of warmth from the alcohol. Drink now–2015."
Syrah,"This deep ruby-colored wine has a bouquet of black cherry with hints of smoked meat and red bell pepper. Flavors of smoked meat and cherry pie with notes of orange peel never completely coalesce. There are some pleasant moments on the palate, but they don't all come together at the same time."
Syrah,"Solid Syrah character is evident—pomegranate, wild berry, and gamy streaks of soy and earth and peppery spice woven into the flavors. Light chocolate adds interest to the finish, but some chalkiness (from unintegrated acids?) detracts from the finish."
Syrah,"All coming from Block 1, this wine was fermented 65% whole cluster and aged for 20 months in neutral barrels. Pretty aromas of spice, flower, herb, cherry and earth give way to a full fruit-forward palate that shows a dazzling sense of purity and richness while also maintaining its restraint. It's a bit of a stylistic departure for the winery in terms of its richness but it still delivers big time."
Syrah,"Spicy and supple, this has aromas of cured meat, white pepper, toast and dark plum that follow the warm robust palate along with dried black cherry, coffee and licorice. Round tannins provide the supple framework. Drink through 2020."
Syrah,"Mostly from Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills vineyards, this wine has aromas of cherry, green herbs, pepper and flowers, with the Petit Verdot (15%) showing through. It's brawny in feel, with coffee and cherry flavors, chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids."
Syrah,"Peppery and herbal, with thin, tight veins of wild black fruits. It's an elegant style, with underlying minerality, though weighted toward a European palate."
Syrah,"This leads with light raspberry, plum, vanilla and barrel spice aromas. The palate is lighter still, mixing fruit and barrel qualities in equal proportion and finishing on a baking spice note. The oak is a little intense."
Syrah,"This feels a bit tough and gritty, with stringy tannins that give the palate a rustic texture. The flavors are ripe, with notes of cherries, licorice and mocha. Drink now."
Syrah,"Pure Syrah from Pepper Bridge, Seven Hills and Ash Hollow vineyard fruit, this shows the maturing of Walla Walla vines, which more and more reveal the earthy, herbal, garrigue qualities of the grape. Coopered in neutral oak, it showcases the typicity and regionality of the grape. Funk, earth, seaweed, green tobacco, and a hint of pepper dominate. You might wish for more fruit, but for those who love the funk this is a fine bottle."
Syrah,"This bone-dry, full-bodied Syrah has firm tannins and intense concentration. It's a little warm in alcohol, with flavors of dark chocolate, blackberry jam, cassis liqueur, grilled bacon and black pepper, plus a coating of sweet, smoky oak. You might want to give this wine a year or so in the cellar to let everything meld together."
Syrah,"This full-bodied, richly tannic wine delivers. It starts off with savory notes of cracked pepper, black olives, violets and cedar, then eases into concentrated flavors of blueberries and roasted meat before ending with a flourish of firm, dusty tannins. Give it a few years to soften. Drink 2020–2030."
Syrah,"Expensive, but worth it. Absolutely a first-rate dry red wine of great substance and authority. Shows full-bodied blackberry flavors with a meaty, leathery edge and hints of violets, tobacco, pepper and cocoa. Such is the tannic structure that the wine should develop through 2012."
Syrah,"Young and spicy, this is bursting with bright fruit flavors of cranberry and cherry. Flavors of cola and Dr. Pepper come through also, and the up-front freshness carries throughout. Enjoy this lovely wine now through 2018."
Syrah,"Intriguing in tobacco and a sense of the forest, especially pine, this soft, chewy, fuller wine finishes quickly in black pepper."
Syrah,"This wine is immediately attractive and seductive, with forward floral notes of crushed iris and violet that are supported by a decadent ripe-fruit core of black raspberry, wild cherry and boysenberry. Woody tones of toasted coconut and vanilla add richness to the dense, fully structured palate, while hints of black pepper and cocoa nib blossom on the finish. Delicious now, but should age well through 2018."
Syrah,"Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas produces this label with her father and winemaker Joey Tensley, whose handiwork unleashes aromas of white pepper, black cherry, a cornucopia of dark berries and earthy minerality. Bright acidity on the palate partners with blackberry soda flavors, quite racy for the variety."
Syrah,"Though Viognier only makes up 1% of this wine, it substantially lifts the aromas, which bring notes of wild flowers along with blue and black fruit. The flavors are bold and full bodied, pulling no punches but showing exquisite concentration and length."
Syrah,"Formerly doing business as “Shiraz,” this Syrah from Bisquertt offers a huge purple tint, roasted aromas of blackberry and campfire, and a ripe, grapey palate that brims with simple, racy black cherry, pepper and other driving flavors. Not timid by any means but also nothing out of the ordinary."
Syrah,"Quite oaky, the barrel flavors not yet integrated into the fruit, this starts out rough, then rolls into clean, light, pleasant boysenberry fruit flavors. Should continue to improve with more time in the bottle."
Syrah,"This is an aromatically appealing estate Syrah with the Viognier (4% co-ferment) at the fore with notes of flowers and orange peel backed by Syrah's smoked meat, pepper, and earthy funk. The palate is light in body and flavor, not quite matching all of the intensity the aromas have to offer."
Syrah,"Lots of complex flavors in this bone-dry wine, and they range well beyond berry-cherry fruit into more interesting realms of leather, coffee, unsweetened cocoa, bacon, pepper spice and minerals. The wine shows a brisk acidity, and the tannins are intricate. Feels a bit austere and aloof now, withholding its best. Should offer more in 3-5 years, but not much beyond that before the fruit collapses."
Syrah,"Barrel aromas are up front, with notes of vanilla, dill and wood spice in front of dark fruit. The fruit flavors are plump and plush, with vanilla notes lingering on the finish. There are lots of good things going on here but the wood gets in the way—a shame as the fruit is impressive."
Syrah,"Still tight and chewy, this lushly-fruited Syrah mixes berry and cherry flavors with earthier, mineral-driven bass notes. It will require a bit more bottle age to unwind and decompress, but it has all of the ingredients of a wine with staying power."
Syrah,"Fermented in 100% stainless steel, this priced-to-sell Syrah has some red fruit and violet character. On the finish it tastes slightly burnt."
Syrah,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable wine, from the first whiff of cranberry and pine needle through the smooth finish that offers the faintest hint of butterscotch. A network of barely-there tannins supports agreeable flavors of cranberry, slightly tart cherry, butterscotch and sage."
Syrah,"Rubbery, somewhat funky aromas shift toward iodine and stewed blackberry. A dense palate houses rubbery tannins that are short on structure. Baked blackberry, plum and cassis flavors finish toasty, herbal, leathery and salty."
Syrah,"This is just 14.2% alcohol, so despite the richness and ripeness, this is not fat or flabby. The fruit has concentrated black cherry and cassis flavors, and the smoky, pain grillé flavors of barrel aging are nicely integrated. Aromatically this wine is just beginning to evolve, with complex plum, prune, cherry liqueur, coffee and smoke."
Syrah,"A fancy Syrah, dry, complex and interesting to drink. It packs in a lot of blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, accented with a sweet jacket of smoky oak. The alcohol is a bit high, resulting in some heat. Drink soon."
Syrah,"Astralis has become one of Australia's top collectibles, and Roman Bratasiuk's 2005 version is once again top-shelf stuff. It's full-bodied and rich without being over the top, balancing dark-chocolate-covered blackberries and blueberries with more complex savory notes (spice, grilled meat). While it's a big, hulking wine at first, the finish shows great elegance and finesse, ending with silky tannins. Best from 2014. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited."
Syrah,"A bit crude in tannins and with some green flavors, but not bad for this price. Gives enough blackberry, licorice and cedar flavors to satisfy, and the finish is dry."
Syrah,"Inky black, thick and juicy with a mélange of berry flavors. Laced around the voluptuous fruit are threads of dark chocolate, and the wine seamlessly moves into a finish with even darker notes of toast, char and coffee grounds. For all of its power, it keeps the alcohol in the mid-14% range, with no burn at all."
Syrah,"This selection shows pure black-cherry fruit on the nose, then it folds in hints of flowers, spices, chocolate and coffee on the palate. It's full bodied and creamy in texture without being heavy, then finishes long. Ready to drink, but should easily hold another 5–6 years."
Syrah,"This cool-climate bottling from the young producer shows tons of florality and spice, from violet and lilac to white pepper and dried herb, underscored by blueberry and tar aromas. It's light and lithe in body, with elderberry, potpourri and pepper flavors, but the tannic tension is most compelling, clinging to the palate from start to finish."
Syrah,"This wine offers notes of toasted vanilla bean, herbs and red fruit. It's broad in feel while the fruit flavors are elegant in style, with the supple feel bringing much of the enjoyment."
Syrah,"The cool vintage shows in the brisk acidity, hard tannins and herb and mineral flavors that accompany the usual blackberries and spices. There's plenty of elegance, with the wine showing a highly refined structure. Drink now–2014."
Syrah,"Only 30 cases of this gorgeous wine are imported, so snag what you can when you find it. It's a deep and complex Syrah, exuding attractive aromas and flavors of juicy red cherry and fresh raspberry spiced up with accents of vanilla crème, sweet wood, soft Earl Gray tea and whole baking spice on the close. Creamy and lush with a silky texture; drink now–2014."
Syrah,"This wine is drenched with dark fruit flavors, like blackberries and boysenberries, and fills the mouth with a velvety texture. It's just so expressive and generous, without much oak influence, that it comes off as simply delicious. Best after 2018."
Syrah,"This starts off feeling soft and open, but the acids gain momentum on the midpalate, lending plenty of zip. A mild, oak-influenced plum flavor marks the quick-to-fade finish."
Syrah,"With complex aromas of cedar, tobacco, tree bark, herbs and blackberry, this lush, tightly packed Syrah gets off to a fine start. A mouthfilling palate with baked but controlled flavors of boysenberry, leather and chocolate finishes long, minty and with classy herb flavors. For a modern, oaky Syrah, this is excellent. Drink now through 2017."
Syrah,"Regina is Renieri's super Tuscan with a feminine soul. A pure expression of Syrah, the lush wine is soft, velvety and enduring in the mouth. Its momentum holds strong thanks to afternotes of berry fruit, leather and black pepper."
Syrah,"Enormously rich, a powerhouse Syrah packed with ripe red and black currant, cassis, blueberry, chocolate, coffee, cedar and spice flavors. The structure earns the wine extra points, with ultra-refined tannins and crisp acidity. Decadent, and at its best now, in its flashy youth."
Syrah,"This starts with concentrated boysenberry and raspberry fruit, but in the mouth some off-flavors intrude. The fruit is close to raisined, and the finish carries a hint of plastic. Two bottles tasted, consistent results."
Syrah,"This limited-production Syrah (3,200 bottles produced) spends 18 months in French and American oak, providing a sweet spice and chocolate backdrop to the wine's bright red berry aromas and flavors. Accents of foresty foliage and black pepper add additional complexity to the lush mouth. Drink now–2014."
Syrah,"Ripe aromas of blueberry, acai fruit and grape candy get touched by smoked meat, crushed herbs and a slight mint. Leather and tar flavors emerge on the palate, but the fruits and spice characteristics are wound up in incredibly firm, mouth-drying tannins, which are overwhelming right now."
Syrah,"Ruben “The Grape Whisperer” Solorzano may need a new cellar-oriented nickname if he keeps turning out such excellent bottlings. This offers lots of white and black pepper on the nose alongside thyme, rosemary, black plum, licorice, black olive, roast beef and Mediterannean spice. The palate packs thyme, peppercorn, dried sage, black and green olive, espresso and green coffee beans atop underripe blackberry and strong elderberry flavors."
Syrah,"With 20% Petite Sirah blended in and aged in a mixture of American, French and European oak, barrel notes of vanilla and sweet spices play nicely against plump, jammy red fruit aromas and flavors, with the oak leading the way on the finish."
Syrah,"Floral and mineral aromas tell you this isn't run of the mill, and seeing that it's from the emerging Elqui Valley in northern Chile, it's not. Aromas of violet petals and slate rise above the norm, while the palate is rich, slick and tastes of truffle, licorice, pepper and blackberry. Fairly stylish and ready to drink now. Good complexity for a value-priced wine."
Syrah,"Bright cherry and berry aromas get support from grainy, lightly lactic oak. This Syrah is balanced and fresh, with a mild sensation of tartaric acid on the palate. Flavors of loamy berry fruits are mildly spicy but lack serious complexity."
Syrah,"The perfumes are the central theme of this wine, aromas of roses and flavors of spice, cinnamon, going through the ripe fruit and suggestions of wood. It is a superripe wine, but one which manages to keep in balance."
Syrah,"Full-bodied and concentrated, this opens with aromas of crushed black plum, spicy blueberry, vanilla and dried sage. The dense, warm palate delivers dried black cherry, blackberry extract, oak and black pepper alongside velvety tannins. The soft acidity shows the heat of the vintage, so enjoy soon."
Syrah,"The aromas show appealing notes of orange peel, mortared flowers, spice, black olive and raspberry. The palate sports ripe but silky fruit and earth flavors, showing a very pretty sense of styling."
Syrah,"There's a lot to like in this soft, juicy wine, bright in red fruit and notable in its gentle texture. Quietly powerful and full-bodied without being overdone, it has balance and elegance, with a meaty underbrush."
Syrah,"Richness defines this ripe Syrah. It dazzles with blackberry and cherry jam, dark chocolate and exotic spice flavors, while firm tannins provide supportive structure. Oak adds additional tannins and a smoky, toasty coat. Drink now and through 2015."
Syrah,"Deep and dense aromas of olallieberry and black plum integrate with vanilla bean and lilac on the nose of this bottling by Steve Martell, formerly of Sextant Winery. A soft mouthfeel unleashes well-integrated flavors, with lavender, pepper, baked blackberry and charcoal simmering to the surface through intense acidity. Great now, it will last many years."
Syrah,"The aromas of embers, black pepper, dark fruit, herbs, smoke and spice are brooding and locked up on first pour, showing more on each swirl. The blue and black-fruit flavors are ripe, sweet and full, with savory notes fleshing out the crazy long finish."
Syrah,"One of the few Syrahs from this cool-climate vineyard on the appellation's western edge, this bottling is an expert take on savory, with black and white papper, crushed rosemary, potpourri, oregano and anise seed spicing up the fresh-pressed boysenberry fruit. A wondrous array of peppercorns and tart black fruit show once sipped, with elderberry and underripe black currants mixed amongst fennel, dill, oregano and charred meats."
Syrah,"The 2011s from Cornas show high levels of ripeness, and this négociant wine is no exception. It's almost pruny, with other notes of meat, clove and cinnamon, yet remains crisp and firm, picking up hints of black olive and espresso on the finish. Drink now–2025."
Syrah,"Another of the producer's 100% varietal, single-vineyard wines, this is a lovely quaff, dark black in color and attitude, with a taste of black olive tapenade. Sanguine and medium bodied, it has a thick, peppery finish balanced in minerality."
Syrah,"It's pure Rosenblum, as sweet as a confection, as delicious as a filling made from blackberries, cherries, chocolate, licorice, cinnamon, vanilla and white sugar. It's impossible not to be impressed and troubled by a wine such as this."
Syrah,"The aromas seem a bit muddled, with notes of red fruit, herbs, vanilla and flowers. The cherry flavors are tart, with a kick of acidity on the finish."
Syrah,"Mineral, mulberry, dried herb and black-fruit aromas lead to layered dark-fruit flavors that show intensity as well as exceptional balance. This has a delicious factor that is impossible to ignore."
Syrah,"If you liked the winery's far more expensive “1772” bottling of Syrah, you'll find an approximation of it here, at about half the price. Dry and balanced, with typical Edna Valley acidity, it's marked by black cherry, red currant, licorice, chocolate-covered mint and peppery spice flavors."
Syrah,"This wine seems to reach out to the mainstream: flavors and aromas of sweet vanilla, cinnamon toast and brown sugar are met with lightweight red fruit, a soft balance and just a touch of white pepper. Inoffensive on all counts, but lacks the depth needed to set it apart."
Syrah,"A full 13 years old, the aromas are still vibrant, with notes of cranberry sauce, leather, vanilla and baking spice. The palate displays a beautiful sense of balance between the fruit and barrel flavors. It's in an absolute sweet spot right now but still has life in front of it."
Syrah,"Dusty aromas of red cherry are muddled by oaky notes of plastic and latex. A jumpy, bright palate is rudimentary, as are lightly spiced plum and raspberry flavors. A fresh, dry, basic finish seems appropriate."
Syrah,"Smooth and sultry purple fruit and flower notes get more specific on the black pepper and blackberry elements in this bottling from the family's original blocks, planted in 1992 and 1993. The palate is both dynamic and straightforward, with nuanced blueberry-blackberry fruits decorated by peppery spice that dances across solid structure into the long finish."
Syrah,"This is a perfumed wine, with aromatic notes of raspberries, kirsch, flowers, smoked meat, orange peel and blue fruit, with the Viognier blended in (4%) showing itself. The raspberry and cranberry flavors are lush and focused, showing a dazzling sense of purity that carries through the finish. It only lengthens its stride on the second day open."
Syrah,"This is a crisp, aromatic Syrah, with notes of earth, iodine, anise, pepper, clove and cassis threaded throughout. The balance of all the elements, including acid and tannin, is spot on, and the length through the finish suggests it can age for five or six more years."
Syrah,"This new project by wine bar owner Ash Mehta and winemaker Mary Bradley shows much promise, starting with woody elderberry, tar, black pepper and dense lavender on the buoyant nose. The sip starts with powerful pepper and then coalesces around cassis and black-currant fruit, a tarry minerality, dried herbs of thyme and juniper and a cocoa finish."
Syrah,"Aromatically pleasing, this suggests fresh blueberry pie, with a whiff of smoked meat. It's straightforward with huckleberry and mocha flavors, trailing slightly toward the finish."
Syrah,"This Temecula Valley producer designated this bottling California but it's just as good as many of its single-vineyard designates and Temecula Valley appellation Syrahs, perfumed with violet and blackberry jam and fleshy in mouthfeel with tastes of plum and tobacco."
Syrah,"This blend of grapes from four vineyards—48% Alamo Creek, 18% Bien Nacido, 18% Spanish Springs and 16% Ventana—offers dense berries and smoke on the nose as well as black pepper and tar. The tar shows strongly on the palate, as do blackberry blossoms and denser black pepper spice."
Syrah,"A blend of three new Syrah clones that were fermented separately, then blended into a satisfying, though still young and somewhat jagged wine that will benefit from more bottle age. It comes out toasty and gamy, with undertones of cured meat, stiff tannins and moist earth. The classic Boushey vineyard flavors of herb, green tea and cured meats are here in abundance."
Syrah,"Aromas of ground violets, charcoal, smoke, iron, black fruit, tar and salami lead a salty, briny, expressive palate that shows depth concentration and elegance. A long finish caps it off."
Syrah,"Aromatically this wine is not yet entirely ready to reveal its charms, with reserved notes of mineral, smoked meat, olive brine, fire pit, peat and crushed flowers. The generous earth and savory flavors feel rich and full, leading to a lengthy finish."
Syrah,"Mike Sinor is taking his fans on an experimental ride through his new oceanview vineyard, here presenting a rich take on Syrah. It's lush on the nose with olallieberry and blackberry fruit as well as rich bacon fat, vanilla bean and milkchocolate notes. Concentrated black cherry thrives on the palate alongside caramel and vanilla cream."
Syrah,"Clean purple fruit aromas mix with grapeseed, Concord grape and caramelized black fruit scents on this bottling. Black plum, peppercorn, tart elderberry, tar, beef char and soy show on the palate, which is lifted by a lavender nuance."
Syrah,"This treads the line between slightly rustic and refined. The tannins are sandpapery, and it has lots of zingy acidity, making the wine feel a little rough. But the core of blackberry fruit is rich and dynamic. Probably not an ager, so give it a good decanting, and drink it over the next 2–3 years."
Syrah,"A very awesome array of burnt bacon, dried violets, chipped asphalt and tart elderberry show on the nose of this bottling from a remote vineyard north of the Santa Maria Valley. A strong pepper spice starts the sip, followed by charred berries and black currants, tons of purple flowers and a persistent acidity."
Syrah,"This 100% Syrah wine opens with ripe black-skinned fruit, roasted coffee, leather and cedar aromas. The full-bodied, concentrated palate offers dried blackberry, espresso, white pepper and star anise flavors, bolstered by ample, polished tannins. Enjoy through 2021."
Syrah,"This young Syrah is marked by jammy berry, cherry and mocha flavors, wrapped into an elegant structure of soft tannins. Sweet new oak adds a lovely touch of toast. Round and mellow in the mouth, it should develop additional nuances with up to six years in the bottle."
Syrah,"To judge by the blast of white pepper and strong tannins, the Northern Rhône is the model for this dry, single-vineyard wine. It is a distinguished Syrah, but too tannic and closed down now for thorough enjoyment. Best to cellar for 3 or 4 years, maybe longer, until it throws some sediment."
Syrah,"Whiffs of balsamic vinegar and dusty minerals lend a savory, rustic tone to ripe black cherry and berry flavors in this full-bodied Syrah. The palate is concentrated, but it's a bit sharp and unrefined. The finish is modest."
Syrah,"Now a strong focus for the Tranche estate, this is inky purple/black in the glass, almost impenetrable, and lushly aromatic with dried berries, plums and cherries. A generous vein of vanilla and tobacco—from 28 months in French oak—leads into chewy, ripe tannins."
Syrah,"It's the stem inclusion that shows itself first, with aromas of olive and herb in front of violets, red fruit, pepper, earth and whiffs of coffee and smoked meat. The flavors are reserved, supple and polished, with bright acids keeping it all in focus. It demands food alongside it to be properly appreciated."
Syrah,"Once again, here is a Seven Hills wine that opens with truly lovely aromatics. It's a clean varietal expression of Syrah, with medium weight, wild berries and finishing highlights of pepper, earth, sea salt, baking spices and cassis."
Syrah,"As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare. Plum, black cherry, leather and black pepper jump from the glass, slowly and with purpose, around a core of burly tannin and intensely floral aromatics. This is a great wine."
Syrah,"True to the Syrah variety, this plush red wine offers bright fruit tones of blackberry and cherry backed by light spice and clove. It's an easy, soft ensemble that would pair with meat, chicken or pasta."
Syrah,"This is a late release wine, but a bit of a boon for wine drinkers, who may open and consume it at will. Light cranberry, licorice, root beer and coffee flavors meld, with plenty of supporting acidity. It's a modest wine, with a quick finish, but drinks nicely at the moment."
Syrah,"This is 100% Syrah from three vineyards: Funk, Les Collines, and Ranch at the End of the Road. Seamless, sexy scents of blue and purple berries, vanilla, licorice, black tea and cut tobacco swirl up from the glass and carry through to the palate. One third of the fermentation include whole clusters, adding savory flavors to the finish. An elegant Syrah for lovers of the grape."
Syrah,"This rich Syrah is a pleasure to drink with lamb and beef dishes. It has an excellent structure, softly tannic and silky in the mouth, with long, luscious black cherry, blueberry, beef teriyaki, sandalwood and spice flavors. Only 100 cases were produced."
Syrah,"Interestingly, Sidewood's 2008 Reserve Shiraz comes in considerably lower in alcohol than the regular bottling. It features a complex interplay of herb, spice and olive that gives it a stylistic resemblance resemblance to northern Rhône Syrahs. The tannins are silky, the finish long and balanced. Drink now–2018."
Syrah,"Tasty and dry, this offers typical smoky, black peppery aromas, dark fruit flavors and medium body. It comes off as elegant rather than big, due to the smooth texture, slightly subtle flavors and silky texture."
Syrah,"Soft foliage notes lead on the nose of this wine, with supporting aromas of strawberry, raspberry and stewed rhubarb. The medium-weight mouth offers moderate tannins and a good streak of lifting acidity, resulting in a texture like crushed satin. Fruit-skin flavors linger on the medium-length close alongside accents of pepper and sweet spice."
Syrah,"From an organically grown, seven-acre vineyard that was planted nearly 40 years ago comes this savory, cooler-climate-styled Syrah. It's redolent with cracked black pepper, soy, charcoal and tar on the nose, plus an underlying lavender and black-currant sweetness. The palate is very tarry and peppery, with flavors of dried elderberry and roasted lamb with a rosemary touch."
Syrah,"Give this Syrah a good decant to take the edge off the fresh tannins and acids. It's a gritty, resilient wine notable for its wealth of blackberry, black cherry, currant, beef jerky, anise and pepper flavors, accented with sweet, smoky, caramelized oak."
Syrah,"This has oodles of ripe boysenberry and huckleberry in the aroma, and the overt fruitiness continues in the flavors. A nice touch of oak sawdust in the aroma comes off more like a touch of sweetness in the flavors. There is a rich mouthfeel, soft tannins and full body. It's enjoyable and easy to drink."
Syrah,"Syrah is quickly gaining popularity in Hawke's Bay and this is a good example why. Reminiscent of a Crozes-Hermitage, this wine's meaty, peppery aromas and blackberry-boysenberry fruit aren't overpowering, just nicely balanced and very drinkable over the near term."
Syrah,"There is nothing shy about this wine, but the ripeness and high alcohol are beautifully handled. It remains precise and focused, with deep black-cherry, cola and coffee flavors. The tannins are fine grained, and the acids are sufficient enough to give it a frame and the prospect of aging for up to a decade."
Syrah,Spicy grassy aromas of catmint are matched by unusual clove scents. A tough rubbery palate is where you'll find spicy blackberry and green-herb flavors. Pulling tannins are the driving force on this wine's choppy clipped finish.
Syrah,"Boysenberry, cassis, woodsy spice and leathery aromas hit the right chords. This feels tight and juicy due to bright core acidity. A combination of spicy plum and red-berry aromas are intense and turn feral upon airing, while this limestone soil-based Syrah tastes of coffee, pepper, plum and various spices on a powerful finish. Drink through 2021."
Syrah,"Grapy aromas and tart fruit flavors make this a lean, edgy wine that's not overtly fruity or rich. But the smell of wood smoke and blackerries, and the tart black cherry flavors are vivid, energetic and mouthwatering."
Syrah,"This Syrah, blended with 9% Cabernet, tastes of dark fruit, tobacco and leather. But there's an odd aroma lurking in the wine's background that's hard to pinpoint and not entirely pleasant."
Syrah,"Wonderful purity is on display in this mineral-driven, tart, racy and expressive Syrah from the estate vineyard. The bright and tangy berry flavors may strike some palates as a bit on the sour side, but there is more than enough ripeness here for most. This is succulent and classy."
Syrah,"This majority-Syrah was fermented with a tiny handful of Viognier, both grown on a certified-organic estate vineyard. With a touch of licorice and leather in the mix, it offers funk that may or may not be of interest to every palate and should be enjoyed sooner rather than later."
Syrah,"Suave blueberry-chocolate notes meet with light and delicate violet florality on the nose of this single vineyard bottling from the Bay Area-based producer. The palate is lively and tart with underripe blackberries, sesame oil and a sizzling acidity."
Syrah,"Incredibly syrupy aromas of concentrated blueberry, blackberry, dried black cherry and kirsch show on the nose of this dense and dark bottling. It is a hearty sipper, with lots of espresso bean and cappuccino flavors, more dried cherry and blueberry, and some soy. The cooked flavors are a little overpowering but also luscious."
Syrah,"An interesting, even eccentric Syrah that's really quite different from anything else out there. No mere fruit bomb, it's a meaty wine, in the sense of being chewy, but also in the aromas and flavors of both roasted and raw beef. That's not to mention the extraordinary blackberries and currants, dusted with a blast of freshly ground black pepper. First-class and unique."
Syrah,"Excellent varietal character, along with the lightly funky aromas associated with the vineyard's location in the Rocks (a sub-section of the Walla Walla Valley AVA), elevate this first release from Riverhaven Cellars. Along with blackberry fruit come cinnamon, mocha, coffee grounds and clean earth, well integrated into a rich and textural wine with good length and body."
Syrah,"All of the fruit for this wine comes from Catherine's Block at Dineen Vineyard. It shows bright fruit-forward aromas of blueberry pie, orange peel, flowers and smoked meat. The flavors are full yet show a sense of restraint, pulling up a bit on the finish."
Syrah,"A black pepper and cardamom aroma starts this wine off spicy. The flavors continue the thread with even more pepper plus beefy, dark-fruit notes and full body to carry them along. The wine feels high-octane on the palate, but is moderate in alcohol."
Syrah,"This wine is a blend of fruit from Ranch at the End of the Road and Ciel du Cheval vineyards. Brooding aromas of dark raspberries, black plum, spice and mineral are followed by ripe generous full-bodied fruit flavors that display a lot of hedonism while retaining a spot-on sense of balance. It's sensational."
Syrah,"This is 100% Syrah from the Boushey vineyard. It's so compact that it's almost impenetrable, but the gorgeous aromas portend a glorious wine given appropriate bottle age and/or breathing time. A dark, dusty mix of black fruits, black olives, black coffee and licorice, this has such density that it's almost impossible to separate out all the fruit layers, let alone the earthier components that make it so distinctive. At 14.8% alcohol, this may be the biggest Betz Boushey Syrah ever."
Syrah,"Like its companion Syrah from Cedar Ridge Vineyard fruit, this is pure varietal and spent 18 months in American oak. Earthy and somewhat bitter flavors of charred wood and espresso dominate the cassis fruit. The finish is chalky and tannic."
Syrah,"This wine opens with aromas of earthy funk, steak tartare, potpourri, pepper and earth, showing outrageously minerality. The flavors are dense and textured, leaning hard into the savory with abundant flower and fire pit notes that linger effortlessly. It's a very cerebral wine but with no shortage of hedonism."
Syrah,"Here's an edgy wine, a walk on the wild side. Explosive aromas of blueberries, crushed white pepper, earth and smoke lead to slightly sweet wild-berry flavors, packaged in very silky tannins, although the acids are fine. It's a big wine, making up in chutzpah what it lacks in finesse."
Syrah,"Lifted by 8% Carménère and Viognier, it's straight down the fairway with notes of blueberry, orange peel, pepper and brambly fruit. Lighter in style, it tapers toward the finish."
Syrah,"A gorgeous Syrah, sumptuous and seductive, with a texture of sheer silk and satin. Beyond that, the flavors are rich and complex, offering satisfying waves of blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, cassis, milk chocolate, anise, pepper and toast. Really fine, with a good backbone of tannins. Now–2011."
Syrah,"Sharp scents of clove, cherry syrup and tobacco lead into a rough, tart and tannic wine with no particular varietal character."
Syrah,"This wine's aromas are bright and fruit forward, with generous black pepper, raspberry, fresh flower, smoked meat and barrel spice notes. The full-bodied palate delivers cranberry flavors that are appealing but more ponderous than the aromas might suggest."
Syrah,A palate of exotic perfumes with layers of dark chocolate and dense tannins certainly give this wine great power. It is dark and brooding—almost too much in the intensity of its flavors and structure. It's going to remain a big beast as it ages. Drink from 2017.
Syrah,"Savory aromas of black pepper, dried beef, soy, tangy elderberry, fresh boysenberry and deep lavender show on the nose of this single vineyard study. The palate is very floral at first, and then flavors of black currant, vanilla, pencil lead, baking spice, tar and white pepper ride the waves of acidity."
Syrah,"Very dry, tannic and full-bodied, with somewhat underripe tobacco, pepper and herb flavors behind the blackberries. More like a minor Zinfandel than a Syrah. The toughness and grittiness need softening meats and cheeses for balance."
Syrah,"A bit light and tight on the nose, this shows condensed strawberries and dried beef aromas before diving into a palate of purple berries. It's an easy-drinking, well-made wine for everyday sipping, just not showing much extra pop."
Syrah,"This wine is full-bodied and extraordinarily rich, with massive blackberry and blueberry jam, Canadian bacon, sandalwood and pepper flavors. It's so sweetly delicious, you just want to keep on drinking. Almost too much of a good thing, though."
Syrah,"Flashy and voluptuous. Santa Maria Valley Syrah always has an enormous depth of fruit, spiciness, rich tannins, bright acidity and a firm minerality, and that's just what you'll find in this bottling. It's marked by ripe blackberry, chocolate, bacon and crushed pepper and clove flavors that should drink well over the next six years."
Syrah,"Cherry, raspberry compote, anise, vanilla, wood spice and medicine-cabinet aromas are followed by lighter styled fruit and savory flavors, with the tannins bringing some grip."
Syrah,"This complex Syrah has a surprisingly deep, dark red color, almost like a Port, but it's not nearly as heavy as it looks. It boasts intricate flavors, a firm but not fat structure, and signature cool-climate Syrah characteristics of black pepper, wood smoke, plum and grilled meat flavors. Medium-bodied and silky textured, it sips smoothly and leaves you wanting more."
Syrah,"Spice, leather, pepper and plum mingle in this medium-weight effort. Purple fruits and intimations of ginger cookie are in play, with pretty baking spices on the finish."
Syrah,"A little soft, but delicious and complex. It has waves of raspberry, cherry, sweet cola, red licorice and oaky cedar flavors, with a spicy edge of smoked meat, like cured salumi. Feels elegant, although it lacks the structure for aging, so drink now."
Syrah,"Rubbery berry, tea, cool mint, herb and savory aromas amount to something a bit funky. This Syrah feels chewy and tannic. Herbal, savory, soupy flavors finish with an infusion of tea-like influences on closing plum and berry fruit notes."
Syrah,"The oak is far out in front, with the aromas of vanilla, dill and freshly hewn wood making it difficult to find the fruit. Cranberry flavors struggle to get to the surface. It's technically well made but the barrel treatment completely overrides any sense of the variety."
Syrah,"This wine's intense berry aromas are followed by equally deep flavors, as its meaty, earthy, spicy nuances develop with each sip. It has complexity, concentration, a very smooth texture and that certain wild element that's attractive in Syrah."
Syrah,"Aromas of tire rubber, herb and red fruit lead to soft, plush cranberry and cherry flavors that linger."
Syrah,"This is a hearty, full-bodied red, blended with just a tease of 1% Viognier. Baked bread, plum jam and soft tannins highlight a juicy, burly celebration of high-toned acidity and leathery texture, remaining near-velvety on the palate through the lengthy, peppery finish."
Syrah,"Aromas of freshly rubbed mint are followed by vanilla and just-hewn wood. The plum flavors are plump yet restrained, showing a fine sense of balance, with abundant oak accents surrounding them. The oak is far out front but there is still much to enjoy."
Syrah,"Aromas of dry brush, wiry cherry and road tar open this Syrah. In the mouth, high acidity creates sheer angularity. Plum and tart black-currant flavors are staunch and rubbery on a mildly abrasive finish."
Syrah,"Browned butter, cinnamon-like spices and blackberry pie frame this Syrah from an estate vineyard owned of Zaca Mesa, the first winery to plant the grape in Santa Barbara County. There is more brown spice and blackberry on the palate, which is couched in an appealing tannic structure that smooths out as you drink it."
Syrah,"This is less luxuriantly ripe than some of the other 2013 Hawke's Bay Syrahs, showing some firm, dusty tannins on the finish, but it's still a terrific offering. Cracked black pepper, fresh blueberries and cedar notes come together beautifully on the palate, promising much for the future. Drink 2018–2025."
Syrah,"This is possibly the most savory rendition of Syrah made on the Central Coast, each vintage as feral as the last. This bottling shows bloody lamb, crushed peppercorn, soy and barnyard elements on the nose. The palate is tense with tarry structure, revealing unusual kelp, stewed peppercorn, black miso and teriyaki flavors."
Syrah,"Dried spices, cracked pepper and roasted meat notes scream of Syrah and the Northern Rhône. It's medium to full in body, but with fine tannins and bright acidity, making it remarkably easy to drink. Approachable now, it should still be drinking well through 2030."
Syrah,"Co-fermented with a small amount of Viognier, this wine opens in a flurry of sunflower before unleashing bold, firm flavors and layers of dense tannin and concentrated blackberry and cherry. The tannin continues to expand on the finish."
Syrah,"Tight and unyielding, with a dominating Band-Aid streak that does not disappear even after many hours of breathing time. There is some Walla Walla Syrah berry and loam character evident, and the vineyards are first rate (Seven Hills and Pepper Bridge), but the reductive, plastic flavor masks much of the fruit."
Syrah,"A huge disappointment, coming after the previous two vintages. This '05 is Porty sweet and sharp in acids, with extreme, medicinal flavors of blackberry jam and raisins."
Syrah,"There's a lot of slate minerality on the nose of this bottling, alongside bright and fresh boysenberry fruit and a pine-needle character. The palate is tart with plum skin and grippy tannins, well balanced and also showing just the right amount of barnyard funk."
Syrah,"This is the winery's least acccessible 2008 Syrah. It's too tannic and acidic to be properly appreciated, although decanting will help to unleash the massive blackberry, black currant and chocolate flavors. Cellar it through 2010 if you can."
Syrah,"This is a soft, silky-textured version of Crozes-Hermitage. Hints of cedar accent black cherry and licorice aromas, while the flavors are super ripe, verging on jammy. It's already approachable, and should drink well through 2020."
Syrah,"Condensed violets and rose petals greet the nose on this wine from an appellation just south of the Santa Lucia Highlands. Other aromas suggest grape candy, blackberry jam, anise and a touch of bacon fat. It's lively on the medium-bodied palate, with olallieberries, black pepper and crushed dill, proving very flavorful."
Syrah,"Waves of rich bacon fat, maple, caramelized black cherries, campfire smoke and an elegant touch of lavender show on the nose of this bottling, which includes 14% Counoise. Similar smoke shows on the palate, but it's more tart and acidic than expected, with underripe blackberry and black plum skin flavors. The tannins are fine-grained but firm. Drink 2018 through 2023."
Syrah,"The Suma Kaw Syrah from Hank Beckmeyer is an intriguing combination of great site and experimental winemaker. It's woody and herbal with a menthol sheen and an unexpectedly bright crispness contrasted by dark, savory meat and smoke. A wine that'll start conversations, enjoy it with roasted, herb-encrusted meats—the culinary equivalent of the wine."
Syrah,"In 1978, Zaca Mesa became the first winery to plant Syrah in Santa Barbara County, and Winemaker Eric Mohseni keeps pushing the quality. This offers notes of blueberry cobbler, rocks and fresh-turned soil, followed by blue fruit flavors, dark chocolate, leather and slight asphalt."
Syrah,"Incredibly dark in the glass and potent on the nose, this bottling from west of Paso Robles shows dried blueberry, black currant, black pepper and asphalt aromas, proving thick but not sweet. The wine coats the palate with lavish tannins and bright acidity before delivering flavors of charred berry and peppercorn."
Syrah,"Rich, dry and tannic, this Syrah has elaborate flavors of dried plums, blackberries, coffee, dark bitter chocolate and black pepper. It's a complex wine, compromised only by the heat of 15.4% alcohol."
Syrah,"Aromas of vanilla and baking spices take the lead, followed by dark fruit. The palate is all about texture, showing a creamy richness to the fruit and barrel flavors that linger. The oak plays a prominent role but it generally works."
Syrah,"Brooding blackberry, dark plum, dried herb, vanilla and bacon fat aromas are followed by sappy, rich, saturated fruit flavors in this wine. It's a hedonistic rendition of Syrah that holds nothing back."
Syrah,"Bennett Valley is a cooler section of Sonoma County, and maybe the cool vintage was just too much. This wine isn't quite ripe.It's bone dry, acidic and tannic, and the fruit is herbal."
Syrah,"Smoky, charred meat notes add complexity to flavors of blackberries, cocoa, cedar and spice in this St. Helena Syrah. Its tannic complexity lifts the palate to nobility. Dramatically dark in color and rich in profile, it's the winery's best bottling since 2008. It needs a few years to meld, so drink from 2015–2017."
Syrah,"Built for aging, this tightly wound, elegant and yet grand wine is sure to develop more nuances and smoothness with time. It smells enticingly like cedar, tobacco and dark chocolate-covered blueberries, yet retains a firmness and reserve that doesn't let those melt into richness on the palate quite yet. Store this confidently in a cool place and enjoy it 2020–2025."
Syrah,"This is made in the style of an Aussie Shiraz, a big, powerful wine that stuffs the mouth with fresh, jammy fruit and spice flavors. It's very dry and crisply balanced with acidity, and brings to mind smoky, barbecued meats and poultry."
Syrah,"A fleshy, full-bodied Syrah with a streak of gingerbread flavor that's got a bite of heat on the finish. This is a wine for people who like a bolder, higher-alcohol style."
Syrah,"Here's a Syrah with bursting aromas of mature blueberry, cherry, spice and smoked bacon. The wine is full, round and generous with a supple feel and soft concentration. Pair it with lamb or roasted pork."
Syrah,"This is a tempting and sylish wine. A seductive aroma influenced by new oak resembles toasted baguette slices, cedar and cardamom, then generous flavors like ripe black cherry and blueberry come on. It's medium to full bodied, broad and smooth in texture with enough fine-grained tannin to give it some heft."
Syrah,"This well-aged wine has a slightly earthy, new-leather aroma. Tasty, spicy flavors meet up with rich black cherry and cocoa chords to resonate through the finish. It's medium to full bodied, well balanced, moderately tannic and ready for the dinner table. The winemaker kept it in barrels for an unusual 43 months."
Syrah,"A little floral/grapey scent comes up from the glass, then the wine descends into darker, grippier, more tannic levels with boysenberries and smoke. There's lots of acid—maybe too much—and it gives a sense of something missing as the wine heads into the finish. Green, earthy, chewy tannins leave a slightly harsh impression."
Syrah,"Chopped herbs, licorice and a bit of smoke lead the nose on this affordable wine. It's thinner on the palate, with more licorice that spices up the red fruit flavors. The finish shows some tannic grip."
Syrah,"This bottling, from seven cool climate vineyards, makes a great intro into savory Syrah, showing all that peppery might without shoving it down the throat. Cracked peppercorn is redolent on the nose and palate, with the latter also showing raw lamb and beef char. The sip tends toward soy and leather, but with a core of dried blackberry fruit that's familiar to most palates. The texture is tightly woven."
Syrah,"This spicy and forward wine offers firm blackberry and black cherry fruit accented with savory olive flavors. Its vanilla and baking spices notes suggest some time in new wood, and a hint of Dr. Pepper comes through on the finish. Syrah is definitely a strength at this winery."
Syrah,"Black in color and rich in aromas of grilled meat, Papa's is thick and concentrated, offering bold flavors of damson plum, leather and cola spice. Full bodied and ripe, its ability to showcase crisp acidity amid all this flavor and texture is remarkable."
Syrah,"Tight at first, this has a fine tannin structure that wraps around the wine like a scarf. The aromatics come with force, with intoxicating wafts of violet, pepper and herb."
Syrah,"A splendid Syrah, black in color, dry, tannic, acidic and rich in blackberry, currant, grilled meat, black pepper and toasty oak flavors that are incredibly complex and satisfying. Testarossa has a great history with this bottling, and while the wine doesn't have the immediately dazzling luxuriousness of the 2007, it's more ageable. Drink after 2016."
Syrah,"Winter spices like cinnamon, clove and nutmeg waft from this full-bodied and complex wine, joining gentle black-cherry flavors on the palate. The texture is smooth and caressing, and its richness lingers on the finish."
Syrah,"A special spot for Syrah, Parmalee-Hill gets plenty of coastal fog and coolness, providing this gamy, silky 100% varietal wine with structure and buoyant acidity around a balanced weight of tar, black olive and dark cherry."
Syrah,"Tight, tannic and bone dry, this ultralow production wine comes from the small, somewhat obscure Sonoma Mountain appellation. It aims high, with the Northern Rhône the model. The blackberry and black currant flavors have an edge of smoky oak. Judging from the way the wine gains interest in the glass as it warms, it should have a fine future."
Syrah,"The winery's single-vineyard Syrah spent 20 months in 50% new French oak. It has an appealing mix of black cherry fruit and citrusy acids, with a hint of stone. The tang of Meyer lemon resonates long after the first swallow."
Syrah,"This very dry wine is dominated by its hard tannins, and comes across as a bit rigid and austere, especially by California standards. Yet it's very finely structured, with a keen edge of black pepper to the currant and blackberry flavors buried way beneath. Give it through 2009, but if you must drink now, decant."
Syrah,"Aromas of vanilla, baking spice, herb and dark fruit lead to tart, full cranberry and cherry flavors. Coffee notes linger on the finish and the tannins provide a gentle grip."
Syrah,"This tart, lean wine is not welcoming, but earthy, lively aromas and sour-cherry and tart raspberry flavors give it personality. The tannins are severe and sharp, too. It tastes light in alcohol and high in acidity so there is no hurry to drink it. Some mellowness and maturity may develop by 2018."
Syrah,"The fruit is fading in this Syrah, although you'll still find some cherry flavor. There's also an overripe, raisiny edge that makes it hard to appreciate."
Syrah,"Lovely delineation here, the berry/cherry fruit framed with coffee and chocolate from a 50/50 mix of French and American oak barrels. The surprise is the addition (via co-fermentation) of 6% Viognier, which stabilizes color and gives a pleasing, floral/citrus lift to the scents and flavors. Good balance and follow through."
Syrah,"Barrel aromas take the lead with notes of vanilla, dill and coconut followed by cherry, herbs and mesquite. Flavors are tart and medium bodied, with the fruit outpaced by the wood."
Syrah,"Also sourced from the McKinley Springs vineyard in Washington's Horse Heaven Hills AVA, this is the regular Syrah compared with the Opulence, the reserve. The wines are clearly differentiated, the Envy showing rougher edges, tougher tannins and a more tannic, earthy character. There's a strong herbal streak also; this wine definitely needs hearty foods to complement it."
Syrah,"A standout in the portfolio, this is a sleek, strong effort with tart purple fruits and mineral underpinnings. There's an ample whiff of smoke and a general earthiness around the tannins, with a hint of iron ore. The chalky finish is the only distraction."
Syrah,"Herb, cherry, smoke, cedar, vanilla and coffee aromas are out front, with the Cabernet Sauvignon blended in (18%) showing itself. The palate is rich but well balanced, with coffee flavors lingering on the finish. It doesn't seem entirely varietal but it brings plenty of appeal."
Syrah,"Firm and tart, this is a rather light, earthy, herbal take on the grape. Its blueberry and blue plum suggestions are bound in an unyielding frame, with a whiff of rubber ball on the nose."
Syrah,Whiffs of spice and dark toast lend warmth to ripe black cherry aromas on this Syrah-Viognier blend. The palate is brisk with tart cassis and plum flavors wrapped up tightly within layers of mouthfilling tannins.
Syrah,The leanness of this wine brings out acidity without fruit weight. It has a juicy character that is fresh and dominated by red berry flavors. It is not for long term aging.
Syrah,"Some wineries releasing a new Garys' Syrah would charge a lot more, but Novy keeps their prices moderate. While this wine is enormously tannic and dry, it shows a complex range of blackberry and stone fruit, tobacco, currant, charred meat bone, black pepper and mineral flavors, with the oak influence evident but subtle. Given the extreme dryness and tannins, as well as significant alcohol, the question is will the wine age. It doesn't seem likely to, so decant and drink up through 2020."
Syrah,"Luca D'Attoma and Elena Celli's new biodynamic Syrah exhibits opulent layers of soft chocolate, spice, red berry, leather and lingering tones of vanilla bean. In the mouth, the wine is chewy, tart and bursting with plump fruit flavors."
Syrah,"This is a current release from Joe Davis, who holds his wines back until their prime. Hailing from Ballard Canyon, it shows black plum, pressed purple flowers, tanned leather and balsamic notes on the nose. There's a pleasantly yet softly structured texture to the palate, where dried blackberry, roast beef, lilac and Concord grape flavors arise."
Syrah,"This is a rich, flamboyant Syrah. The Central Coast appellation is because the grapes are a blend of Santa Barbara's cool vineyards and a warm one from Paso Robles. It's a good recipe, with ripe, forward flavors wrapped into a firm structure. Only 150 cases were produced."
Syrah,"At the moment, the nose on this wine seems tight: It offers only subtle aromas of wild berry and cedar. Medium to full bodied, the palate bears a note of roasted herb, and the energizing acids and sandy tannins keep the wine structured throughout the finish."
Syrah,"Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this has a nice peppery lift. The fruit flavors seem less forward, with the herbal components much more front and center. It's made from a clone specific to the Cougar Hill Vineyard, showing cool climate flavors with subtle grace. Given a full 24 hours of breathing time, it opens further into a dazzling, rich mix of cherry and cassis that's soaked in an herbal broth."
Syrah,"Full-bodied and layered, this is a stellar example of the variety, exhibiting elegance beneath a broader exterior. Black pepper and blackberry wrap around dense tannins and a robust texture. The wine is co-fermented with Viognier to bring a floral note to the bouquet."
Syrah,"From Montemaggiore Vineyard on the western hills of the appellation, and containing 5% Viognier, this is a well-made wine, nicely rustic in a dirty, rowdy mix of black pepper and earth. Dense, thick layers of cocoa play with floral notes of lavender and rose, finishing softly. This will age well through 2023."
Syrah,"An exotic collection of olive, rubber, blackberry, blueberry and cardamom aromas stirs interest. The palate is at first high in tartaric acid but later reveals itself to be loamy and chunky. Baked flavors of blackberry and earth finish short, salty and blocky, with a reverberation of pointed acidity."
Syrah,"A little on the soft side, which limits ageability, but an awfully good wine. It's rich and dense in ripe blackberries, currants, teriyaki beef, cola, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors, wrapped into dense but fine tannins. Drink now."
Syrah,"Give this Syrah another year or two in the cellar. Even though it's a 2009, the blackberry and cherry fruit remains startlingly fresh. Yet the acid-tannin structure is balanced. Should start picking up earthy, meaty notes by 2014."
Syrah,"Done in the rich Paso style, this bottling shows fresh blackberry jam, crushed thyme, rosemary and vanilla on the seductive nose. The lavish palate offers espresso syrup, caramel and dense vanilla-laced blueberry. It's a great bottling for those who love a rich and decadent style."
Syrah,"Aromas of dark raspberries, blackberry seed, iron and earth are at the fore on this fruit-focused wine. It offers a dazzling sense of purity and richness along with exceptional balance and an endless finish that kicks it up a notch. The freshness is arresting."
Syrah,"This is a dry, robust Syrah, packed with blackberry, blueberry, anise, bacon and pepper flavors, and wrapped into sturdy tannins. Give it a decant, and drink with game or Mexican beef dishes."
Syrah,"An average, slightly raw Syrah, with edgy tannins that finish with a bit of a scowl. Packed inside are blackberry, currant, cocoa, pepper and herb flavors."
Syrah,"Black olive, boysenberry, graphite and cracked pepper season up a slightly gamy nose on this bottling from a popular Los Alamos vineyard. The flavors are a study of blackness, with peppercorns, asphalt and deep purple fruits that are both dark and tart, all framed by a boisterous acidity."
Syrah,"There's a touch of barnyard on the nose of this bottling, which also shows a soy and sweet black cherry scents. The palate is marked by beef char and cooked black fruit flavors, with a twist of funkiness, lending intrigue."
Syrah,"This is an extremely restrained Syrah, offering black olive, tapenade, asphalt, damp grass and garden herbs on the nose. The palate shows tar, green coffee bean and Kalamata and green olives, proving intriguing if obscure."
Syrah,"Intriguing all around, this displays earthy notes of truffle and meat on the nose, and balanced flavors of full raspberry and spicy caramel on the palate. Though a touch angular, the wine has elegance and good fruit."
Syrah,"Good for Burgess for holding this Syrah back for a little while. It's beginning to soften, just barely. The tannins are still strong, but you can taste those bright blackberries and cherries starting to show meaty hints of wild grilled portobello mushrooms. It will drink well in late 2014 with hearty roasts and stews."
Syrah,"Syrah is not new in Southern Oregon, but finding a consistent style has been a battle. Progress is being made. Tannins are tamed, alcohol is kept in hand, and the fruit is plenty ripe; maybe just a bit too ripe. Here the flavors are of strawberry preserves, leafy herbs, and lighter but still-astringent tannins. The wine fades fairly quickly, and should be consumed in its youth."
Syrah,"Tangy boysenberry and elderberry fruit shows on the nose of this sultry bottling, along with thyme, potpourri and licorice. The flavors are more cooked than fresh, recalling charred blackberry, dried blueberry, leather and licorice. It's a hearty wine that consumes the entire palate."
Syrah,"This excellent single-vineyard varietal Syrah is thick with blueberry/boysenberry fruit. A real crowd-pleaser, the aging for 22 months in half new French oak layers in smoke and coffee liqueur. Powers does a fine job of achieving ripeness and keeping alcohol levels in check."
Syrah,"Gamy roast lamb aromas meet blueberry and crushed bay leaf on the nose of this bottling—a shining example of Syrah from southern Santa Clara County. White pepper, thyme and graphite notes show on the palate, where a core of elderberry fruit core is enhanced by that feral, gamy quality."
Syrah,"This deep-violet colored wine has a bouquet of cherry and butterscotch. Powerful tannins lay the groundwork for bold fruit flavors of blackberry and cranberry laced with notes of butterscotch, pipe tobacco and cocoa. It is full in the mouth, with a lingering finish marked by a pleasing vein of bright acidity."
Syrah,"The label—a grinning winery dog—is irresistible. The wine is a bit sharp, with a green edge to the tannins and a strong streak of vanilla, perhaps from some sort of oak treatment."
Syrah,"Perfumed and floral, crisp and modulated in acidity, this is an exuberant expression of the variety. Ample acidiy and cherry and orange flavors unfold on the palate, followed by a brisk finish that's laced in spicy nuance."
Syrah,"Oaken layers make themselves known from nose to finish, with notes of cream, vanilla and cinnamon. The fruit thins out midpalate, revealing bright acidity and insistent tannins. A good pour for an everyday dinner."
Syrah,"This rich Syrah beguiles with its soft, velvety texture and delicious flavors of blackberry, chocolate, bacon and black pepper. High in alcohol, but a fine follow-up to the very good 2007. Drink now."
Syrah,"Hailing from one of the state's premier Syrah sites, this wine leads with aromas of berry, coffee, chicory and violets. The flavors are supple, backed by lightly grainy tannins."
Syrah,"Tannins mark this big, dry Syrah. It shows Spring Mountain's intensity of fruit, in this case blackberries, but that tannic bitterness dominates, making the wine difficult to appreciate. It's hard to imagine it aging."
Syrah,"Expressive aromas of smoke, embers and blue fruit are followed by a full-bodied flavorful palate that still shows elegance. The finish lingers."
Syrah,"Coming from the highest corner of the limestone-laden vineyard at 1,275 feet—with views of the entire Santa Ynez Valley—this gives off broad, approachable aromas of lit match, bacon fat, purple fruits, pepper and smoked meats. Though full of dried cherry and smoked blueberry flavors, it's leaner in texture, with acidity that keeps it fresh. Drink 2017–2025."
Syrah,"Hailing from Olsen and Elephant Mountain vineyards, this wine brings black currant, huckleberry and dark plum aromas that smell pure and sweet. The black fruit and smoke flavors display a mixture of concentration and restraint."
Syrah,"This wine seems a bit reduced right out of the bottle. Give it plenty of oxygen, and light blueberry fruit flavors emerge. The aging in 60% new French oak brings in a lot of barrel flavors that seem mismatched with the light fruit."
Syrah,"A simple Syrah, with decent cherry, licorice and tobacco flavors that finish quick. It's dry and clean, and a certain elegance makes it a nice pairing with a wide variety of fare."
Syrah,"An early-maturing Crozes-Hermitage, with aromas of violets and hickory smoke alongside charming blueberry and blackberry fruit. There's not much tannin in this medium-bodied wine, so drink it over the next couple of years for its easy charm."
Syrah,"Earthy aromas of tilled soil, bell pepper, ripe plum and a whiff of barnyard waft out of the glass. The palate is a bit rustic, displaying fig, ground black pepper, graphite and a gamey note alongside velvety tannins. Drink soon."
Syrah,"Aromas of crushed violets, dried herb, smoked meat and plum lead to focused, pure marionberry flavors. The concentration and texture are impressive, as is the balance."
Syrah,"This starts with a smoky aroma, like charred steak over the grill. Then highly concentrated fruit flavors zoom across the tongue, along with very firm tannins and powerful, ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors backed by a mouth-coating texture. It's an unusually focused and structured wine."
Syrah,"You'll find plenty of crushed summer blackberries, black pepper and grilled meat flavors in this Syrah. It's dry in style and elegant in structure. The wine has a grip of tannins that suggests pairing with rich game."
Syrah,"Brambly berries and blue plums anchor the flavors of this lovely Syrah, sourced from the Lewis Vineyard. The balance of natural acids and lightly astringent tannins keeps the fruit razor sharp, and the highlights of red licorice add dimension. Drink now or over the next five years."
Syrah,"From a small vineyard in Los Olivos, this wine offers boysenberry, lavender, rosemary and a touch of oak on the nose. Intriguing pine tar, bay leaf and eucalyptus resin show on the palate, which gives depth to the deep black fruit."
Syrah,"Lifted and vibrant, this expressive Syrah shows great life and freshness. The red berry and blueberry fruit backbone balances the creamy vanilla and sweet smoke frame. Raspberry, cocoa-dusted cherry, coffee and anise flavors fill the round mouth with a lush, velvety texture; black pepper and baking spice notes remain through the long finish."
Syrah,"The aromas are generous, with notes of potpourri, dried herbs and black pepper. The palate is full of citrus and savory flavors that show depth and intensity along with restraint. Savory notes persist on the finish."
Syrah,"Here's a rich, ripe, opulent Syrah, all jammy blackberry, cherry and currant flavors, sprinkled with black pepper and housed in a structure of firm, strong tannins. It's a blend of some of the best vineyards in the county, including Bien Nacido, Larner and Ampelos. Drink now–2015."
Syrah,"There's lots of upfront blackberry, currant and cherry fruit in this Syrah, along with savory, meaty notes of sweet bacon and charred meat. With complex tannins but fairly soft acidity, it's an ambitious, delicious wine."
Syrah,"A 100% varietal wine from a light-handed producer, this captures a sense of muted, yet juicy red cherry around structured tannins, making for an elegant experience. Integrated oak ensures a layered, medium-bodied wine, with a leathery, coffee-like finish. Cellar through 2020."
Syrah,"This big, soft, delicious Syrah tastes like a candy bar. It's rich and sweet in blackberry jam, blueberry pie with the crust, cocoa and spice flavors, with an umami tanginess like bacon. Easy to savor it through the entire bottle, although the alcohol level is high."
Syrah,"Sourced from the excellent Lewis Vineyard, this toasty, chewy Syrah displays black cherry fruit against a strong background of vanilla. At first it seems tart to the point of being almost sour, but as it breathes, the oak mutes some of the acid and balances it out."
Syrah,"This is pure Syrah from a winemaker who makes a number of single-vineyard and blended Syrahs. This dark, sappy, seductive wine has you from the first sniff. Though the fruit is big and briary, winemaker Holly Turner manages to capture the polish and elegance of Washington Syrah in the way the flavors are sculpted together. Veins of tar, chocolate, smoke, black licorice, pepper and tobacco accent the young, tight fruit flavors. This wine definitely needs breathing time to show its stuff."
Syrah,"Roasted red berry and tangy woodsy notes on both the nose and on the palate. Finishes with more oak, plus a tart metallic-herbal note that is softened by chalky tannins."
Syrah,"That the Syrah performs well in the Alentejo is proved by producer after producer. Here it has produced a big, beefy wine, full of black, silky fruits, concentrated ripe fruits and floating perfumes."
Syrah,"Though, at present, it isn't quite as powerful as past vintages, the winery's newest Syrah still shows some classic SQN hallmarks, such as malted-milk and powdered-cocoa aromas and flavors, a smooth mouthfeel and dusty tannins. Smoke, ash and bacon fat notes appear on both the nose and the palate, as does a hint of green herb. Is, as always, an ode to ripe, juicy blackberries."
Syrah,"This is a potent, rich Shiraz. It's full bodied and thickly textured, with aromas and flavors of mocha, asphalt and plum. The overall impression is somewhat chunky and inelegant but undeniably concentrated. Give it five years or so to smooth out some of the rough edges."
Syrah,"You can smell the extreme alcohol level on this Syrah. It pinches the nostrils with heat, like a puff of white pepper. It's also overripe, with raisin and prune flavors. Drink up."
Syrah,"The first vintage of this small-production wine, this is meaty, full of smoky pepper and dense red and blue fruit. It's powerfully built and structured, packing a finishing punch of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors. A worthwhile new discovery and a producer to watch."
Syrah,"Leveled by 4% Grenache, this Syrah, which is made in Paso's Tin City district, is rich and lush on the nose. Black cherries and lavender-chocolate truffle are lifted aromatically by herbes du provence. The black-fruit-laden palate is dense with blueberries, maple syrup, dark caramel and touch of black peppercorn."
Syrah,"Aromas of green olive, tapenade, mineral, peat, flowers and earthy funk lead to plum and savory flavors. It's lighter styled and all about elegance of expression, with guava flavors on the finish."
Syrah,"A strong and tasty oak component makes this full-bodied wine an attention-grabber, beginning with the toasted aromas, then complex and spicy flavors and firmly tannic texture. While the oakiness tamps down the fruit flavors, it does make it fun to drink."
Syrah,"Scents of stewed blueberry and black cherry devolve into prunes and raisins on the nose of this bottling, but the dried ginger and dark spice elements add complexity. It's dense on the palate, with strong acidity cutting the meaty quality of the midpalate, with pruney flavors throughout."
Syrah,"Aromas of vanilla, coconut and clove mix with dark fruit and black pepper on this fruit-and-barrel-style wine. It's full bodied and high octane, needing more fruit intensity to balance it out."
Syrah,"Big and black but also heavily charred and very oaky—we're talking bulldozer oak that leaves mostly resin and vanilla on the palate. Combine that with huge tannins and extract, and what should be pleasant and fruity becomes a stampede across the palate."
Syrah,"Tough, dry and tannic, with a gritty mouthfeel that needs rich fare, like a char-broiled steak, to wake it up. Tucked inside the astringency are some cherry, black currant and black pepper flavors."
Syrah,Angular and overcrowded with rhubarb aromas and flavors. There isn't any finesse to this wine and only a modicum of acceptable fruit and body. Tart at the core.
Syrah,"This rich, exuberant, deep-colored red offers the full range of Syrah flavors, from smoke and black pepper to blackberry jam, dried herbs and roast beef. It has an assertive toasty oak overlay and very firm tannins, yet it delivers complexity, full body and real personality."
Syrah,"This single-vineyard bottling by the downtown Santa Barbara-based winery boasts a beautifully dark nose of black cherries, white pepper and elegant brown to black spices. Flavors are dominated by blackberries that rise to a grippy, mouthwatering finish. The tannins are still strong, so expect this to last for years. Drink 2017–2024."
Syrah,"Fermented 75% whole-cluster and then aged in neutral oak, this wine offers complex, expressive aromas of green olive, fresh herbs, grilled asparagus, earth and peat. The palate brings waves of intensity, with sensuous, layered savory flavors that lead to a hyperextended finish. It's an exclamation point of a wine that shows the promise of this young winery and vineyard."
Syrah,"Though labeled Syrah, this includes 25% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. The addition somewhat mutes the Syrah character, though it may bump up the concentration of cassis fruit flavor. Espresso-laden tannins put a frame around the finish."
Syrah,"Mildly smoky and toasty aromas lead to a lightly oaked palate that's largely defined by black cherry and some rich berry syrup. It's a full, colorful Syrah with a chunky mouthfeel and a satisfying but short finish. Drink now."
Syrah,"Soft and thick, this Syrah has simple, sugary flavors of blackberries, cherries and chocolate. Drink now."
Syrah,"Smelling of fig, sweet plum, raspberry syrup and vanilla, this is a meaty, thick Syrah."
Syrah,"This wine's aromas are a bit locked up at present, revealing plum, herb, clove and barrel spice notes as it opens. The palate is dense and rich, full of dark fruit flavors and generous barrel accents. It pulls no punches."
Syrah,"Made entirely from Syrah grown on its property across multiple vintages, and then cave-aged six years in American oak, this is a nice dessert wine, raisiny and brimming in Christmas spice. With plenty of body and acidity, it swims effortlessly and smoothly on the palate, a bite of decadence that will work well with rich cheeses."
Syrah,"This wine offers scents of peppered meat and ripe blackberries, then adds hints of black olive and licorice to the mix on the palate. It's concentrated and full bodied, with a richly textured, lingering finish. Drink now–2025."
Syrah,"This is quite light, with a leafy character and barely ripe fruit flavors that hint at tomato paste. Some pineapple and vanilla flavors come in, making this a rather odd, though still interesting, budget bottle."
Syrah,"This wine displays aromas of tobacco, cracked black pepper, clove and mineral. It's elegant in style with tart fruit flavors and lightly chalky tannins."
Syrah,"These are still young vines, and showing rather simple, though attractive, fruit flavors of raspberry, strawberry and red currant. Vague hints of pepper and rock suggest good things to come, but for now this is a bit of an underachiever for the price."
Syrah,"Lovely scents of violet and black fruit open this dark, sappy Syrah. The mouthfeel is sleek and citrusy, with sharp acidity and a finish amplified by barrel-influenced flavors of coffee and licorice. Give this some extra decanting time and it will open up further."
Syrah,"Concentrated, well structured and not too full bodied, this is an almost architectural wine in how it fills out the palate and clings to the taste buds. It has an appetizing texture due to fine-grained tannins, a sense of ripeness without overripeness, plus deep and layered fruit, coffee and black-pepper nuances."
Syrah,"High alcohol gives the wine heat, especially in the finish. It's also overripe, with the blackberries veering into port-like raisins and prunes. But it is thoroughly dry, with good acidity and tannins. Tasted twice, with consistent results."
Syrah,"Black currant, lavender, black pepper, soy and graphite show on the nose of this bottling by Zac Wasserman, an assistant to Joey Tensley. There is a flash of lavender at the tip of the sip, and then the darkness descends, with charred meats and blackened berries cut by a strong acidity. It still needs time to develop, but these wines disappear fast, so stock up."
Syrah,"Sultry blackberry, tobacco leaf, caramel and black pepper spice show on the nose of this well-integrated, brooding but fresh nose. The palate is rich, flavorful and vivacious, with lilac, lavender, boysenberry and olallieberry deepening into tar, char and smoked meats."
Syrah,"Very black and dense, a super-young wine that shows pedigree and promise for development. Impresses for its fine structure of thick tannins and acidity, and the way the lush black currant and chocolate fruit meets the toasty oak. Good now, and should improve for up to four or five years, at least."
Syrah,"Flavors of blackberry, black cherry and a streak of cola ignite the palate, with a layer of pure mineral underneath. At first a bit delicate, this never pauses, introducing umami and cinnamon highlights on the lingering finish. It's fresh and elegant, with a more gentle fade than some of the more potent Syrahs from Cayuse."
Syrah,"This well known négociant has turned in a sold effort. The nose is slightly herbal, but with attractive black-pepper shadings, while the fruit flavors favor dark-skinned plum. Drink this medium-bodied, supple wine over the next few years."
Syrah,"The grapes didn't get quite ripe during this cool vintage in the cool Arroyo Seco. As a result, this Syrah is dry and acidic, yet curiously high in alcohol, with a vegetal and mint edge to the blackberry fruit."
Syrah,"The aromas are brooding, with notes of ash, raw meat, smoke, herb, stem, blood orange and mineral. The palate brings a sense of freshness to the generous savory flavors, showing a bit of tannic heft on the finish that should settle with additional time in the bottle."
Syrah,"Too sweet and oaky to earn a higher score. It's rich and jammy in sugary raspberries and cherries, with lots of caramel and buttered toast. Ready now."
Syrah,"There's a warm and welcoming note of baked goods and toasty brioche on the nose of this bottling, along with hints of vanilla and black cherry. The flavors are also very accessible and delicious, with black-cherry syrup, maple, brown sugar and more vanilla spice that carries deep into the finish. The tannins are firm enough to hold up the richness."
Syrah,"Thin to the verge of being empty of fruit and flavor, this shows no varietal character whatsoever. Green, leafy, herbal and earthy flavors abound."
Syrah,"Dark and smoky, aromas of ripe blackberry and cassis come with a hint of oaky vanilla and tobacco. A lively, alert, bright palate is dense but balanced, with plum and blackberry flavors followed by notes of chocolate, toast, herbs, pencil lead and baked black fruits. Drink through 2019."
Syrah,"Impresses for the sheer volume of fruit, with explosive blackberry, cherry, cassis, chocolate, licorice, gingerbread, cola and smoky oak flavors. The structure is very fine, with rich, ripely smooth tannins and good acidity. Delicious now, and should remain so for several years."
Syrah,"Closed up tightly, this wine is not yet entirely ready to reveal its charms. Over time it offers aromas of blackberry, huckleberry, bittersweet chocolate, barrel spices and mineral. True to the house style, it pulls no punches with creamy feeling, rich black and blue fruit flavors that sail into the distance. Give it time to open up."
Syrah,"This particular bottling belongs with the very best Syrahs from this Syrah-infatuated state. A broad, toasty, full-bodied and fully realized wine, it has begun to smooth out from the extra years in bottle, but has a long life ahead. Berries, cherries, chocolate, coffee, mocha, tobacco, fungus, graphite… the flavors go and go."
Syrah,"This has the excellent acidity to support the ripe, super-concentrated fruit. Dense raspberry, cherry compote, baking spices, cola and licorice all come into play, with a streak of dried tobacco adding further interest."
Syrah,"Leather, bark and tar meet cola and black licorice scents in this full-bodied, ripe red. Its palate is layered and showy in meaty, sanguine personality."
Syrah,"A first release from this new Walla Walla winery, this is complex and textural, made using estate-grown grapes from a vineyard in the section of the valley known as The Rocks. Notes of black cherry and umami-soaked funk swirl together, with a strong streak of black tea and syrupy coffee."
Syrah,"Marred by aggressively hard tannins and acids, this Syrah's berry-cherry flavors finish thin and bitter, with a green edge. The chilly vintage took its toll. Drink up."
Syrah,"Exuberant maple and coconut aromas are forward and announce aggressive oak. In the mouth, this beefy Syrah is full but fresh, with resiny richness offset by cutting tannins and acidity. Blueberry and blackberry flavors are oaky and bring related vanilla and licorice notes in front of a lush finish."
Syrah,"Firmly in the style of the vintage, this is dense, full-bodied Cornas, with plenty of fruit. Intense plum, coffee and black olive notes dominate, while the tannins are ripe and plush. Believe it or not, this is actually drinkable now, yet should age easily through at least 2025."
Syrah,"The aromas pop, with notes of orange peel, ember, cured meat, black olive and wet stone, with purple fruit lurking in the background. The palate is surprisingly fruit forward, with plum and savory flavors that coat the palate from end to end. The finish glides for a full 30 seconds."
Syrah,"Bradley Brown's Syrah magic shines again on this wine from a vineyard planted 2,300 feet over the eastside of the Salinas Valley. The wine is redolent on the nose, with black pepper, crushed violet and salted pork. It pulls a tannic punch to the mouth once sipped, with blackberry, leather, heavy-duty tar and persistent pepper. Decant for maximum flavor extraction."
Syrah,"Voluptuous and savory, this Syrah is blended with 10% Viognier and the aromatics benefit as a result, a minerally mix of floral raspberry and vanilla. Earthy and leathery on the palate, it shows a taste of baked plum on the finish, as well as tobacco, a nice balance between Syrah's darker and brighter sides."
Syrah,"A bit less inky than some of its Syrah counterparts from more northern regions, the violet, potting soil, pepper and vanilla aromas make for a solid sipping experience. It's very soft and pleasurable to the palate, with black pepper up front and on the finish."
Syrah,"Dry enough, but the fruit has a baked, raisiny taste, suggesting that some of the grapes got by the sorting table in a shriveled condition. The finish is tannic and rich in blackberries and spices, but the wine is not an ager."
Syrah,"Sharpness compromises this wine. Whether the acidity is natural or added, it's intrusive, cutting the palate and giving a sour candy taste to the blackberries, currants and cherries. Ready now."
Syrah,"Boysenberry, violets and a touch of bacon fat show on the nose of this wine from a vineyard on Paso's Eastside. The palate is upright in both tannins and searing acidity, with flavors of tart blueberry and black peppercorn."
Syrah,"This is a shy little wine, with woodsy overtones on a base of plum and raspberry fruit. It's a bit thin in the mouth but has reasonable concentration, fine tannins and winds up with an appealing orange rind note. Drink now."
Syrah,"A unique blend of several of the winery's vineyards, this wine brings brooding notes of smoked ham, raw meat, lilac, fire pit and peat, with a thread of minerality that runs throughout. The flavors are full but deft, showing abundant smoked meat and savory notes along with a finish that seems near endless. The balance is perfectly spot-on."
Syrah,"There's a whiff of garrigue in this wine, scents and flavors of stem and herb and brambly berry. The acids are plentiful and bring notes of citrus threaded through the finish."
Syrah,"A bistro style wine to drink with grilled meats and game birds. It's juicy and crisp, with flavors of cherries, licorice and spices, wrapped into a creamy texture. Really rocks."
Syrah,"A pretty Syrah from Lazio, this fruit forward wine offers cherry, prune, spice and leather aromas. Dark plum flavors are pushed forward over the palate thanks to the wine's soft consistency."
Syrah,"Vanilla, coconut and baking-spice aromas are out in front of dark fruit. The cranberry and cherry flavors show vibrancy, with fruit and barrel flavors lingering on the long finish."
Syrah,"Soft, sweet in jammy raspberry and cherry fruit and caramelized oak, this Syrah is somewhat simple. It's good, but would benefit from greater structure."
Syrah,"Dark, big, bold and extracted, this Syrah has tough tannins that are threaded with intricate flavors of blackberry, licorice, pepper, cola and grilled bacon. The astringency will stand up to big, rich roasted and grilled meats, but it doesn't seem likely to make gains beyond the next 3–4 years."
Syrah,"Gamy roast lamb aromas meet blueberry and crushed bay leaf on the nose of this bottling—a shining example of Syrah from southern Santa Clara County. White pepper, thyme and graphite notes show on the palate, where a core of elderberry fruit core is enhanced by that feral, gamy quality."
Syrah,"Early aromas of sea water, mushroom and rubber integrate into a more pleasant whole. The flavors are sweet and candied, while on the finish a mild vegetal hint comes on. That said, the wine is decent in the mouth, where the texture is pleasant."
Syrah,"A great value wine, this fruity Syrah opens with bright blueberry, cherry and plum woven between subtle nuances of leather, spice and smoked bacon."
Syrah,This wine may not have much of Syrah's typical character but it certainly does have rich black fruits and a ripe texture. It is full and very ripe with its tannic structure well integrated into the full-bodied fruitiness. Drink now.
Syrah,"Young and vigorous now, marked by tannins and dryness that mask the fruit, making the wine somewhat aloof. However, the fruit is huge. It's ripe and succulent in blackberries and black cherries, and you'll find additional notes of smoked meat and black pepper for complexity. A wonderful Syrah that needs 3–5 years to blossom."
Syrah,"The Magnifique is a barrel selection from the French oak-aged side of the winery. It's 100% Syrah and packed with blackberry, black cherry and streaks of citrus. It's very well balanced, complete and firm; the wine should age nicely for another decade at least."
Syrah,"The structure of this Syrah, from a vineyard in the Royal Slope, is impressive. It's a balanced blend of flavors, with juicy raspberry and blackberry fruit, black olive, pepper and spice."
Syrah,"This earthy Syrah starts with mint and tobacco aromas and on the palate, spice, pepper and cigarbox flavors are restrained and elegant. Good tannic structure and balanced acids give the wine class. A touch of smoke on the finish adds to the serious nature of the wine."
Syrah,"Excellent Syrah for the price. The dry, balsam wood nose includes earthy berry fruit aromas, olive and herbs. It's herbal but ripe in the mouth, with a lively feel and driving flavors of cherry, blackberry, olive and dry herbs. Fold in some cedar, bitter chocolate, heat and tobacco and you have the total package. Drink now through 2012."
Syrah,"This wine impresses from first sip. The addition of 20% Viognier adds violet and lilac hints to the nose. Meat and lavender notes highlight its dense midpalate, packed with flavor and gravelly texture, blanketed with tannin and seasoned with white pepper and clove."
Syrah,"Lusirà is Sicilian dialect for “Syrah” grape and this hearty expression opens with inky dark concentration and intense aromas of ripe blackberry, blueberry, cinnamon, leather and smoked bacon fat. It shows a rich, chewy feel in the mouth."
Syrah,"A solid Syrah, dry and full-bodied, but not quite up to the last three vintages. Although there are savory blackberry and currant flavors, there's also a tough mintiness, and the mouthfeel is a bit scoury. Drink soon."
Syrah,"This magnum-sized bottling named after Joey Tensley's niece is a study of darkness, with asphalt, charred beef, black currant and a hint of purple flowers on the nose. It's suave and already elegant on the sip, with stewed blackberries and tart black plums, but it still needs time to grow into its sure-to-be-savory side. Drink 2019–2030."
Syrah,"This varietal Syrah from the land of Garnacha is downright superb, and for $30 it qualifies as an outstanding value. Black cherry and ripe berry aromas are big and inviting, while the palate is thick, layered and still racy due to fine acidity. Flavors of blackberry, chocolate, vanilla and baking spice run for miles on the generous finish. Drink now–2016."
Syrah,"The nose on this Ethan Lindquist-made wine from the cool-climate vineyard his parents planted shows a fabulous but not overripe cornucopia of espresso, tobacco leaf, oregano and lava rocks. The flavors are quite savory, with dried blueberries, teriyaki, beef jerky, roasted meat, lavender, rosemary and a citrus-like acidity framing the edges."
Syrah,"Richness is on full display in this bottling by Steve Martell, with baked black plum, vanilla, allspice and nearly a prune scent on the nose. Caramel flavors of blackened blackberry pie with vanilla ice cream make for a very full and undeniably delicious sip."
Syrah,"Beautiful Syrah at a fair price. It's soft and velvety, with rich, complex flavors of chocolate, blackberries, succulent anise biscotti and violets, with smoky, cedary notes from oak. Drink now."
Syrah,"Aromas of iron, olive, herb, smoke, orange peel and savory notes are followed by a ripe, full savory palate that packs a punch. It's far from shy but manages to keep it all in balance."
Syrah,"A bouquet of blackberry, black plum, anise and white chocolate sets the scene for flavors of black plum, strawberry, cocoa powder and licorice with a burst of pomegranate. This wine is soft on entry, with a nice interplay of tannins and acidity that persists into the subdued finish."
Syrah,"Made by Adelaida's winemaker Jeremy Weintraub, this bottling shows asphalt, concentrated violets and lilacs, black peppercorns and dried blueberry on the nose. Similar elements arise on the dynamically dark palate, along with black tobacco, boysenberry, leather and beef-char flavors. The structure is strong but not in the way."
Syrah,"Good price for a rich, textured Syrah. Shows delicious cherry, black raspberry, chocolate, anise, pepper and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Drink this soft, fruity Syrah now."
Syrah,"This lively, muscular, full-bodied wine ripples with smoky, meaty, peppery aromas. A thick, almost chewy texture partners with rowdy blackberry flavors and vivid tannins that will tame the rarest steak or wildest game."
Syrah,"As before, this is 100% Syrah from the Red Willow Vineyard's oldest vines. It can seem rather light when first opened, with pretty raspberry scents that carry delicate hints of herb. Complexities emerge with airing: more subtle whiffs of earth and flower and flavors that don't overwhelm, but seem to keep adding interesting threads of blueberry, black cherry, Asian spice and game."
Syrah,"Ripe in style, this offers aromas of blueberry pie and spice that lead to rich, full-bodied blue- and black-fruit flavors. There's quite a bit of warmth but the wine's appeal is hard to ignore."
Syrah,"Raymond brings their expert Cabernet touch to this Syrah. It has the rich, balanced tannins you expect from a Napa red wine, along with oodles of juicy blackberries, blueberries and cherries. But the smoked meat and black pepper notes belong to Syrah."
Syrah,"Made from 80% Syrah, 15% Grenache and 5% Riesling, this magenta-hued wine shows exuberant orange blossom and cherry flavors buoyed by moderate acidity and seaspray-like freshness. It finishes rich and fruity, bringing a creamsicle in summer to mind."
Syrah,"This is a new project from Christophe Baron. The aromas pop, with notes of earth, plum, nori, iron, sea salt, herb, olive tapenade, black pepper and smoked meat. The palate is concentrated and structured, with rich yet restrained bacon fat and smoke flavors that bring a sense of vibrancy and richness along with a near endless finish. It brings a fair amount of tannic heft that will benefit from some additional time in the bottle. Best from 2024-2028."
Syrah,"This is a unicorn wine that only gets made in exceptional years—the last time was a decade ago. Hailing from Morrison Lane, the oldest Syrah plantings in the valley, it brings mesmerizing aromas of blackberry, black fruit, moist earth and wet stone. The black-fruit flavors consume the palate, showing density, depth and exceptional length. It's a complete heart-stopper."
Syrah,Unusual aromas of cocoa and green tea mochi lead to a creamy smooth palate. The oak plays a primary role.
Syrah,"Ripe, luscious black cherries and berries are framed by whispers of bramble and tannin in this enticingly fruity, forward Syrah. A showcase of fresh, primary fruit, it's juicy and delightfully gulp-worthy. Drink now through 2017."
Syrah,"Only a cave cooperative could deliver Hermitage at this price. Even better, the wine is excellent and admirably reflects its terroir. Cracked pepper, leather and mocha aromas lead into flavors of coffee, black olive and peppery spice. It's medium to full in body and slightly creamy in texture, with a long, silky finish that reflects bottle age. Drink now–2025."
Syrah,"This winery's Walla Walla Valley debut displays aromas of ash, green olive, grilled asparagus, dried flowers, smoked meat and blue fruit. The smoke and savory flavors are soft and reserved in style, showing a pleasing persistence on the finish."
Syrah,"Very ripe and extracted, just oozing the flavors of melted blackberry jam, black raspberry purée and milk chocolate. A bit sweet, but saved by firm tannins."
Syrah,"This extremely flavorful but young and tightly wound wine has black pepper, dark chocolate and smoke aromas, concentrated blackberry and cassis flavors, firm tannins and full body. This is a powerful, full-bodied, firmly structured wine that needs time to show its best side. It should drink beautifully after 2018."
Syrah,"Shows its warm California origins in the milk chocolate-infused blackberry and blueberry pie filling and plumped raisin flavors. Delicious, but too soft, sugary sweet and hot."
Syrah,"Very soft and simple, with candied flavors of blackberries, cocoa, spices and oak. Perfectly fine for drinking now."
Syrah,"Grapes are sourced from Red Mountain and old-vine Yakima valley sites. Lovely aromatics highlight a mix of citrus, wild blueberry, brambly red fruits and a whiff of game. The structure and breadth lead into a smooth finish with veins of licorice and espresso."
Syrah,"Previously this Syrah was sourced completely from Lawrence vineyard grapes, but here they are mixed with fruit from Stonetree. It's a dark, smoky wine, with highlights of licorice around deep cassis fruit flavors. The chewy tannins finish with a pleasant streak of lovely cherry fruit."
Syrah,"This elegant wine smells subtly like blackberries, lilac and plum skin. It tastes very firm with tannins and acidity, well balanced and medium to full bodied. Built to age, the rather subdued but complex fruit and spice flavors will come out more fully with time, and will be best after 2018."
Syrah,"Aromas of black-skinned fruit, espresso, dried herbs and toasted oak lead the nose. The one-dimensional palate offers dried black cherry, coffee and ground pepper while firm, fine-grained tannins give it a polished feel."
Syrah,"Coming from a single vineyard block and aged in neutral oak, this wine delivers varietal and site specificity. The dark-fruit flavors are layered and come in waves, showing great intensity along with exceptional balance, with a finish that lingers. It's an impressive inaugural release."
Syrah,"A fairly standard Syrah, softly sweet and direct in berry, mocha, spice and oak flavors. Tons of fruit, but lacks complexity for the price."
Syrah,"Soy, black fruit and asphalt aromas are strong on the nose of this wine by the Four Sisters project. The palate is varietally pure, with black pepper, tar and boysenberry. It dives a bit deeper as well, showing coffee and dark chocolate character."
Syrah,"Light in style, this is a pleasant, varietally correct wine with notes of violets, game and lemon playing off a soft, rounded mouthfeel and grainy tannins."
Syrah,"This cool-vintage wine offers aromas of vanilla, coconut, barrel spice, clove and red fruit. The palate is full of restrained cranberry flavors that show persistence."
Syrah,"For those who want a little funk in their Syrah, this conjures up flavors reminiscent of wines from the Rocks District in Walla Walla. Credit the rocky soil of this Similkameen Valley vineyard, which delivers dense, well-knit flavors of red and purple fruits, smoke, tanned leather, tobacco and licorice. Concentrated flavors of raspberry purée hold down the core."
Syrah,"Black pepper dominates the aroma of this wine, along with black currants, grilled meat and something sweetly spicy and exotic, like a teriyaki dressing. In the mouth, it turns softly sweet and candied. Drink now."
Syrah,"This wine is mostly Syrah, which gives juicy blackberry, plum and chocolate-covered raisin flavors. The slight percent of Viognier brings acidity and an uplifted floral note to this easy-drinking wine."
Syrah,"High-toned energy is the persistent theme of this coastal Syrah. The nose is jumpy and wild, with leather, coffee and tarry notes along with foxy berry fruit. A juicy, crisp palate is high in acid, ringing with peppery currant and plum flavors. Toasty, spicy oak leads a ripped, bold finish. Drink through 2023."
Syrah,"There's a unique, slightly oxidative quality to the nose of this bottling, with balsamic reduction, savory pepper and cola on the nose. Tart berries are surrounded by sea salt and crushed peppercorns on the palate, which is framed by squeaky tannins and persistent acidity."
Syrah,"Asphalt, sour berries and purple flowers show on the nose of this brawny wine by winery owner, Tara Gomez, a descendent of the Chumash tribe. The rigid tannic structure on the palate allows only thicker espresso bean and more tar flavors to emerge."
Syrah,"Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year. Generously slathered in toasty new oak, this very limited (two barrel) reserve from the estate's Frank's Vineyard is not the blockbuster of the previous vintage, but shows exceptional winemaking skills. Black cherry fruit is wrapped in woody tannins, a yin-yang combination that works by dissonance rather than harmony."
Syrah,"Nutty, meaty and complex, this crisp, high-toned wine offers food-friendly elegance and refreshment while teasing in savory hints of earthiness. Balanced and dry, it continues to impress as it glides along in the glass."
Syrah,"All of Viu Manent's single-vineyard wines have the right stuff. This one starts out staunch and concentrated before it unfolds with inky, black-fruit aromas, warm earth and saturated blackberry and spice flavors. Ripe, rich and meaty. A prime New World Syrah with teeth and character. Drink now through 2012."
Syrah,"Very dry and rather sharp in acidity, this Syrah offers cherry-berry flavors with a hint of herbs and spices. It turns bitter on the finish. Good price, but could use greater richness."
Syrah,"Tar and beef char kick off the nose on this dark and heavy wine, which offers asphalt, smoked meats and crushed elderberry. Caramelized beef, balsamic-blackberry reduction, tobacco and touches of smoke show on the palate."
Syrah,"Aromas of dark fruit and cedar lead the nose and follow through to the warm, soft palate with peppercorn, licorice and dried blackcurrant. Velvety tannins provide the framework but it's shy on freshness, so enjoy soon."
Syrah,"There's an herbal streak to the berry center of this wine, with just the faintest suggestion of mocha that unfolds on the finish. The texture is full and slightly creamy, with dusty tannins providing enough structure and balance."
Syrah,"Tasty but ultimately simple, with raspberry and cherry jam, orange rind and plenty of sweet, toasty oak flavors. Drink up."
Syrah,"This dilute red wine could be anything. It's green, tannic, and generic."
Syrah,"A blend of Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills vineyard fruit cofermented with Viognier, this wine opens with aromas of mountain blueberries, wild flowers, orange peel and pomegranate. The flavors are perfumed and polished, with floral and blue-fruit notes lingering on the finish. It brings a lovely sense of texture."
Syrah,"Plump and meaty, this opens with dark aromas of blackberry, spice, crushed pepper and bresaola. This would drink well at informal occasions with family and friends."
Syrah,"Aromas of graphite, black fruit and herb mark this powerful, forward, extracted Syrah. The palate drills away with tannins and fruit, while the flavors run toward blackberry, herb and earthy spice. Dark and dense on the finish, with licorice and pepper flavors, this is ready to drink now–2014."
Syrah,"It's a good thing Garagiste Festival cofounder Stewart McLennan caught the winemaking bug. This delicious bottling shows black currant, plum, blueberry, fennel, lavender, vanilla and gingerbread spice on the nose. Elegant purple-flower elements kick off the palate, and then come waves of blueberry-chiffon cake, blackberry juice, sea-salt caramel and a touch of vanilla."
Syrah,"Scents of black cherry, tar and coffee-crusted beef roast show on the nose of this hefty bottling. The cherry extends to the palate, where it picks up the tang of just-ripe boysenberry and pure flavors of black pepper and asphalt, as well as a cigar ash complexity toward the finish."
Syrah,"A tremendous Syrah, the way Pride makes all their red wines. The mashed ripe cherries, cherry liqueur and mocha flavors immediately explode, leading to a deep, long-lasting and spicy finish. With intense mountain concentration and a smattering of sweet, smoky oak, it's best enjoyed soon for its sheer, heady power."
Syrah,"Ripe black cherry fruit is underlain by hints of game in this medium-bodied Crozes from one of the world's biggest producers of Syrah. It's a clean, crisp wine with a faintly dusty texture to its finish. Drink now–2018."
Syrah,"Aromas of café au lait, woodspice and dark fruit lead to full-bodied, hedonistic coffee flavors. The style is rich, mixing fruit and barrel."
Syrah,"Licorice, blackberry extract and a slate-driven mineral element power the complex nose. There's great tension between hearty, ripe olallieberry fruit and bitter plum skins on the palate, resulting in one of the winery's best 2011s."
Syrah,"The aromas are quite locked up at present, with notes of cranberry, cherry, herb and wood spice. On the palate, the dark-fruit flavors show the warmth of the vintage, with a spine of firm tannins providing support."
Syrah,"Almost black in color, this is a Syrah to rival the most concentrated wines from the Rhône. It has weight, richness and power, its dark damson fruit flavors and tannins almost lost in all this intense fruit. Age for 3–4 years or drink now."
Syrah,"Blackberry, tobacco, dried purple flowers and bloody meats greet the nose on this solid wine from pioneering winegrower Louis Lucas and his retired judge partner, Royce Lewellen. The palate shows black cherries and plums, with complexity added by tobacco and pepper spice. The flavors come in and go out quickly, proving clean and fresh."
Syrah,"Snoqualmie can legitimately lay claim to being Washington's most consistent and reliable producer of mass market, value-priced wines. This tart and racy Syrah is a fine example of the quality—no frills, but no fudging either. It tastes like fruit—blueberries and boysenberries, with some leafy, herbal tannins. In perfect balance, it's a fine every day wine with more flavor interest than most ten buck merlots and cabs."
Syrah,"Just two barrels of this Paul Hobbs-consulted wine were made, and that focus is evidenced by its soft and lavish vanilla, mace, cocoa, white pepper and lavender aromas and its core of cassis fruit. Luxurious tannins and underlying acidity carry measured blackberry and chocolate flavors."
Syrah,"Brooding dark fruit and stemmy herb and olive aromas lead to rich, extracted black fruit flavors with a warm, coffee filled finish. It delivers a powerful punch."
Syrah,"Made in a ready-to-drink, approachable style, this would be a fine introduction to Hawke's Bay/Gimblett Gravels Syrah. Blueberries, mulberries and spices abound, while hints of espresso and dark chocolate appear on the softly dusty finish. Drink this medium-bodied wine now through 2020."
Syrah,"Vibrantly intoxicating wafts of varietal pepper and violets are complemented by gorgeous layers of blackberry, raspberry and smoky, gamy meat. The acidity marks the palate most, however, lifting the wine's denseness of concentration into a more complex and interesting place. Made in small quantities, this wine is ready to enjoy but will age through 2021, as well."
Syrah,"Combined with 20% Grenache, this full-bodied, fruit-forward wine brings sweet aromas and flavors of raspberry jam and plum. Aged in mostly neutral oak, it possesses purity that carries through the finish."
Syrah,"A fruity wine, with tangy cranberry and raspberry flavors. Sharply acidic, with fairly strong tannins, it seems a little tight and thin, but does have the pure fruit and some length in the finish to recommend it."
Syrah,"Baking spice, vanilla and dark-fruit aromas are followed by dark cherry and coffee flavors that linger on the finish. The barrel influence seems a little intense."
Syrah,"This wine shows ripeness, depth and purity. In the mouth, it is saturated and thick. Flavors of saffron, tomato paste, oregano and stewed berry fruits are pure Kankana. A different breed of Syrah, it reflects San Pedro's pioneering efforts in the Elqui Valley."
Syrah,"Dark as night, with forceful aromas of root beer, menthol, warm earth and baked fruits. Maybe it's a bit soft and widespread given the heat of 2003, but if flesh and fruit turn you on and the lack of complexity isn't too disconcerting, it's a fine modern Syrah. Good with bacon burgers, steak off the grill, etc."
Syrah,"At more than four years of age, this Syrah is very dry. It's also tannic, with a hard, astringent bite to the blackberries. Somewhat rustic, it seems unlikely to develop in the bottle."
Syrah,"Meat, compost and leather notes mark the entry of this Syrah blended with smaller amounts of Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah. Light black pepper and red fruit flavors are sustained by a soft, round texture and lingering finish."
Syrah,"Aromas of cooking spice, game and mature black fruit waft out of the glass. The spicy, easy-drinking palate offers dried blackberry, peppercorn and clove alongside velvety tannins."
Syrah,"There's a very likable quality to this Syrah that is made in Puglia by a Tuscan producer. It comes off as forest berry, Asian spice and dried raspberry. The wine has a light consistency and some green, almost bramble-like flavors that are peppered by spicy accents."
Syrah,"Classic overtones of olive and black pepper lend character to pulpy, ripe black cherry flavor in this bold, full-bodied Syrah. It's rich and yielding on the palate with just a faint fringe of tannins. It finishes on a slightly medicinal note."
Syrah,"This Perli is a gem, a gorgeous reminder that California Syrah can be a liquified representation of beauty. Carrying violet overtones, the wine offers just-picked raspberry and a pronounced entry of peppery spice. Soft it has a long finish and complex subtleties approaching magic. Sit this wine in your cellar if you dare—it's so good to drink now."
Syrah,"A meaty, gamy Syrah boasting aromas of bacon and duck-liver mousse, this wine delivers tremendous flavor and quality for the price. It offers plenty of body around a core of plush, savory tannins and a long finish of pepper and cinnamon spice. Start slicing the charcuterie."
Syrah,"Quite vibrant and floral on the nose, this shows deep blackberry and both dried and fresh purple-flower elements as well as a baked berry pastry. The flavors are well integrated on the palate, where cooked blackberries in a vanilla pie crust combine with juicy strawberry, peppercorns and rosemary spice."
Syrah,"The winemaker has said he makes Russian River Valley Pinot Noir to support his Syrah habit. Here he offers a compelling case in point, making a velvety, substantial 100% Syrah that's more elegant than overpowering. Mocha-kissed tannins play nicely with black and red berry fruit, providing a structure built to age, through 2021."
Syrah,"A beautiful Syrah, dry, full-bodied and tannic, that shows lots of class and elegance at this price. It has rich, complex flavors of blackberries, black cherries, red currants and oak, with earthy, leathery, bacon and licorice notes. Needs a few years to come around due to the tannins, or give it a good decant."
Syrah,"An aromatically interesting wine with notes of cherry, cedar and nori. The palate is flavorful with dry, rustic tannins."
Syrah,"A bright, vivacious, juicy and fruit-driven style, loaded with boysenberries. Tart and racy, this has just a hint of a gamy undertone. The finish has smooth, silky tannins, and plenty of staying power."
Syrah,"Lots of cool-climate Syrah character in this wine. It's dry and full-bodied, with blackberry, plum, bacon and black pepper aromas and flavors. Too light for aging, so drink now."
Syrah,"A tight beam of oak and char runs through prune, blackberry and cassis aromas. This Somontano Syrah feels tight like a fist, with rough tannins and bright acidity. Peppery oak and black-fruit flavors are lightly herbal and spicy on a snappy finish that doesn't lay down. Drink through 2019."
Syrah,"This Syrah hails from northern Chile, and it deals aromas of sweet black fruit, olive, rubber and oak. It feels juicy and fruity, with racy black plum, wild berry and pepper flavors. It's rather raw in feel and modest in complexity, but overall it's interesting."
Syrah,"This is a gorgeous wine that's driven by notes of spice and new wood. The wood is supported by ripe flavors of plum, damson and blackberry juice, with tight acidity. The Alentejo's dry climate is certainly suited to Syrah, producing fine structure. Age for 3–4 years."
Syrah,"Part of a Limited Release series, this Syrah is made from fruit that was sourced from the Wahluke Slope, and it's co-fermented with 5% Viognier. Solid and substantial, it offers clear flavors of coffee, licorice, herb and earth, plus a deep, saturated note of blackberry syrup. A touch of dark chocolate infuses the finish."
Syrah,"Alluring and intense aromas of soot, campfire, charcuterie, black pepper, herb, crushed flowers and liquid stone lead to a broadly rich, intense, flavorful palate, absolutely loaded with fruit and savory flavors that glide on the extended finish."
Syrah,"Black gravel and cracked pepper spice enliven a nose reminiscent of a dried boysenberry Fruit Roll-Up on this wine by 25-year-old winemaker-to-watch Bret Urness. It's bursting with mouthwatering acidity on the palate, almost in an overpowering way, showing purple fruit and black spice flavors."
Syrah,"This is a full-bodied, sturdy wine, bursting with blueberries and baking spices. Licorice adds interest, as do some savory notes of meat, olive and espresso. Drink 2016–2023."
Syrah,"The Peju style is of soft, ripe voluptuousness, making this the kind of wine that's enormously attractive to drink now. This '11 Syrah is immediately appealing for its raspberry, cherry and oak flavors, but it's the mouthfeel that's special. With modest alcohol, it feels smooth, silky and clean. Drink now."
Syrah,"Aromas of earth, black cherry, cedar and blackberry precede full-bodied, layered fruit flavors with a long finish. It's a delicious, no-holds-barred offering of the variety."
Syrah,"Grill a nice steak and wash it down with this richly textured, gentle Syrah. Dry and smoky, it has black pepper-infused flavors of blackberries, currants and singed bacon. Gives lots of elegant pleasure for the price."
Syrah,"Dense aromas of caramel-laced fudge and hickory-smoked meats atop the base of blackberry coulis show on this lavish, delicious bottling. Framed in a chalky structure, the smoked-meat element consumes the palate, which also shows black cherry, vanilla ice cream, caramel and rich milk-chocolate flavorings."
Syrah,"Still tight and young, this tastes like a keeper that will improve with time. Aged in all new American barrels, it shows aromas of coriander, cumin and smoke, with flavors like black cherry and black pepper. It balances well between firm tannins, good acidity and full flavors, and everything sails through the finish. Best after 2018."
Syrah,"Rich, succulent and exotic, this Syrah captures the appealing spice and leather notes that are capable of accenting any good red wine. Alongside there's immense black fruit flavors and an underbelly of oaky coffee and mocha. A  touch narrow and short on the finish."
Syrah,"This is a huge bear-hug of a wine, from the effusive dark-fruit aromas through the rich, layered texture and ripe fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It is full bodied, well oaked, spicy and complex, with a mouthcoating texture and long finish."
Syrah,"This is a dark and muscular expression of Syrah executed in a quasi-Australian style, with loads of concentration and spice, backed by smoked bacon, Teriyaki, candied berry and Indian spice."
Syrah,"The aromas bring notes of herbs, green olive, flowers and blue and black fruit. The blue fruit flavors are ripe and full bodied, with spice flavors lingering on the finish."
Syrah,Aromas of dark fruit and wood spice lead to cranberry and cherry flavors. It shows a sense of poise.
Syrah,"Pure varietal, this is a relatively light take on Syrah, but balanced and showing some nice details of tobacco and licorice. The fruit is tart—a mix of rhubarb and tangy red berry—and there's ample acidity for those who like their reds to snap into focus."
Syrah,"Black and white pepper pop from the glass in this cool-climate, cool-vintage wine that retains just enough power around lacy acidity. A bouquet of violets rises on the nose before the palate offers spicy, lean bursts of meat, leather and black licorice. Made in small amounts, this wine is well worth seeking."
Syrah,"The least expensive Saint-Joseph from LVV is this attractively tarry, smoky offering. It offers exciting complexity, marrying herbal, savory notes of black olive, smoke and wood ash with just enough blackberry and raspberry fruit while remaining medium bodied and almost delicate on the palate. Drink now–2018."
Syrah,"Dark and fragrant, this interesting Syrah opens quickly with blue and black berries, a streak of balsamic, and suggestions of bloody meat. Off to a great start, it thins out through the finish, while remaining interesting with surprising complexity."
Syrah,"Driven by vivid blackberry and black cherry flavors, this medium-bodied wine tastes pure, concentrated, and true to the grape variety. It has mild tannins, fresh acidity and an appealing sense of balance."
Syrah,"An intensely fruit-driven Syrah marked by jammy blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, pepper and melted milk chocolate. Delicious and unidimensional."
Syrah,"This starts with concentrated boysenberry and raspberry fruit, but in the mouth some off-flavors intrude. The fruit is close to raisined, and the finish carries a hint of plastic. Two bottles tasted, consistent results."
Syrah,"The aromas in this wine pop, with notes of dried herb, plum, vanilla and smoked meat. It brings a compelling sense of texture, coating the palate from end to end with exquisitely balanced fruit and savory flavors. It's a knockout at this price."
Syrah,"With the fruit coming from Pepper Bridge, Seven Hills and Yellow Jacket vineyards, this winery's inaugural Walla Walla Valley release displays complex aromas of coffee, smoked meat, mineral, blueberries, violets and licorice. The dark coffee flavors are concentrated and dense, coming in waves and leading to an extended finish."
Syrah,"Overtly sweet, like sugared blackberry tea with a squeeze of cassis and a bite of milk chocolate. Good flavors, but should be drier and firmer in structure as a table wine."
Syrah,The wine is structured and tannic which gives a dry edge that balances the perfumed black fruits and acidity. The aftertaste is fruity and juicy. Ready to drink.
Syrah,"Savory berry and tomato aromas come with mild notes of mint and green. This is racy on the palate, with bold acidity. Toasty, savory berry flavors come with chocolaty overtones, while this settles on the palate but remains juicy and high in acidity."
Syrah,"This Rhône-inspired red from a great site takes a lovely, light-hearted approach to the variety, capturing its ability to conjure black olive tapenade and savory, leathery texture while keeping the ripeness of the fruit more elusive. Already given a respectable amount of time in bottle, it's enjoyable now and for years to come."
Syrah,"Thick and syrupy, this Syrah is not for everyone, but it will certainly stand apart from the crowd. Flavors of black cherry compote and maple syrup soak into the earthy, tannic base, with just a hint of volatility."
Syrah,"A great effort, with mountain-grown fruit, high-altitude acids that give the flavors shape and cut, tightening up and brightening up the sharp, wild berry fruit. Iron filings and stone add a strong mineral element as well; this is the best yet from Dumas Station."
Syrah,"Already six years old, this is in full bloom, offering aromas of jammy red and black fruit sprinkled with cocoa and iron. Flavors show purity and richness, with barrel influences dialed back."
Syrah,"Syrah is the best of the Script & Seal offerings, showing sharp-toned flavors of cassis, licorice, tobacco and ultra-dark chocolate."
Syrah,"This Syrah's outstanding feature isn't the ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, cocoa and smoked meat flavors, although they are delicious. It's the balance. The tannins are lovely, the acidity is just right and the finish is spicy and complex. The wine frames the Syrah argument in California in a new way."
Syrah,The Lucas 2007 Limited Reserve Syrah shows the potential the Syrah grape has in upstate New York. Dense raspberry and strawberry fruit vie with aromas of barbecued meat on the nose while a thick layer of vanilla cushions the fine tannins and smokey notes in the mouth. The juicy finish throws up an enticing licorice note. Nicely done. Drink now to 2011.
Syrah,"This wine's crushed herb, mineral and blackberry aromas lead to intensely rich, full-bodied black fruit and smoked meat flavors. It's big and bold and ready for steak."
Syrah,"This study of a low-yielding clone produced a compelling range of aromas and flavors. The nose leads with iodine, seaweed and coffee scents against a backdrop of tangy black fruit. The palate shows more nori, lavender, black pepper, asphalt and dried blackberry flavor, finishing on a lingering oaky note."
Syrah,"Vibrant lavender, as well as the flowering tips of rosemary and thyme, meet with blueberry on the floral nose of this wine that shows little of the tarry harshness that often comes from the grape. Lavender also marks the sip, as does white pepper, crushed thyme, dried mint, sage and even tarragon, atop a dark purple-fruit backbone."
Syrah,"This is dry and velvety in texture, with rich, complex flavors of cherries, licorice, bacon, Dr. Pepper and savory, peppery spices. A touch of oak adds a sweet smokiness. Almost as light as a Pinot Noir, it's a very pretty, polished Syrah to drink now."
Syrah,"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones. It's aromatically expressive with black olive, crushed flowers, mineral, black pepper and an earthy funk. Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish."
Syrah,"Force Majeure and Ciel du Cheval are the sources for this pure, compelling Red Mountain Syrah. The complex aromatics shoot up a smorgasbord of cured meat, truffle and umami notes, leading into a crisp, racy palate with lovely blueberry-dominated fruit flavors. Aging in 500-liter puncheons smoothes it out while contributing just a hint of new toast."
Syrah,"Winemaker: Marc Kent. A blend of Syrah from Kent's Porseleinberg's Vineyard and an old Stellenbosch vineyard, this is a gripping and young Syrah, begging for some time to mature. Initially, aromas of church incense, fruit cake, licorice and fynbos lead the bouquet, with ripe black cherry and berry fruit at the core. It's rich and robust, with aggressive tannins that lend a gripping texture to the mouthfeel and a bittersweet cocoa astringency to the finish, alongside notes of char and black olive. Drink 2021–2026."
Syrah,"Smells and tastes not quite ripe. Now that the wine is softening and resolving at the age of 3-1/2 years, it's showing a streak of veggie green behind the cherries."
Syrah,"Earthy tobacco, smoke and spice on the nose and a fruit-forward palate make this expressive Shiraz an attractive cohort to smoked meat dishes and cheese assortments. The wine has a backbone of toasted oak and a smooth character."
Syrah,"Dusty aromas of tea and dried spices blend well with black olive and black-fruit notes. This wine has a lean but muscular build. Plum and wild berry flavors come with dry, spicy oak accents. Acidity keeps the finish in shape and ensures length; drink through 2022."
Syrah,"The aromas pop, with notes of stargazer lilies, brown stems, green olive and smoked meat, revealing more on each swirl. The fruit and savory flavors are rich and layered, earthshaking in their intensity, with a lengthy finish that only heightens the interest. It's a complete showstopper."
Syrah,"This is a sweet, fruity, soft Syrah. With raspberry, cherry, mocha and cinnamon spice flavors, it tastes like a liquid granola health bar."
Syrah,"From a south-facing hillside site on the edge of the Petaluma Gap at Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard, this fruity and complex wine shows white pepper and earthy notes, taking time to open in the glass. Varietal in its pepper, leather and violet aromas, it's sleek and tart—a cool-climate rendition of the grape."
Syrah,"This Syrah starts off earthy, musky, big and brawny and can't escape the wood-oaked herbal greenness on the finish. It's simply too high in alcohol."
Syrah,"Density is a hallmark of all the Silverback reds, and this is the biggest of them all. It's packed tight and almost impenetrable until it's had several hours of breathing time. A mouthful of black fruits is set amidst a sea of darker flavors: tar, smoke, charcoal, graphite, cacao, licorice and espresso grounds. Put this one aside for up to a decade."
Syrah,"Thick, heavy, potent and mouth-coating, this is a liquorous, almost syrupy wine, sure to please those who like big fruit, big tannins, and big barrel flavors. Chocolate, espresso, tar and bourbon barrel flavors dominate, in keeping with the house style."
Syrah,"Seemingly sweet and mellow, this tastes like white toast that has been spread with raspberry jam and butter, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar. It's already drinking well."
Syrah,"This wine, which includes 17% Mourvèdre and 8% Grenache, is a blend of fruit from Arianses, Stone Tree, Ciel du Cheval and Heart of the Hill vineyards. Baking spice, vanilla, dark fruit and cocoa aromas lead to ripe, generous black fruit flavors. It's a bold, hedonistic interpretation of the variety, with oak playing a prominent role."
Syrah,"Strong aromas of blackberry extract, cedar, nose-tickling herbs and a bit of bacon fat mark the nose of this release from a winery whose 84-year-old namesake died in October 2014. The flavors balance tartness with ripe berries, roasted fennel, emergent tannins and purple flowers that linger into the finish."
Syrah,"Smooth and engaging, this offers classic varietal flavors in the context of a northern climate. Red licorice, coffee, tobacco, hemp and dried herbs are all in the mix, with some fruit leather and hints of violets."
Syrah,"Sharply defined aromas, with a little funk at the base, lead into tart red fruits and flavors of slightly bitter herbs. The fruit fades quickly, leaving tart flavors of stem and leaf in its wake."
Syrah,"A terrific effort, this is a full-bodied, almost Port-like expression of Cornas. Asphalt, espresso and tapenade notes make for an intriguing bouquet, then pick up plum and earth on the palate. The finish is long, velvety and packed with drying tannins, so give it until at least 2018, then drink through 2025 or so."
Syrah,"Wood spice, cherry and herb aromas are followed by luscious cherry flavors. It keeps you coming back for more with a high yum factor."
Syrah,"This terrific wine is classically varietal, with beautifully defined flavors of cured meats, tobacco, coffee, lavender and peppercorn, all in service to ripe purple fruits. Impeccably balanced, it conveys finesse."
Syrah,"This Rocks District offering has aromas of black pepper and stems, seeming a bit locked up at the moment. Flavors are palate-staining with smoked meat and assorted herbs along with a lightly tacky feel."
Syrah,"The aromas offer notes of cherry, baking and barrel spices and are topped off with partially amped-up volatiles. The flavors are lush and full bodied, lingering on the finish."
Syrah,"An opening of spicy, borderline green and minty aromas announce a wine from a cool vintage. Freshness on the palate provides a racy quality, but more depth would be nice. Flavors of wild berry and oak finish sweet, with a slight sticky quality."
Syrah,"A bit tough in acidity, which seems to accentuate the ripe fruit, giving it a jammy, tart quality. The flavors are of blackberries, cherries, tangerines and sandalwood. Drink now."
Syrah,"Concentrated and rich with strong kirsch and raspberry jam flavors that fill the medium-weight mouth. A touch of spice appears on the close, but otherwise this is a straightforward and easygoing quaff."
Syrah,"This wine is überaromatic, with notes of raspberry jam, stemmy herbs, blackberries, smoked meat, orange peel, iron and an earthy funk. The palate brings a lot of intensity of flavor, with smoke and orange-peel notes lingering on the warm finish."
Syrah,"This wine is made from a field blend that includes 2% Viognier, the vines planted in 1991. Co-fermented, it offers a soft texture accented in vanilla bean, leather and dusty blackberry. Intense, it's balanced and not overripe, a nice take on the variety that flirts with tastes of orange and white pepper."
Syrah,"Lots of rich blueberry, cherry and blackberry fruit flavors in this Syrah. It's soft in the mouth, with a sweetness that's due to caramelized oak and the glycerine of high alcohol. Not an ager, but delicious now with charred beef."
Syrah,"Raymond brings their expert Cabernet touch to this Syrah. It has the rich, balanced tannins you expect from a Napa red wine, along with oodles of juicy blackberries, blueberries and cherries. But the smoked meat and black pepper notes belong to Syrah."
Syrah,"Sweet aromas of black raisin and licorice are a good indicator of what's to come. This is one thick, jammy, softer-bodied wine that's ready to drink now. Flavors of saturated blackberry, mocha and black pepper are attractive, and the finish ends with molasses sweetness and espresso bitterness."
Syrah,"A fine value in Northern Rhône Syrah, the Tain cooperative's 2009 Crozes-Hermitage is fairly extracted for a Crozes, with plummy, dark fruit alongside hints of clove, leather and coffee. Turns a bit astringent on the finish; try 2013–2018."
Syrah,"Perbruno is a beautiful Syrah from central Tuscany that showcases loads of elegant spice and cinnamon backed by blueberry, cherry and sophisticated oak renderings. Pair this wine with succulent steak and green pepper cream sauce."
Syrah,"Composed, cool aromas of marzipan, vanilla, boysenberry and cassis are touched up by controlled oak. This feels cushioned but with pop and tannic grab. Dark peppery herbal black-fruit flavors come with a chocolaty component, while this tastes of herbs and chocolate cake on a bold oaky finish. Drink through 2022."
Syrah,"The aromas provide notes of baking spice, vanilla, licorice and dark fruit that are starting to show some bottle age. Full-bodied dried red-fruit and cranberry flavors lead to a tart finish."
Syrah,"From the Solano County Green Valley appellation just off San Pablo Bay comes this crowd-pleasing Syrah, a juicy, masculinely beefy and big version of the varietal with well-honed hints of baked bread, mocha and espresso."
Syrah,"Can't-miss aromas of juniper, olive and tree bark dominate lesser notes of lemon peel and blackberry. This feels taut and rubbery, with tomatoey acidity. Woodsy, herbal, gritty flavors of currant and cranberry finish tart and with a note of minty green."
Syrah,"If you haven't puzzled it out from the name, this is a Syrah-based cuvée. Aged 14 months in second-use oak, it features dark, smoky notes on the nose to balance the bright raspberry aromas, then turns darker and meatier on the palate, ending with a hint of coffee. The tannins are supple and impart a rich texture. Drink now–2017."
Syrah,"The pretty but powerful nose is like striking a gusher of black gold in a field of lavender, full of tar, violet and blueberry. Leather and deep purple fruit lead the palate, with charred meat savoriness, black pepper spice and plum skin tannins making a good case for this seven-acre vineyard that was planted in 1998."
Syrah,"Angular plum and berry aromas are rubbery. This Syrah feels wide and blocky, but solid. Black-fruit flavors finish with drawing tannins and a shot of black coffee."
Syrah,"Ultraripe black fruits—berries and cherries, along with raisins—reflect the high alcohol. Even so, the wine carries an impression of almost sugary sweetness, as if still not fermented completely dry. Spice cake and plum pudding, with heat on the finish, mark this as extreme by previous Fielding Hills standards. Drink soon."
Syrah,"The black, inky color of this Syrah only begins to suggest its power. The first sip explodes with flavors of melted dark chocolate and crème de cassis, sprinkled with black pepper. It's a huge wine, not particularly subtle and almost port-like in its rich, raisiny finish."
Syrah,"Let this Syrah open, but once it does, it is full of raspberry, black pepper, oak and gamy goodness, medium-bodied, elegant and nicely in balance."
Syrah,"This wine shows bacon fat, boysenberry and tarragon on the nose. It's full and ripe on the palate, bringing similar flavors, also showing blackberry, roasted pork and black pepper. It proves quite delicious and just what one expects from a warmer-climate Syrah."
Syrah,"A pure expression of Syrah from coastal Tuscany, Pieve dei Monaci offers a chewy texture and thick layers of black fruit, prune, cola, spice and smoked bacon. Pair this wine with grilled meat."
Syrah,"This wine boasts an attractive nose of garrigue and mixed berries, but falls off a bit on the palate, where it comes across as a bit thin in texture. The cherry-berry flavors are pleasant, but the wine appears to lack concentration and richness. Tasted a second time, I found it slightly better (86 points), but still have concerns about the lack of texture on the midpalate."
Syrah,"Disappointing, especially from this winery and vineyard, at this price. It's high in acidity and tough in tannins, and oak just adds a caramelized sweetness to the jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. This Syrah isn't going anywhere, so drink up."
Syrah,"Marked by extreme dryness and tannic astringency, this 100% Syrah might benefit from time in the cellar, although there can be no guarantees with an unknown producer. It has a good core of black currants, black pepper and baker's chocolate. Try after 2009."
Syrah,"A little funky and jumpy at first, but it settles down. Rapsberry, pepper and a hint of green herb give it a snappy outlook, and while it's mostly solid, it may be a tiny bit stretched compared to others. In between the folds, there's mocha, pepper and a reedy bite. Nice wine with a couple of minor flaws."
Syrah,"There's no denying this wine's appeal with its aromas and flavors of dark fruit, café au lait, earth and herbs. It's restrained yet flavorful, with a lingering, coffee-filled finish."
Syrah,"Meaty and dense, this full-bodied red is expansive on the palate in well-defined layers of leather, blueberry and black pepper flavor."
Syrah,"Alluring aromas of blackberry and barrel spice lead to ripe, full-bodied black-fruit flavors, showing beautiful depth and a long finish. It packs a hefty punch while never losing its sense of balance."
Syrah,"Charred beef, blackberries, elderberries and sweet tar aromas show on this small-batch wine made by a couple from Texas. There's decent density on the palate, with lots of blackberry fruit and black pepper as well as extremely bright acidity that will keep this wine alive for years."
Syrah,"Awesomely rich and forward with cherry and raspberry jam, chocolate and spice flavors, this high-alcohol wine fortunately is balanced with adequate acidity, firm tannins and even a hit of minerals. But the overall impression is of soft fruitiness. It's mainly Syrah, with small quantities of Grenache and Mourvèdre."
Syrah,"This 100% Syrah from sunny coastal Tuscany offers extreme softness and richness with chocolate, cherry liqueur, blueberry and smoked bacon fat. Pair this rich wine with game meat or stew."
Syrah,"This is a rich wine showing jammy blackberry flavors against pronounced alcohol. The acidity at the end does provide a lighter, fresher lift."
Syrah,"This is the least expensive McCrea Syrah, compiled from the same excellent sources as the higher end wines. It's a solid effort, with black fruits threaded with cedar, smoke, licorice and coffee liqueur. It was aged 32 months in 2–6 year old French oak."
Syrah,"There's a lot of earthy spice character to this wine, as assertive aromas of purple florals, whole cinnamon stick, nutmeg and clove are supported by a frame of small forest berries. Medium weight and round on the palate with a mulled boysenberry-flavored finish."
Syrah,"The challenges of the 2010 vintage were ample, but Longboard has succeeded with this elegant Syrah. With fruit-forward blackberry, cherry, licorice and pepper flavors, it has a smoked meat note that recommends pairing it with barbecue, game birds, or a wild mushroom risotto, especially if you can slice a little truffle onto it."
Syrah,"This wine hews to the Milbrandt style, emphasizing notes of vanilla and tobacco ahead of the simple black-fruit flavor. It has a hint of smoky earthiness and a citrusy edge to the acids."
Syrah,"Billy Wathen and Dick Dore pick this cofermented blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier together on the same day. The result is very savory, with resinous herbs and root beer on the nose. Once sipped, a rainbow of dark flavors emerges: chopped Italian herbs, creosote, black olive, fennel, soy and orange pith, reminiscent of a North African tagine."
Syrah,"This wine displays a broader fruit profile than The Rocks is often known for, with aromas of plum leading to crushed rock, cracked pepper, olive, herbs and smoked meat. The texture is captivating, both elegant in its styling yet rich, commanding attention with floral notes on the finish."
Syrah,"Aromas of dried herbs, green olive, grilled asparagus and smoke lead to intensely concentrated savory flavors with a flat-out dazzling mouthfeel. It's a knockout that overloads the senses."
Syrah,"This is a rustic Syrah, with a simple, grapy flavor. The tannins are a bit rough-and-tumble, but the wine is perfectly quaffable with burgers or pizzas."
Syrah,"This is an attractive, fruit-driven Syrah at an approachable price. Violets and pepper mark the blueberry-scented nose, while the flavors bit up darker notes of blackberry and licorice on the finish. Drink this medium-bodied wine over the next few years."
Syrah,"This is from a cool-climate 9-acre site divided into two blocks, cooled by afternoon breezes off San Pablo Bay. It shows off the site in its embrace of high-toned fruit flavors of plum, blueberry, cranberry and dried cherry, the background meaty in chewy tannin and concentrated oak."
Syrah,"A dark, smoky, earthy Syrah with juicy blackberry and black currant fruits. This wine just coats the palate and seduces; threads of coffee and caramel, baking spices and cinnamon all weave through the lengthy finish. The tannins are supportive but unobtrusive, and the balance is superb. It finishes with a burst of grilled meat."
Syrah,"Coming from a blend of top sites Red Willow and Forgotten Hills, this wine offers reserved aromas of berry, herb, smoked meat and pepper. The palate brings bright acid and intensity of flavor but with a sense of elegance that keeps you hanging on each sip."
Syrah,"Made from 100% Syrah and aged in half new French oak, this brawny Syrah hails from a vineyard known for its mix of power and finesse. Sanguine and smoky, the fruit leans toward blueberry and the texture to leather, a streak of graphite in the background. Tannins are firm and sizable, with a balanced finish."
Syrah,The American oak aging (80%) plays a significant role here but not in a bad way. There are notes of toast and Mounds bar with ripe flavors and a cranberry-filled finish.
Syrah,"Co-fermented with 5% Viognier, mineral-laden aromas of smoked meat, Kalamata olive, earth, flower and funk are followed by shimmering fruit and savory flavors that possess a compelling mouthfeel and lead to an extended finish. The alcohol and oak are dialed back, allowing the fruit to shine."
Syrah,"There's a wildness to this wine, with spicy, Provençal herbs and briary tannins that frame the blackberry, currant, licorice, balsam and cedar flavors. It's tightly wound and dense now, not showing much elegance. But it's interesting and different and could well be an ager. Try after 2011."
Syrah,"This négociant's top cuvée of Saint-Joseph has vibrant mixed berry notes that pick up lovely hints of licorice and garrigue, then turn chocolaty and velvety on the finish. Nicely done all the way around, with a drinking window extending from now through 2017."
Syrah,"Although this Syrah is technically dry, it tastes sweet, almost Porty, with flavors of caramel corn, plumped raisins and cassis. Feels overly tannic, too, with an astringent mouthfeel. Ready now."
Syrah,"Billy Wathen and Dick Dore pick this cofermented blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier together on the same day. The result is very savory, with resinous herbs and root beer on the nose. Once sipped, a rainbow of dark flavors emerges: chopped Italian herbs, creosote, black olive, fennel, soy and orange pith, reminiscent of a North African tagine."
Syrah,"A bouquet of spicy black pepper intoxicates on the opening of this wine, followed by captivating waves of savory blackberry, leather and dust. The grapes are sourced from one of the producer's coolest sites, With well-integrated, unobtrusive oak, the wine is soft and delicious now, offering plenty of meaty undertones, but will intrigue further over time, through 2022."
Syrah,"Light raspberry fruit is enhanced by generous layers of coffee and chocolate. Aromatic and inviting, especially at this price, it brings in a hint of the barnyard on the gently fading finish."
Syrah,"Deeply intriguing and funky aromas of sweet tar, charred blueberries and hot rubber emerge from this study of using minimal amounts of new oak on a typically oak-aged variety. Some may find the reductive nose challenging, but the palate is more approachable, with dark chocolate and cassis flavors."
Syrah,"Intense tannins and full body make this Syrah difficult to savor at this point, but it may round out with aging. It smells like smoke and black pepper, and tastes like grilled beef and blackberries. It is firm and astringent in texture, tight and concentrated in flavor. Best after 2018."
Syrah,"A strong scent and flavor of vitamin pill mixes with tight red fruit, stone, licorice and earth in this Rhône blend that includes small amounts of Grenache and Mourvèdre. Give this wine time to breathe and let the fruit come forward before you drink it."
Syrah,"A harsh wine, soft in texture and simple, with sweet raspberry jam and chocolate flavors that taste oddly acidic."
Syrah,"Roasted and raw beef, dried strawberry, crushed marjoram and salt-and-pepper seasonings show on this Syrah. Extremely dark in the glass, it's bolstered by 4% Grenache, 4% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier. Elderberry fruit kicks off the palate, following by pepper, coffee grinds, espresso beans and dark-chocolate sauce, surrounded by grippy tannins."
Syrah,"Standard value-priced Chilean Syrah in that it's herbal and leafy on the nose, with a mix of olive, earth, spice and dried red fruit aromas. The palate is a bit stretched out and tannic, while the flavor profile is pure olive, herbs and dried cherry. Finishes solid but herbal."
Syrah,"Thick blackberry syrup and loads of black pepper meet with dashes of asphalt and dried violets on the nose of this wine from a vineyard near Los Alamos. The palate combines plum-skin tartness and rustic elderberry with cedar and juniper berries, a pleasant blend of wood and fruit."
Syrah,"There's a soft, candied appeal to the cherry, strawberry and blackberry flavors in this dry, young wine. With a sweet oak jacket, it's clean and pleasant to drink now."
Syrah,"This wine intrigues with its aromas of flowers, blue fruit, pepper and toffee. It's pleasantly sleek in style, well balanced and approachable now, with a finish that lingers."
Syrah,"The California appellation is used because the winery's estate vineyard is in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles—a cool-climate, coastal growing region. This is rewardingly dry and complex, with an intriguing cured-meat note along with ripe blackberry and cassis flavors. The tannin-acid balance is great, making it a very enjoyable wine to drink now with game, lamb and beef."
Syrah,"Richly smooth, this is a beautifully generous wine that brings out the perfumed nature of the Syrah. Ripe with black fruits, it is still packed with dark tannins and dense concentrated fruit. Drink this powerful wine from 2018."
Syrah,"A brisk Syrah, dry and tart, with some notable tannins. It's so rich and sweet in blackberries, beef jerky, carob and spices, you can forgive a few faults, such as excessive acidity."
Syrah,"The oak influence has been trimmed back at Jaboulet in recent vintages, and this wine shows only traces of menthol and cedar. Cracked peppercorns and red cherries form the core aromas and flavors of this medium-bodied but long and mouthwatering wine. Approachable now, but it should age well for at least 10 years."
Syrah,"Not to be confused with the Mae's “Flagship” bottling, which is a more limited reserve, this classy and varietally spot-on wine brings coffee concentrate, red licorice, black cherry cola and a streak of vanilla harmoniously together. The focus and purity are outstanding."
Syrah,"Real Syrah character pervades this dry, full-bodied red wine. It has flavors of blackberries, mulberries, charred meat and black pepper, wrapped into firm tannins. This is a great price for such a versatile, food-friendly wine."
Syrah,"Estate grown, this 100% Syrah has excellent concentration and round, mouthfilling fruit flavors. Cherries and plums are highlighted with baking spices and a finishing wash of rich mocha. Very tasty, forward, and drinking at its best right now."
Syrah,"This rich Syrah leaves little to the imagination. It's dramatic in blackberry and cherry fruit and exotic spices, sweetened with new oak. Delicious now and for the next few years."
Syrah,"If more Syrah tasted like this, the variety just might overtake Cabernet in popularity. It's really good, combining a dry, firm structure with lush flavors, in the way of blackberries, blueberries, currants and a meatiness like the sweet, charred fat on a steak. Kudos to vintner Murray for bottling it in a screwtop."
Syrah,"A lusty wine, soft and exceedingly fruity, as befits its warm origins. Flashy in raspberry and cherry jam, roasted coconut, sweet mocha and cinnamon flavors, with a savory touch of bacon."
Syrah,"The aging program for this Syrah, which comes from a vineyard near the intersection of the Carmel and Salinas valleys, results in a solidly balanced wine. Pepper, boysenberry and game consume the nose, with blackberry fruit, mint, tobacco and a greenish bitterness keeping the palate interesting."
Syrah,"Impressive for its power, a wine of considerable interest and complexity. It's rich in black cherries, red currants, cola, bacon and spice flavors, but the texture really stands up, a combination of firm tannins and brilliant acidity. Oak provides complicating notes of sweet toast. Drink soon."
Syrah,"This is rustic, with notes of roasted berry, smoked meat, leather and dried cheese on the bouquet. It feels tannic and pushy, with herbal, wild flavors of dark berry, herb and roasted meat. Slightly warm and herbal, the finish lasts."
Syrah,"Luscious blackberry and cherry pie filling, dark chocolate and sandalwood flavors dominate this 100% Syrah. It's pretty tasty, but it's high in alcohol, with a hot mouthfeel, and feels too soft for balance. Drink now."
Syrah,"There's lots of youthful, jammy fruit and rich tannins in this Syrah. But then it turns hot with alcohol, and the finish is overripe and raisiny. Your best bet is to drink it soon with stews and barbecue."
Syrah,"Kiona Vineyard on Red Mountain provides the fruit for this wine, along with Chandler Reach in the Yakima Valley. Baking spice, clove and anise aromas are followed by light, tart red fruit flavors that trail slightly toward the spice filled finish."
Syrah,"This distinctive offering is light in color, with aromas of rose petals, red raspberries and minerals. It's supple and elegant in feel, all about purity of expression as it dances lightly on the palate."
Syrah,"All the fruit is from Wahluke Slope vineyard, with 2% Viognier. Aged for 17 months in French oak, this is a big step up from the 2005. The fruit scents are bold and pure, showing lush berry notes and leading gracefully into a darker mix of smoke, coffee grounds, tobacco and licorice. There is a lot of barrel influence, but the fruit is so good that it can take it. This is a wine to drink young and savor."
Syrah,"Atypically round for a Crozes-Hermitage—a result of the vintage—but immediately attractive, with ample weight backing up the smoky, bacony notes and plummy fruit. Finishes long and richly textured, with hints of oak. Drink now–2020."
Syrah,"Initially, sweet, feminine violet notes and juicy, ripe blueberries on the nose and palate make this seem innocent and coquettish. But full body, big, chunky tannins and a vibrant acidity against a backdrop of smoke and char make this wine a compelling pick, and potentially one that could benefit from a few years in the cellar."
Syrah,"This is a touch foxy and feral on the nose, but overall it's an attractive, aggressive wine, with sweaty leather and animal leanings but also a lot of solid fruit and power. It feels round, with a herbal flavor and a cookie note, and a long, juicy and toasty finish."
Syrah,"Sharp acidity accentuates the tannins in this aggressive, dry Syrah, giving the blackberry and cherry flavors a jamminess that suggests pie filling. The official alcohol is amazingly low at 12.4%."
Syrah,"Dark and dense, without turning fat or heavy, this excellent Ruckus captures the underlying minerality of Red Mountain grapes. There's boysenberry and black cherry fruit, black coffee and wet rock. This is built for aging."
Syrah,"A good everyday Syrah. It doesn't show the richness of the single-vineyard bottlings, but it's nice and dry, with berry, cherry, grilled meat, pepper and oak flavors."
Syrah,"Rich in berry, cherry, cola, pepper and sandalwood flavors, but a bit off in texture. Feels jagged and angular, with some green tannins. Ready now."
Syrah,"Aromas of black cherry, brambly berry, violet and oregano give way to sophisticated flavors of dark fruit, spice and leather. This nicely balanced Syrah offers harmonious tannins, with just a touch of grippiness, leading to a smooth, somewhat savory finish."
Syrah,"A Syrah for all the California Zin lovers out there, this is heavy and brimming with dark cherry flavor amid a wall of tannins, leather and earth."
Syrah,"This is a full-bodied, muscular example of Côte Rôtie, with pronounced savory, meaty character tinged with smoke and ash. Yet despite that, it manages to be approachable at the same time, finishing long and velvety. Drink it over the next 5–8 years."
Syrah,"A robust Syrah, simple and direct, but loaded with flavor, with classic tannins and fine coastal acidity. It's power-packed with blackberries, currants, leather and loads of savory baking spices. Drink now."
Syrah,"Though from a cool region, this is a more powerful style of Syrah, showing elegant fudge and caramel notes as well as blackberries, blueberries, espresso cream and strong cola aromas. Tangy black currant and baked black-cherry fruit pop on the palate, along with tobacco, smoked beef and baking spice."
Syrah,"As in 2003 this is a blend of Stillwater Creek and Sundance Vineyard fruit. Some complex aromas of cured meat and smoke are added to an underpinning of berry and currant fruit. This is a graceful wine that will need decanting, but well worth taking the extra time to see what it's all about. Retasted 24 hours after being opened, the wine had blossomed into full-blown flavor."
Syrah,"This reasonably priced Hermitage shows the appellation's hallmark gamy notes. It's a sturdy, moderately full-bodied wine with a richly textured finish. Drink now–2025."
Syrah,"Made in a cool part of Napa Valley in a cool vintage, this Syrah is very dry and tough in youthful tannins. It's too astringent to offer much pleasure now, but has a great heart of ripe blackberry, dark chocolate, leather, tobacco, anise and pepper flavor that should sweeten and emerge as the wine ages. Try holding until after 2009."
Syrah,"Sweet and a bit choppy on the nose, with aromas of wood shavings, mocha, fine herbs and spicy black fruits. Flush, lusty and big across the palate, but juicy and clean, with subtle bush berry and spice flavors. Finishes clean and subtle, with floral accents and a touch of heat. Drink now through 2013."
Syrah,"Woodsy and warm on the bouquet, this has cedary, toasty aromas augmenting notes of milk chocolate and berry fruit. It feels heavy, with berry, leather and herb influences. This is big and oaky on the finish."
Syrah,"Thick, oaky and loaded with toasty highlights, this substantial Syrah slathers its fruit in a heavy coat of caramel, buttered nuts and spice. Delicious and supple, its naturally juicy acidity keeps the wine lively. With substantial breathing time, boysenberry fruit melds with streaks of roasted coffee, clove and tobacco."
Syrah,"A concentrated, intense wine, filled with cherry-berry fruit and more than a hint of vanilla. It's tart and edgy, with some firm tannins on the finish, so hold it another 12 months and then drink it over the next 5–6 years."
Syrah,"Even if you like some earthy, mushroomy notes in your Syrah, this one is unripe to the point of vegetal. It's also too soft for balance. Despite some decent blackberry and cola flavors, it's a real disappointment."
Syrah,"From a vineyard owned by veterans John and Helen Falcone in the Creston district, this expertly integrated bottling combines blackberry jam, thyme and white pepper on the elegant nose. Juicy black and purple fruits arise once sipped, riding a long line of zesty acidity and cracked black-pepper spice, alongside soy, plum sauce and roasted-beef tips."
Syrah,"Drew is single-handedly making a case for the tiny Mendocino Ridge appellation and its ability to nurture intense Syrah with this perfumed wine explosive in black pepper and cherry. Its fine, softly-hewed tannins keep things fresh and sinewy. Complex and dancing in acidity, this Syrah cries out for charcuterie, especially artisan salami, its perfect match in pepper."
Syrah,"Big, rich and extracted, this Syrah is a bit heavy and ponderous now. It shows soft flavors of melted blackberry jam, plum liqueur, dark chocolate, grilled meat and smoky oak, liberally dusted with black pepper. Fancy, but could use through 2009 to knit together."
Syrah,"Dusty and tight, with a whiff of coffee and cocoa introducing an elegant wine with interesting streaks of metal and graphite. Young fruit and fine tannins are in perfect balance, and the wine has a lovely delicacy."
Syrah,"The downtown Santa Barbara winery's luxury-level offering shows wondrous aromas of blackberry, licorice and pepper. The flavors take some patience to show their true colors, but soon reveal blackberry, ollallieberry, some red fruits, wet slate minerality and lavender. Expect those elements to emerge even stronger from 2018 to 2025."
Syrah,"All coming from Stillwater Creek Vineyard, this leads with aromas of green herbs, dark fruit and milk chocolate. It's hedonistic in style with layers of fruit flavors and tart acids that seem a bit out of place."
Syrah,"Black cherries, turned loam and black slate swirl into a standard nose for this winery's workhorse bottling. It's quite tasty on the palate, with blackberries and boysenberries finding complexity amid licorice, slate and black dirt."
Syrah,"Second-generation winemaker Drake Whitecraft taps his friend Matt's vineyard for this fruit-forward bottling, which shows smashed black grapes, black cherry, black raspberry, lavender, lilac and cola on the nose. The palate is juicy with blueberry and blackberry, lifted by violet and lavender, and touched with white pepper spice."
Syrah,"This is high in alcohol, but it will easily pair with barbecue. It's made from fruit grown in the warm Larner Vineyard in Santa Ynez Valley as well as from the cool Lafond Vineyard in Santa Rita Hills. Rich, dry and complex, it offers brisk, citrusy acidity to offset the ripe blackberry, currant and sandalwood flavors."
Syrah,"This wine comes from a select lot from Boushey Vineyard. Reserved aromas of mineral, funk and dark fruit are followed by taught, layered cranberry and cherry that show precision and deftness."
Syrah,"Sugar saves the day in this dessert wine. It's very sweet and fruity, like a blackberry tart with the smoky crust, sauced up with sweetened espresso, shaved chocolate, candied orange zest and roasted coconut flakes."
Syrah,"This unique Syrah vineyard is located at the northwestern edge of the Columbia Valley AVA. Exotic, silky and compelling, the aromas and flavors combine gorgeously sleek berry fruit flavors with a foundation of liquid rock (hence the vineyard name). Supple, authoritative and long, it gathers both strength and subtlety as it breathes."
Syrah,"This, like the winery's other wines from this remote northern region, carries a soupy, stewy, leathery set of aromas. In the mouth, the acidity level is high. Rustic, earthy flavors of beef stew, leafy berry fruits and marinara sauce finish blunt, oaky and herbal."
Syrah,"From a cool section of the appellation, this wine delivers bursts of white pepper and violets on the nose. Dark in color and fierce in aromatics, it continues with a lovely balance of cherry and leather on the palate, alongside juicy, high-toned acidity. Enjoy now or for years to come."
Syrah,"Barrel notes of vanilla, baking spice and dill are at the fore, with dark fruit lurking in the background. The palate brings lingering creamy-feeling fruit and barrel flavors. It provides appeal but the oak seems too forward."
Syrah,"Savory as a weathered leather chair, this vintage of Fenaughty is all spice, smoke and meat, smooth and structured, and remarkably low in alcohol, a feat that's probably pretty challenging to achieve in the Foothills. The firm tannins should keep this fine specimen going for a while in the cellar."
Syrah,"A fairly standard Syrah, softly sweet and direct in berry, mocha, spice and oak flavors. Tons of fruit, but lacks complexity for the price."
Syrah,"Cassis, red licorice candy and leather are the key aromas on this full-bodied, ripe Syrah. Things run big but healthy on the tongue, while flavors of black fruits, toast, coconut and chocolate announce plenty of oak. A rich, persistent finish is just bright enough. Drink through 2015."
Syrah,"As might be expected from winemaker Roman Bratasiuk, this is a full-bodied, rich Syrah, loaded with dark scents of roast coffee, blueberries and baking spices. Blueberry, menthol and spice flavors dominate the palate, finishing long. Despite the massive richness, there's plenty of elegance, too. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited."
Syrah,"Asphalt and gaseous aromas take a while to settle, but after they do, leather and scratchy blackberry scents surface. It feels big and brawny, with max extraction. It tastes masculine but salty, with bitter chocolate and peppery accents. Bulky for $11 wine."
Syrah,"A Rhône blend that will, in future vintages, not be varietally named, this is far from a standard Washington Syrah. It's threaded beautifully with nuances of fruit and spice from the Viognier coferment, Grenache and Mourvèdre that are included. Aromatic, spicy and weaving together chocolate, licorice, granite, roasted meat and berry flavors, it is both substantial and forward."
Syrah,"Half was whole-cluster fermented, yielding dense scents and flavors with black olive, herb and a touch of mocha. Cranberry, raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are smooth and detailed, and the tannins firm and polished."
Syrah,"This standout Rocks District wine brings earth shaking aromas of black-olive brine, tapenade, green olive, stargazer lilies, orange peel and crushed gravel. The smoked meat, charcuterie and blue-fruit flavors don't hold back, bringing a lovely sense of texture and detail. It's an intense wine that completely demands your attention."
Syrah,"A massive Syrah that impresses for sheer volume. It's full-bodied and rich in blackberries, black currants, bacon, black pepper, anise and smoky oak, folded into thick, ripe tannins. Tastes juicy and fresh now, perfect for a grilled steak, and should develop for up to five years before losing its fruit."
Syrah,"Unripe, with green peppercorn, tobacco and dried sage flavors, showing only a slender note of blackberries. Good and dry, but lacks richness. Drink now."
Syrah,"A good amount of earthy spice, tea leaves and forrest floor lead the way on the nose, but the black cherry and berry fruit aromas follow shortly after with an additional accent of sweet cured meat. Medium weight and lush, the creamy mouth transitions into a finish loaded with sweet spice and bittersweet cocoa."
Syrah,"The very hot vintage took its toll on this 100% varietal Syrah. While it's nicely dry, with a finely tannic structure, it tastes a bit soft and hot. The cherry and blackberry flavors have a dessicated, raisiny edge. Drink now."
Syrah,"Black in the glass and dense with aromas of cooked blueberry, vanilla, maple syrup, brown sugar, tar, fudge and fresh purple flowers, this wine takes ripeness and concentration to impressive heights. Lavish on the palate with sticky, grippy tannins, the flavors of blueberry fudge, cola, black pepper and lavender are bold and delicious."
Syrah,"Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this tart and sharp-edged Washington Syrah sports bright berry fruit and just a hint of earth in the tannins. The acids are a little chalky, and there is a slight medicinal quality in the back of the mouth as the wine finishes."
Syrah,"Fresh boysenberries and a blueberry sorbet character mix with notes of minty tarragon, dill and hot gravel on the nose of this wine, from an area between Gilroy and Morgan Hill. Peppercorns are prominent on the relatively light palate, along with tobacco, espresso and boysenberry."
Syrah,"Blackberry fruit is the focus of this one-dimensional Syrah. Some coffee flavors come into play, presumably from barrel aging, and the tannins are rough and grainy."
Syrah,"This Syrah is overripe. It has a taste of raisins and prunes­—a baked, Porty quality—like the grapes had been grilled before being made into wine."
Syrah,"Black-cherry-cola aromas along with lots of licorice and Dr Pepper spice show on the nose of this bottling from a relatively new winery in northeast Paso Robles. There is slight sweetness to the palate, with baked cherry and baking-spice flavors. Accents of dried blackberry, leather, dried meat and purple flower add complexity."
Syrah,"Saturated and black as night, with floral aromas mixed with earth, juniper and pruney fruit. Meaty and dark flavors ride on a bed of leathery, grabby tannins. Spicy, meaty and a touch herbal on the grinding, tannic finish."
Syrah,"Aromas of coffee, barrel spice and dark-blue fruit lead to rich, full-bodied blackberry and spice flavors. It's not for the faint of heart but delivers a lot of enjoyment."
Syrah,"A big, savory Syrah from Mendocino's well-known Eaglepoint Ranch that's been aged in neutral oak but retains layers of tar and caramel on the finish. Let this wine open before pairing it with rich, meaty fare."
Syrah,"A big, woody, totally modern style of Syrah. There is a lot more coconut, mocha and big berry fruit than anything you might find from France. It's dark and layered on the palate, with coconut and resin supporting black fruit. Finishes smoky and oaky, but structured, tannic and serious enough to impress."
Syrah,Aromas of tobacco and spice are light and reserved. The palate offers tangy cherry flavors that persist on the finish.
Syrah,"Char, sawdust and black cherry aromas confirm the wine's “oak cask” labeling. Full bodied and ripe, it conveys meaty thickness and bold flavors of berry and spiced plum. A toasty, charred finish is lifted by bright acidity and fresh black-fruit flavors. This will go well with just about anything off the grill."
Syrah,"Made entirely with Syrah, this concentrated wine delivers plum, black pepper, cocoa, coffee, fleshy black cherry and notes of bay leaf. It's plush, soft and savory but it also seems shy on vibrancy and essential energy. Drink sooner rather than later."
Syrah,"Randall Grahm notes that this is one of his best Syrahs from this historic vineyard, and it's hard to disagree. Aromas of gravel, just-crushed peppercorns and blueberries lead into a lighter, airy, mineral-driven palate of black rocks, black pepper and boysenberry fruit. It's one of the better cool-climate Syrahs around right now."
Syrah,"Unforthcoming on the nose, it offers mild aromas of red fruits and flowers. Soft and fluid in feel, the palate is imbued with flavors of raspberries and dried herbs. It finishes with a loose, open-knit texture."
Syrah,"So rich with cherries, red currants, bacon and pepper, this is a terrific wine to drink now. There's an edge of sweet, smoky oak that makes it particularly enticing, while that Edna Valley acidity is as brisk as can be."
Syrah,"Aged a little more than two years in 90% new French oak and then in bottle, time has been kind to this wine, a Syrah of dark mushroom and baked blackberry, that's savory and silky with a slight hint of mint on the finish. Mighty and impressive."
Syrah,This older vintage Syrah still has some fruit but otherwise shows drying tannins and leathery smoke.
Syrah,"While the wine is very ripe in character, it is also finely structured and generous while still keeping a sense of proportion. It is dense, full of blackberry jelly flavors that are balanced by a final burst of acidity. Drink now, although better from early 2017."
Syrah,"This is a European-style Syrah, cofermented with 2% Viognier. It's soft and round, medium in body, and has a savory midpalate with flavors of cranberry, plum and pepper. On the finish is a hint of smoky oak. Profits from sales of the wine go to the American River Conservancy Wakamatsu Colony Preservation and Restoration project."
Syrah,"This wine is a big one, going all out to make friends. New-oak aromas like clove, cedar and cinnamon explode out of the glass, then flavors of dark chocolate and cherry spread across the palate for a generous—almost thick—impression. Fine layers of tannins and firm acidity blanket the texture."
Syrah,"One of the most famous Crozes-Hermitage bottlings, the 2005 Domaine de Thalabert is a little tough and unyielding right now, but shows promise in its persistent, peppery finish. It starts off with gamy, leathery notes and hickory smoke, all backed by crisp blackberry fruit and ample tannin. Try after 2012."
Syrah,"A gorgeous wine, dense with flavor. Smooth and plummy, it's loaded with thick streaks of licorice, chocolate, baking spices and coffee liqueur. Long and flowing, it just seduces from the first sip to the last swallow."
Syrah,"Tough, gritty,  peppery and bone dry, this junior version of the winery's higher-priced Syrahs is a good, country-style wine. It really needs a grilled steak or a rich, hard cheese to balance it."
Syrah,"This appealing offering has aromas of smoke, char, coffee and berry. It shows a sense of restraint and elegance while still displaying depth and balance to the lingering dark fruit and savory flavors."
Syrah,"Pure, inviting and open, with cedar, tobacco, blackberry, earth and cookie dough aromas scattered all over a robust bouquet. Deep but fresh, with fine balance and a bold, jammy set of blackberry and black-pepper flavors. Finishes well, with integration and easygoing tannins. Drink now through 2013."
Syrah,"Bright and vivacious black and red berries meet with dill, mint and white sage on the nose of this bottling from a historic vineyard, with a touch of sweet pine wood as well. Dried purple flowers are prominent on the sip, where touches of asphalt, charcoal and beef in a blackberry sauce are boosted by peppery spice."
Syrah,"Dark purple on the pour, this is a big, rich, Shiraz-style Syrah, dense in blackberries, black currants, grilled bacon on oak. It's tannic and dry, yet ripe with fruit. Very high alcohol gives it some heat that calls for barbecue."
Syrah,"This is a blend of the three of the producer's single-vineyards, 42% from Atoosa, 29% Samantha and 29% Moaveni. The whole is greater than its parts in its complementary marriage of floral violet and lavender with black pepper and meat, the texture soft and plush."
Syrah,"An interesting Syrah, this weaves together light influences of vanilla, coffee and tea around beautifully integrated fruit flavors of citrus, blueberry and black currant. The balance is just right, and the melding of these seemingly disparate flavors is handled perfectly."
Syrah,"This medium- to full-bodied wine is smooth in texture, not overly firm or tannic. Floral and peppery notes accent cassis-tinged fruit, which finishes in a flourish of supple tannins. Drink now–2022."
Syrah,"This dry-farmed vineyard reliably delivers memorable wines, including this Syrah, redolent with notes of oregano, thyme, charred beef and tar. The herbs, fruit and smoke integrate smoothly on the palate, with boysenberry fruit in the background and crushed bouquet garni on the front."
Syrah,"Syrah is still finding its way in Washington, and a certain sameness affects many of these wines. This tastes like the product of relatively young vines; spicy, leafy and lightly peppery, with tart cranberry and raspberry fruit, it's balanced and similar to a lighter Zin from the Dry Creek Valley; tasty and fresh, without over-reaching."
Syrah,"Consistent with the Lake Chelan winery's lineup of red wines, this young Syrah brings a lot of generous, berry-flavored primary fruits, softened tannins and a deep purple color. The opening cherry and berry fruit, turning a little pruney and limned by citrusy acids, leads into a tart midpalate with some earth and granite underlying the fruit."
Syrah,"This immediately appealing wine offers aromas of plum, confection, blueberry, black olive and cocoa. The fruit flavors are sweet and concentrated, backed by lightly chalky tannins that will benefit from some time in the cellar."
Syrah,"An elegant and well-balanced Syrah, initial scents of red cherry and brambly berry lead into more refined notes of cola spice, game, leather and a touch of sweet smoke. The palate is smooth and easy, with silky tannins that are surprisingly approachable and red cherry and berry flavors that are bright and refreshing. Final hits of white pepper and cured game grace the medium-length finish."
Syrah,"Hints of ceder, bramble and smoked nuts add savory complexity to this ripe, full-bodied Syrah full of succulent black cherry and berry flavors. It's approachable yet elegant, framed by soft, feathery tannins and a zesty spray of cranberry acidity add. Drink now through 2018."
Syrah,"There's a purity and wholesome quality to this lovely Syrah. It's dry and soft as velvet, with rich flavors of blackberries, mocha, leather, violets, black pepper and sandalwood. Best now and for a year or two."
Syrah,"Spice, cherry and chewy blueberry characterize this youthful Syrah from Sicily. This is a generous and proud value wine that delivers aromas of white pepper, plum, dark fruit and hickory smoke. It offers an easy, pleasurable drinking experience that won't hit your wallet."
Syrah,"This is the winery's French-oaked Syrah, thick and smoky, with a balanced mix of red and black fruits, nicely retained acids, and layers of creamy oak. The alcohol hits 14.6% but the wine remains smooth and supple. Barrel flavors expand into a lingering finish with butterscotch, mocha and spice."
Syrah,"Superb fruit highlights this tight, sculpted Syrah. It's extremely dense, with deep and intense raspberry and cassis fruit flavor, augmented with coffee grounds, smoke and iron filings. Complex, detailed, balanced and deep—what more can a wine give you? This is drinking very young and surely needs to be decanted. But already displaying amazing power."
Syrah,"Dried blueberry fruit, asphalt, black plums and chocolate sauce aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend by the Rhône specialist. Tart black fruit, tar, fudge and fresh purple flowers show on the palate, an always reliable intro to the popular Central Coast grape."
Syrah,"Directly appealing, this wine is bursting with aromas of plum, red currant, herb and spice–all showing freshness and purity. The palate is packed to the brim with supple fruit flavors, full of density and weight, while never getting bogged down. It hits the delicious gong hard."
Syrah,"Impressively thick and dark for Joey Tensley's new entry-level brand, this wine's deep and dark aromas of slate-flecked soil makes for a very earthy impression on the nose, along with expected hints of tar, purple flowers and boysenberry. Condensed cassis flavors show on the sip along with hints of lavender and blueberry, laced together by soft tannins and an upright acidity."
Syrah,"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones. It's aromatically expressive with black olive, crushed flowers, mineral, black pepper and an earthy funk. Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish."
Syrah,"Made entirely with Syrah, this has aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, French oak, leather and cedar. The full-bodied palate offers cured meat, dried blackberry, ground pepper and anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins."
Syrah,"Though it's relatively light for Syrah, this offers flavors that are true to classic varietal characteristics. Red and purple berries, anise and a vein of steel are all in the mix, and continue through a gentle fade-out."
Syrah,"A crazy amount of peppercorn, from white to black to green to red, pops on the nose of this bottling by the legendary Adam Tolmach. Aromas also convey dried violet, black gravel and the slightest touch of blueberry. The pepper spice is almost unbelievable on the sip, where it spices up the soy and coffee-bean flavors."
Syrah,"Dark red in color, there's an intense—for lack of a better word—grapy quality to this rustic wine. Kirsch and orange highlight the experience, before a faint structure falls short on the finish."
Syrah,"One of a trio of very limited, single-vineyard Quady North Syrahs, this is lightly funky and compact, with lovely details throughout. Blueberry, plum and cherry fruit combine, underscored with an earthy funkiness. The ying–yang of citrus and leather bounces along through the finish. Never boring, and a bit challenging, this is also a good value."
Syrah,"This coastal Syrah smells reduced and funky, with notes of juniper, blueberry and green herbs. A jammy, saturated palate is more flat and dull than ideal, while flavors of stewed, herbal blue fruits and carob finish minty and green."
Syrah,"From 86% Syrah and 14% Zinfandel grapes, this is a dark wine, burgundy-orange in color and equally dense at first on the palate. It picks up freshness as it opens, disrobing flavors of wild strawberry and grapefruit, along with an intensity of blackberry. Bright, it finishes dry."
Syrah,"Winemaker Scott Hawley delivers deep and dark aromas of blueberry and mint against a backdrop of bacon fat and barrel smoke. The mouthfeel is rich and lush, with more blueberry plus anise, black licorice and a canvas of minty herbs that also reveal a touch of bitterness."
Syrah,"This wine brings charming aromas of cracked pepper, smoked meat, dried herbs and crushed violets, with dark chocolate and mixed fruit lurking in the background. The green olive and other savory flavors are restrained, coating the palate with a soft, textured feel that shows precise balance. It demands attention without overwhelming."
Syrah,"The dried herb and violet aromas are high toned, seeming locked up still. The floral and smoked meat flavors are elegant in style, backed by lightly grainy tannins and a flower filled finish. The focus is on delicacy and nuance, and it brings plenty of both."
Syrah,"Savory aromas of black pepper, teriyaki-glazed steak, charcoal and elderberry jam converge for a compelling nose on this bottling. There is a strong soy richness to the sip, with grilled black plums and alder smoke flavors. It's the perfect barbecue wine."
Syrah,"Bright pink in color with orange highlights, this light-bodied wine tastes fresh, lightly fruity like raspberries and cranberries. It has a crispy tangy acidity for an appetizing texture."
Syrah,"Co-fermented with 5% Viognier, this Syrah is direct and appealing with notes of boysenberry jam, smoked meat and orange peel. The palate is soft and sumptuous in feel with tart fruit flavors."
Syrah,"Sharp, minty-peppery and tannicly dry in its youth, this Syrah is rich enough in fruit to warrant some years in the cellar. That could give it time to soften and let the ripe blackberry, chocolate, coffee and gingersnap cookie flavors out. Try 2009–2011."
Syrah,"Smoke meets game on the nose of this wine from a vineyard named after Fess Parker's late son-in-law, along with blueberry and asphalt aromas. The flavors are rich and dense, with blackberry, tart boysenberry and more smoked meat, proving the perfect pairing for hearty fare."
Syrah,"Feels lush and extravagant in the mouth, a full-bodied wine with smooth tannins housing powerhouse black cherry, bacon, black pepper and oaky sandalwood flavors. Give it a bit more structural integrity, and the score would soar."
Syrah,"Too sweet and soft, like a confection in a glass. Tastes like a raspberry and cherry tart, spiced with cinnamon and dusted with cocoa, and turns hot and Porty-like on the finish."
Syrah,"An unusual opening of cookie dough and black-fruit aromas suggests a ripe wine, and this is definitely on the full side. While the palate is chunky and lacks a distinct focal point, flavors of tomato, herbs and baked plum are complex and meaty. A leathery feel along with herbal plum flavors defines the finish."
Syrah,"Software developer-turned-vintner Mike Officer comes south from his Sonoma base to Monterey make this lavish Syrah that shows layers of blueberry, blackberry and black cassis as well as potpourri and ganache elements. Those same fruits hit the sip too, along with licorice, pretty purple flowers and an ever-increasing asphalt component."
Syrah,"Easily worth the price for its luxurious texture, fine structure and intricate layers of flavor. Dry and softly tannic, the wine shows complex notes of blackberries, cherries, pomegranates, chocolate, coffee, leather, black pepper and anise. Now through 2010."
Syrah,"This Syrah appeals to all the senses, leading with blackberry, bramble, kirsch, mineral and crushed flower aromas. The palate is rich and dense, holding nothing back with its opulent black fruit flavors. A hedonistic expression of the variety."
Syrah,"The aromas of green herb and dark berries give the perception of being underripe, with a green undertone along with notes of black licorice. The palate is elegant in style, pulling up toward the finish."
Syrah,"From a warm vintage, this Syrah is raisiny and jammy up front but more staunch and structured as it opens. Aromas of baked fruits arrive at a big, saturated palate full of blackberry, vanilla and coconut flavors. Cherry, chocolate and graphite work the finish on this ripe, warm wine. Drink through 2016."
Syrah,"This 100% varietal wine offers lightly volatile notes of vanilla, coconut, pepper and dried cherries. The fruit flavors show good concentration along with a beguiling feel and a finish that lingers. Although the wood takes center stage, it plays its part well."
Syrah,"Young and still tightly-wound, this excellent example of Yakima valley Syrah combines fruit from both Boushey and Olsen, two of the best sites for the grape anywhere in Washington. Aged in 30% new oak, it's showing generous streaks of graphite, smoke and char, with accents of cured meat around the blackest of black fruits. Well-named and well-constructed."
Syrah,"Topel uses the Syrah Noir clone that was originally sourced from M. Chapoutier to make this tasty wine. It's packed with spicy red fruit and smooth, silky tannins. On the finish, it has a leathery tobacco note, with the richness of a cinnamon roll. Enjoy this with meaty dishes."
Syrah,"This 100% estate-grown Syrah remains obstinately hard and tight, with a strongly tannic streak. Tangy and concentrated fruit flavors include boysenberry and loganberry jam, with a streak of graphite and stone. Give it a lot of breathing time—decanting would be best."
Syrah,"Here's a soft, fruity Syrah that brings to mind drinking with a ham sandwich slathered with mayo. The gentle texture frames succulent flavors of cherries, red currants, cola and salty crackers."
Syrah,"One of two Sparkman Syrahs, Darkness showcases fruit from two stellar Yakima valley vineyards, Boushey and Olsen. A whiff of Syrah funk, herb and earth ties into dried blueberry with a brambly, plummy component. Lovely details of nutmeg with a streak of vanilla keep the flavors interesting through a long finish."
Syrah,"Deep violet and lavender flowers mesh with soy, beef char, uncrushed peppercorns, asphalt, mocha and black sesame on the nose of this bottling. The mouthfeel is medium weight and bursting with energetic acidity, offering flavors of pepper and bright boysenberry that would complement any barbecue or burger."
Syrah,"Pure Syrah from 14-year-old vines, this offers classic peppery aromatics, blue fruits, good concentration, and a hint of the Walla Walla funk that marks the better Syrahs of the region. It's lifted with excellent acidity and continues into a focused finish with highlights of coffee grounds."
Syrah,"This joint venture between Nicolas Jaboulet and the Perrin family is turning out some good examples from the Northern Rhône, like this Côte Rôtie, which is plummy, yet at the same time loaded with savory notes of cured meat and smoke, even a hint of bacon fat. Silky tannins frame the finish. Drink now–2017."
Syrah,"The esteemed Hyde Vineyard is in Carneros, and is the source for some incredible Syrahs from winemakers like Joseph Phelps and the Hyde Vineyard label itself, and Mira now joins that list. The wine is wonderful. Made from 100% Syrah, it's high in alcohol, offering rich, dense waves of blackberry and blueberry jam, chocolate, peppercorn and vanilla."
Syrah,"Thick, soft and sweetly extracted in blackberries and licorice, this Syrah can best be described as rustic. It's not bad, just simple."
Syrah,"Ripe, earthy black-fruit aromas are spicy and a bit lactic from oak, hence, the palate is full and creamy, but with a good acidic cut. Blackberry, herbal spice and cool toasty oak flavors finish warm and plump."
Syrah,"This wine starts off a bit smoky and cedary, but with time it develops more typical Hermitage notes of cassis, hickory smoke and meat. It's medium to full in body, with a rich texture and long finish. Approachable now, but should age easily through 2018."
Syrah,"This Syrah is bone dry, tannic and simple. The blackberry jam and pepper flavors are tasty, but unable to rise above the astringency. Drink now."
Syrah,"Steely and compact, this rather reluctantly opens to reveal subtle complexity. The mix of tart blueberry and blackberry fruit is accompanied by scents of cured meat, menthol and garrigue. It spent 18 months in a mix of barrels and puncheons, yielding a pleasant finishing impression of cedar. Decant this for at least an hour or two."
Syrah,"Brooding aromas of huckleberry, orange peel and flowers are followed by seamless full-bodied palate-coating blue-fruit flavors. It's far from shy but delivers the goods."
Syrah,"The most round, smooth and full in terms of mouthfeel of all the Cayuse Syrahs, this is excellent in every way. Dark and meaty, it's tightly wound and dense with black and roasted fruits, smoke, carpaccio and cacao. The Armada Syrah offers outstanding length, depth and complexity."
Syrah,"There are delicious flavors in this ripe Syrah, and while it's too soft for comfort, it sure is nice to drink. Offers waves of blackberries, mocha, black pepper and smoky sandalwood that finish thoroughly dry and complex in Asian spices."
Syrah,"The oak shows itself first on this wine with aromas of vanilla and coconut in front of sappy fruit. The flavors are full bodied, equal parts fruit and barrel, with vanilla taking the lead on the finish. There are good things but the oak dominates."
Syrah,"Slightly hard, burnt and earthy at first, with dark fruit sitting below that cap. The palate is tannic, thus the mouthfeel clamps down and closes up like a clam. More generous and savory in terms of flavors, with roasted black fruit and aged cheese notes. Narrow and grapey on the finish, but legit."
Syrah,"On the juicy nose, this bottling shows Concord grape, suave violet and lilac flowers and the slightest touch of tar. It's lighter in body and quite easy to quaff, with flavors of sea-salt caramel and dense olallieberry."
Syrah,"A dark and richly spicy wine, with penetrating varietal scents of pepper and berry. The wine is tart and youthful, and along with the tangy flavors of berry and spice there is a layer of graphite and a hint of cured meat reaching into the finish. It's sappy, racy and bright, but also layered and showing ageworthy potential. Tannins just hint at green tea."
Syrah,"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, aromas of herb, red fruit, flower and spice are at the fore. The palate is full with red and black-fruit flavors with a lightly tacky feel."
Syrah,"Half of the fruit was sourced from the outstanding Lewis Vineyard, and the dense, dark, purple berry flavors are compelling. Highlights of black olive, smoke, and a bit of stem and earth add complexity. Give this one some breathing time, or cellar it for a few more years to soften the muscular tannins."
Syrah,"The entrance of violets and black cherry is offset by volatility and lingering scents and flavors of nail polish through the wine's mid-palate. It finishes with earthy, rough tannins"
Syrah,"This has lovely raspberry and cranberry fruit, with beautifully laid-in highlights of baking spice, white pepper and dried herb. Some early suggestions of cured meat are also starting to show, but the fruit is the real star, sappy and juicy and deep without being heavy or hot."
Syrah,"Aromas of beach tar and blackberry jam show on the nose of this wine from White Hawk Vineyard by Clarissa Nagy, also winemaker at Riverbench. The palate is also quite tarry, with concentrated blackberry flavors, hints of teriyaki and a strong acidic backbone."
Syrah,"Though labeled as a Syrah, this drinks more like a GSM, with 11% Mourvèdre, 5% Grenache and 2% Viognier contributing prominently to the blend. Aromas of cocoa, orange peel, coffee grounds, raspberry and dark fruit are followed by full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors."
Syrah,"Man O' War's 2008 Dreadnought put the winery on the map, and, although not quite as dramatic, the 2009 is a worthy successor. Aromas are lifted, peppery and cherry-filled, while the flavor nuances include smoke and pepper-cured meats. The wine is medium bodied and is marked by silky tannins and crisp acids. Drink now–2018."
Syrah,"With the fruit coming from Stillwater Creek Vineyard, the aromas offer notes of coffee, cocoa, smoke, vanilla and purple fruit. The flavors are elegant in style, with nubby tannins providing the frame."
Syrah,"Michael Gill goes for broke booze-wise on this hot number, but the rewards are worth the risk. Aromas of blueberry, mint, graphite, dried cherry, lilac and graphite get a sagebrush lift. On the palate, distinct black licorice accompany blackberry syrup and white pepper. There's a slight bit of alcoholic burn on the finish, but it doesn't drink as hot as you'd guess."
Syrah,"Strong in flavor and smooth in the mouth, this soft, juicy Syrah is like velvet made of blackberries, blueberries and chocolate. It is, in a word, delicious, and while it's somewhat sweet, the acidity and minerality balance it."
Syrah,"Blended from Williamson, Hells Canyon and Bitner vineyards, this is a light, airy Syrah, with notes of cranberries and orange rind. There's intrigue, but the wine comes off as a bit muddled."
Syrah,"Blended with 10% Mourvèdre and 5% Viognier, this is an impressive offering with notes of smoke, vanilla, spice, and smoked meat. It's light in style, silky soft in feel without an ounce of extra alcoholic fat to weigh it down."
Syrah,"Aromatically speaking, this is shaky due to murky earthy berry aromas that suggest peanut butter. In the mouth, this is compact and fairly full. Collapsed berry and plum flavors include notes of gritty earthy spice, while this is blocky and pounding on the finish."
Syrah,"Coming from the winery's SJR Vineyard in The Rocks District, this blockbuster wine displays savory aromas of green olive, sea breeze, smoked meat, peat and earth along with coffee and plum. The palate shows great concentration and richness but also deftness, delineation and precision. It's a complete head turner that shows a true sense of place."
Syrah,"High alcohol sticks out on this wine, giving it a dry heat, while raisin flavors suggest a port-like overripeness. It's not going anywhere, so drink up."
Syrah,"Subtle, nuanced aromas of ash, black pepper, crushed flowers and mineral are followed by a lithe, restrained palate mixing fruit and savory flavors. It shows a very pretty sense of balance and tension."
Syrah,"Cracked pepper and black olive aromas give this wine a savory cast, and they're followed up on the palate by hints of charred meat. It's medium-bodied and supple, with a soft, slightly diffuse finish that suggests drinking not cellaring. Drink now–2025."
Syrah,"Lilac, crème de cassis and grape Jolly Rancher scents are layered with anise and lavender touches on the nose of this bottling from one of the winery's favorite vineyards. The palate dives into deep fruit flavors, like concentrated boysenberry and olallieberry, enlivened by Christmas spice, juniper and pine. It's all framed by an intense and unwavering tannic structure. Drink now–2028."
Syrah,"Spicy purple fruits come up quickly, followed by flavors of leaf, earth and stem. Tannins are tight and slightly coarse, and it ends suddenly."
Syrah,"This 100% Syrah offers aromas of mature black currant, charred earth and a whiff of cedar. The palate delivers dried black cherries, clove, ground pepper and powdered sage alongside raspy tannins that leave a drying, astringent finish."
Syrah,This intriguing wine conveys aromas of coffee bean and barrel spices. The palate is restrained with a low-alcohol feel and coffee flavors. The concentration isn't all there but it still piques the interest.
Syrah,"This is the real stuff, with pepper, blackberry, smoke and an earthy note. Drinks lush and complex. Sheer heaven, with impeccable precision and cohesion of blackberry liqueur, oak and lush tannins."
Syrah,"Perfumed and floral on the nose, but also spicy and slightly foresty, which is apropos for Syrah. Flavors of black olive, brandied cherry and blackberry are perfectly nice, and the feel is mildly creamy and rich but still pointed. Finishes with toasty notes of pepper, brown sugar and woodspice."
Syrah,"Definitively taking a cool-climate approach, this 100% varietal wine opens with indelible wafts of violets and white pepper, followed by a presence of more pepper and black currant around a medium-sized body. Earthy leather and mushroom pronounce themselves on the midpalate before it finishes in black licorice."
Syrah,"Almost blue-black in color with a red-violet rim, this Syrah presents aromas of blackberry, mocha and a hint of green pepper. Simultaneously refreshing and well-rounded, it has pleasant flavors of blackberry, orange rind and chocolate-covered espresso bean."
Syrah,"Brooding aromas of herb, dark fruit and spice lead to full bodied cranberry and cherry flavors that bring a lot of oomph. It's a delicious example of the variety."
Syrah,"The aromas bring immediate appeal, with notes of brown stems, herbs, crushed flowers, smoked meat and black pepper. The flavors don't disappoint, showing purity, focus and generosity with a spot-on sense of balance and a lengthy finish that kicks it up a notch. Give it time to open up."
Syrah,"Violets, blackberries and espresso beans whirl together into a delicious, silky nose on this wine by Josh Baker and Matt Brain. It's similarly luxurious on the palate, soft and sensual with lots of boysenberry and olallieberry. It also shows a peppery licorice spice, boosted by focused acidity that enlivens every part of the tongue."
Syrah,This single-vineyard wine offers wild blueberry with vanilla and herb accents. It's full bodied and high-octane in feel with the flavors running straight down the fairway.
Syrah,"Sharp acidity and less-than-ripe green flavors are found in this Syrah, which was blended with a little Grenache. Notes of sour blackberry and cherry candy also surface, and it finishes bone dry."
Syrah,"With ripe blackberry and cherry flavors, the fruit of this dry wine stands out, making it enjoyable despite very tough tannins that currently make it astringently sandpapery. A good effort, although the challenge for Unti is to tame those fierce tannins."
Syrah,"This is 100% varietal, sourced from three excellent Red Mountain vineyards—Klipsun, Kiona and Ciel du Cheval. It seamlessly fuses flavors of fruit, barrel (35% new) and the minerality of the terroir, with a generous midpalate of blackberry and black cherry, soaked in liquorous oak. Highlights of mineral, pepper and a whiff of brioche come into play as well. Lovely as it is already, look for further improvement through 2019–2022."
Syrah,"This lively, muscular, full-bodied wine ripples with smoky, meaty, peppery aromas. A thick, almost chewy texture partners with rowdy blackberry flavors and vivid tannins that will tame the rarest steak or wildest game."
Syrah,"Intriguing aromas of plum, savory spice and smoke lead this rich Syrah. Balanced flavors of ripe plum, mint, pepper and spice paired with structured tannins and a lingering spicy finish give the wine an ageable character. Intense and assertive."
Syrah,"From the Stoney Vine vineyard, this shows the effects of a cool vintage on young vines. There's a lot of citrus and pineapple throughout, and the berry fruit flavors, characteristic of Syrah, are present in the background. There are pleasing accents of carpaccio and peat moss, and just a hint of Bourbon from the third-use, Wisconsin oak barrels. This definitely needs extensive breathing time, or further bottle age."
Syrah,"Though lightly ripened, this opens with classic varietal aromas of mint, spicy berry and pepper. It tends slightly to the green side of the fruit spectrum, with the acidity to age a bit further."
Syrah,"Already six years old, this is in full bloom, offering aromas of jammy red and black fruit sprinkled with cocoa and iron. Flavors show purity and richness, with barrel influences dialed back."
Syrah,"Clear, well-defined varietal scents of pepper, licorice and boysenberry cut through, with a hint of fresh-cut tobacco. A substrate of granite underscores this ripe, supple, medium-long wine with good grip and a polished mouthfeel. Drink 2015 through 2020."
Syrah,"This dense and ripe Syrah offers mature black-skinned fruit, allspice and smoke tones. Its core of ripe black currant fruit is accented with a confectionary note of vanilla and punctuated by rounded tannins. Enjoy soon."
Syrah,"This pure Syrah—the first reserve Syrah from Gorman—pulls out all the stops. It's a tannic, bold, earthy and powerful wine that's loaded with black fruits. Aged for 20 months in 100% new French oak, it takes the wood in stride, adding Red Mountain minerality to the mix."
Syrah,"This bottling is a reference to the Guns 'n' Roses hit song, and proves to be quite a destination itself, with aromas of cocoa, coffee, smoked meats, ginger snaps and cinnamon strudel against a canvas of deep blueberry. Tannins provide tension on the palate, with rich flavors of mocha and blackberry, coming in just a tad hot."
Syrah,"Time has not tamed this in-your-face, oaky, high-octane Syrah, which on the label says it's also known as “rasta red.” The wine is very tannic, smelling of earth and tar and sticky caramel and could use a touch more fruitiness to give it a lift. Do not attempt to drink without a sauce-slathered side of beef."
Syrah,"Ripe berry and cassis aromas are supported by sweet oak scents and related notes of graphite, vanilla and maple. This high-end Syrah is flush, full bodied and widespread. Flavors of oak, vanilla and mocha are up to the wine's rich blackberry and cassis fruit, while a plump wide finish with smooth tannins includes doses of mocha and coffee. Drink through 2023."
Syrah,"This all-Sicilian Syrah opens with smoky or burnt aromas of asphalt and toasted nut. There is some distant red fruit in the background, along with tangy citrus and dill."
Syrah,"With flavors of grilled meat, sweetly charred bone, blackberries, black pepper and other zesty spices, this is a fine Syrah to enjoy with lamb or beef. It's very dry, with tannins that are strong, but refined. Drink now."
Syrah,"A pretty simple little Syrah, fruity and sweet in cherries, with a sugary finish. Will pair nicely with a cheeseburger."
Syrah,"The nose on this Syrah is ripe, with plum and raisiny aromas. It's lively in the mouth, albeit raw feeling, with red berry, plum and currant flavors. A short, mildly oaky finish closes the show."
Syrah,"The Dalton Ranch is a special vineyard source for Newsome-Harlow and its ability to grow great fruit shows in this wine, a Syrah black in color, boastful in earthy ripe, bright violet, blackberry and raspberry, the tannins subtle and softened."
Syrah,"Thin and tight, this high-acid Syrah is stubbornly closed. It's difficult to predict when—or if—it will open up. Right now, it doesn't show much beyond acid and stem."
Syrah,"Shows fine pedigree in the ripeness and finesse of the tannins, which are as pure as velvet. Flavorwise, this Syrah is very ripe, bursting in blackberry, black cherry, pomegranate, licorice and mocha flavors that are almost sweet on the finish. It's made in the modern Napa style, and not an ager."
Syrah,"Sweet, grapey fruit, plum and cherry, enhanced with peppery spice. The tannins are a bit ashy, but well integrated; with not too much oak. Overall, a balanced and elegant approach."
Syrah,"The aromas are near completely closed up on first pour, with whiffs of marionberry, herb and barrel spice. The palate brings dense tightly wound fruit flavors. It needs some time to stretch its legs but there are plenty of good things going on once they come to the surface."
Syrah,"Lots of fruity richness in this dry Syrah. Shows blackberry, chocolate, licorice and pie crust flavors. The tannins are somewhat unbalanced, suggesting work needs to be done in the vineyard."
Syrah,"Always a standout, this is the only one of the Cayuse Syrahs that is cofermented with Viognier. This explodes with flavors of blueberries, soy, earth, black tea, iodine, anise and salt, plus a hint of sassafras. Notes of herb and cured meat add further interest to this unique, captivating effort."
Syrah,"Tightly wound purple fruits are decorated by peppercorn, roasted lamb and a tarry touch on the nose of this bottling by Bob Lindquist, which also includes small bits of Tempranillo and other varieties. The cool climate character is carried to the sip as well, where charred black-currant, white-pepper, rosemary and grilled-beef flavors abound."
Syrah,"The aromas are quite reticent, with notes of herb, purple fruit and abundant wood spices. Still, the palate delivers plush-feeling fruit flavors, speckled with attractive barrel accents."
Syrah,"Earthy with an expansive mouthfeel, this brambly, savory Syrah reveals hints of herb and deep, dark black fruit. It comes from a great vineyard site and is structured to age; give it air before enjoying with a proper cassoulet."
Syrah,"This exuberant wine has aromas of raspberry jam, thyme, orange peel, earth, iron and olive. It's rich and intensely flavorful, with waves of mouthwatering fruit and savory notes that lead to an extended finish."
Syrah,"Sourced from the Clifton Hill vineyard, this is a supple and fruity Syrah, with exceptional depth of flavor. A mix of tart cherry and plum fruit, it's annotated with notes of graphite, ash, tobacco and dark chocolate."
Syrah,"Dark and sexy; there's something erotic about this wine, with its seductive jammy flavors, velvety texture and spicy, long finish. After an initial bite of acidity, it turns soft as a goose-down pillow. In its own way, it's perfect. And the price is unreal. Best Buy."
Syrah,"Enhanced with a bit of Viognier, this wine shows an intriguing mix of violet-like fruit and fragrant juniper on the nose, alongside some game and pepper. Tar opens the palate, but then it evolves toward elderberry jam, coffee and very dark chocolate, with more black pepper and violety fruit on the finish."
Syrah,"The aromas are brooding, with notes of barrel spice, black licorice and jammy dark fruit. The cranberry and cherry flavors are palate coating and dense—a hedonistic delight."
Syrah,"From the Heintz Vineyard, well-known for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, comes this compelling Syrah. A burst of toasted oak and dry tannins upon entry develops slowly into a taste of ripe, black fruit, black olives and tar. Surrounded by a soft palate the wine is also marked by a starkness of black pepper and hint of lavender."
Syrah,"Aromas of herb, granite, pomegranate and brooding dark fruit leads to a full-flavored palate, bursting with red fruit and savory accents. The tannins provide some heft but should settle in nicely with additional time in the bottle."
Syrah,"There are so many unexpected joys in this 100% varietal wine, given the chance to shine in light-bodied wisps of tangerine, lemon and lime. Despite its delicate nature, it doesn't skimp on satisfaction nor complexity, delivering waves of flavor sip after sip."
Syrah,"The Lewis vineyard is already proven as a first-rate site for Syrah. This new entry in Va Piano's black label series verifies it once again. Elegant and complex, it sends up subtle citrus scents, along with concentrated flavors of bush and berry, licorice, mocha and smoke. The details pile on and the finish lingers gracefully."
Syrah,"Despite a mild green character, this is mostly a solid, saturated wine. The nose has lettuce, pepper and berry scents, and the palate is racy and snappy, with red fruit and herbal accents. It's competent and definitely looks, smells and tastes like Syrah."
Syrah,"The wine is dry, soft, elegant and lovely, with full-bodied black cherry, currant, red licorice and cola flavors. It certainly is one of the best Syrahs you can buy at this price."
Syrah,"In 2005 Charles Smith introduced three high-end Syrahs. In 2006 Smith has made a wine better than each of these, by combining them into a single wine—Royal City Syrah. Rich scents of purple fruit, smoked meat, cedar, lead pencil, moist earth and so on proclaim a wine with genuine gravitas. There is nothing missing, from the first sniff to the last sip, the wine delivers on all levels. Complex, beautifully balanced, powerful and detailed."
Syrah,"A very good Syrah, easily the winery's best in years. It's most notable for the power of its flavors, offering a flood of black-pepper-infused cured meat and ripe black cherry. The richness is wrapped into firm tannins. With its long finish, this should provide pleasant drinking over the next few years."
Syrah,"Ruby red in the glass, this bottling shows bright cranberry and boysenberry on the nose with a hint of rose petals. There is decent tension to the sip, where tart plum skins meet with graphite flavors."
Syrah,"Green pepper and tobacco aromas signal some of the sour fruit that appears on the palate. Tastes of beets and pie cherries and an oaky, disparate finish doesn't do much to shape things up. Too sour and scattered."
Syrah,"A solid example of the variety, with complex red and black fruits mixing it up with additional grace notes of coffee, sweet spice, toast and licorice. It's a balanced effort, with rather delicate tannins, and a finish that quits just a little early."
Syrah,"Here's a dry, somewhat brawny wine that has some charm. It's filled with briary, peppery flavors, with fruits suggesting blackberries and cassis. Good value in an inexpensive steak and chops wine."
Syrah,"Black pepper, crushed herbs and red raspberry fruit aromas give this elegant red a place at the dinner table. Red fruit, cedar and vanilla on the palate are balanced with soft acidity. Pair with smoked fish, cheeses and lamb."
Syrah,"Complex and meaty, this deeply colored Syrah from a family estate vineyard oozes flavors of toasted oak, pepper, grilled cherries (if there is such a thing) and grilled beef. There is more going on than just fruit and oak, as the earthy-spicy tones meld with fine-grain tannins. This kept getting better hours after opening and should mature well through 2018."
Syrah,"Almost all syrah with just a smidgeon of viognier (0.4%) added, it has notes of cherry, mint, and blackberry. Buttery oak spices (22% new French) accent sweet fruit flavors though a long, expressive finish."
Syrah,"A dark core of black plum, blueberry and violet marks the nose of this single-vineyard bottling. The palate showcases purple fruit and floral notes, with concentrated black plum skin and more violet leading the way."
Syrah,"This is a svelte, easy-drinking style of Crozes. Cassis-scented fruit dominates, with perhaps just a hint of vanilla, but doesn't show much complexity. Ample weight and and an open-knit texture makes it already approachable. Drink now–2022."
Syrah,"The Walla Walla Syrah from Trust Cellars is enhanced with 11% Cabernet Sauvignon from the Lewis vineyard, and coopered in 22% new French oak. There is lovely fruit here, with sweet grape, cherry and plum, followed by streaks of chocolate and caramel."
Syrah,"A harsh wine, with cutting acids and a thin flavor of raspberry candy."
Syrah,"Meaty in wild berry and leather, this is a high-toned wine with a gritty texture that evolves to become velvety in the glass. Generously ripe and rich in body, it's intense and fresh in equal measure, showing a complement of balanced brawn and beauty."
Syrah,"Peat, flower, smoked meat and earthy funk aromas are at the fore. The flavors show a combination of richness and elegance, with smoked meat and olive brine flavors that linger."
Syrah,"Blackberry and blueberry juice aromas are lifted by vanilla and anise on the nose of this bottling from a Westside Paso producer. The tannins are strong and thick, and then smooth out into blackberry, mocha and vanilla flavors into the finish."
Syrah,"A dramatically rich Syrah made along Northern Rhône lines. Dry, full-bodied and tannic, its flavors now are primary and fresh, suggesting summer blackberries, a few of them shriveled into raisins, and the whole sprinkled with cassis and black pepper. Needs time. Better after 2013."
Syrah,"White and black pepper jump out of the glass, calling to the senses in this wine from the Wallace Creek Vineyard. A complex tangle of body and texture interweaves between an underlying elegance that belies the considerable ripeness behind this wine."
Syrah,"Huckleberry, blackberry, coffee and bramble aromas lead to full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors in this wine. It's appealing despite the heavy-handed oak."
Syrah,"VM takes a huge leap in the Syrah race with this wine. It's inky purple in color, with hints of pepper, espresso and black olive accenting blueberry and blackberry fruit. A plush coating partially conceals ample structure, while the richly textured finish lingers a good long time. Drink now–2025."
Syrah,"I can see why so many of Washington's winemakers love this young vineyard. It is already expressing the sort of subtleties that most viticulturalists would kill for. The fruit is ripe but not too sweet or jammy. It is annotated with citrus, leaf and stem, along with streaks of smoke and herb and mineral. It's all mixed together seamlessly and focused into a firm, almost muscular style with real authority."
Syrah,"Brosseau scored with this bottling last year, and the '06 is as good, showing the same classy elegance. It's drily tannic, but enormously rich in currants, with complexities of smoky leather, tobacco, olive tapenade and tamari-sauteed wild mushrooms. Delicious now, and should develop bottle complexities through 2012."
Syrah,"A pristine core of blackberry and cherry extend from nose to palate here, but there's an ample dose of spice, coconut and toast as well. Full bodied and supple in texture, it's a robust wine with an accessible fruity style."
Syrah,"Retailer-turned-winemaker Doug Margerum drops aromas of boysenberry-cherry pie with peppercorn crust on this wine, which slightly predates the Ballard Canyon appellation creation. The flavors are down the middle, with ripe elderberries, Italian herbs and hops providing an intriguing, heady mix."
Syrah,"An aromatic, low-alcohol Syrah, this opens with spice, pepper and tart cranberry fruit. It layers in flavors of blue plum and a light wreath of smoke. It's an elegant style, miles away from the usual amped-up blockbuster Northwest Syrahs."
Syrah,"Cofermented with 6% Viognier, this is a perfumed wine with notes of fresh flowers, orange peel, herb and blue fruit. The elegant blue fruit flavors persist, with abundant floral accents."
Syrah,"Green olive, green stem and fresh herb aromas are at the fore, with cured meat, peat, smoke and mineral notes close behind. The palate offers dense fruit and savory flavors that command attention, with smoked meat notes that just won't quit. The balance and length are mesmerizing."
Syrah,"This is a beautifully perfumed wine, with violets and ripe juicy black fruits. It has a concentrated firm structure that puts the fruitiness on a pedestal and gives it shape and intensity. The wine, named by the Danish and American owners after Denmark's literary legend, Hans Christian Andersen, is ready to drink."
Syrah,"Sugary sweet, this blend has jammy flavors of raspberries and cherries, with a sprinkling of chocolate."
Syrah,"Inky, penetrating and bursting with black-fruit aromas as well as coffee, mocha and pastry notes. The palate is perfectly lush and deep, with smooth tannins and proper acidity propelling jammy, lovely berry flavors. Dark, smoky and rubbery on the finish, with a streamlined tail. One of the best Chilean Syrahs. Drink now through 2014; only 150 cases made."
Syrah,"Despite the abv listed, this wine does not seem especially ripe. Peppery highlights carry a whiff of onion, and between the alcohol burn and the green edges, the wine has not come together. Aging in 40% new oak adds some toast, but not grip or density."
Syrah,"There's a noticeable stemmy quality on the nose of this incredibly intriguing, almost mysterious wine, with green and pink peppercorns, crushed coffee beans and squeezed blueberry fruit aromas. A woodiness pervades the palate too, where roasted poblano chile meets with smoked cigar, lavender, dried berries and asphalt. It evolves steadily while open, and will drink with fascination 2016–2028."
Syrah,"This baby starts out like any child; it's awkward and clumsy. But it's also nicely extracted and chewy, with ripe plum fruit, hints of licorice and a culminating toasty, slightly burnt note. The finish is tight and beefy, with good tannins, while overall it's enjoyable to drink even if it doesn't pretend to be highly sophisticated."
Syrah,"Waves of purple floral fragrance meld with soy, blackberry and roast lamb on the nose of this complex and compelling bottling. It's quite soft on the palate, with black plum and hoisin sauce flavors accenting its core of dried purple fruit, black pepper and bacon fat. The finish offers a touch of maple syrup."
Syrah,"Quite why Smart Dog is a good name for a wine is a mystery. The wine itself a rich, soft Syrah with attractive ripe blackberry and plum flavors and soft, finely integrated tannins. It's an enjoyable wine that's ready to drink."
Syrah,"This big but complex wine offers wonderful varietal characteristics. Sage and blackberry highlight the aromas, while equally interesting black pepper, beef and blackberry flavors expand on the palate. It has very good depth and a distinctive flavor profile, too."
Syrah,"This is a supple, spicy wine, with a core of black cherry fruit. It's complemented with lighter flavors of cola, earth and coffee. At first it seems to fade a little too quickly, but with some breathing time the finish expands and brings in notes of cracker and toast."
Syrah,"Dried blueberry, leather, soy and pepper notes show on the nose of this bottling from the region's Syrah pioneer. The palate is very dry and brimming with deep purple flower, black fruit and herb flavors."
Syrah,"This Syrah-based wine,  with 10% Sangiovese, boasts gorgeous harmony and elegance. Tones of charred meat, leather and sweet spice are obvious but the wine also has delicate little touches of forest berry, lavender and rose petal that make it charming as well as powerful."
Syrah,"Funk Estate (60%) and Watermill vineyards—both in The Rocks District—make up this wine. It's initially aromatically brooding with high-toned notes of stems, green herbs, coffee, funk and mineral, with generous floral notes providing accents. The palate is rounded and full, with fruit and savory flavors intertwining, showing a very pretty precision. The finish is lengthy."
Syrah,"Boasting one of the prettiest hot pink-meets-purple colors imaginable in wine, this offers aromas of freeze-dried strawberries, ripe raspberry and a bitter tinge of pink grapefruit and cranberry. The flavors reflect those aromas exactly, particularly the raspberry fruit."
Syrah,"This captures the gamy, herbal, earthy complexity of Washington Syrah, but mutes it somewhat behind a wall of raspberry fruit. Not a bad combo by any means! This one carries some stemmy flavors into the finish. Just enough to put a hard edge on it."
Syrah,"The Wallula vineyard, set high atop a bluff overlooking the Columbia river, gives grapes that bring dark, roasted flavors to the large-scale wine. The fruit tastes as if it has been pushed, perhaps a bit too far, and the impression it leaves tilts toward the raisiny side. It's a wine that could go in a positive direction with cellar time, but it is impossible to tell right now, as it cuts off quickly once in the mouth."
Syrah,"You want lush, plush and opulent in your California Syrah? Here you go. It's soft and intricate, with lacy tannins framing complex flavors of blackberries, black cherries, bacon, black pepper, anise and sandalwood. Just delicious now and for the next two to three years."
Syrah,"Some producer in Carneros didn't want the wine that went into this negociant's ‘07 Syrah, to judge by its quality. Lucky for Cameron Hughes. It's a fine wine, full-bodied and dry, with spicy flavors of currants, teriaki beef, black pepper and cola, with a bracing minerality that grounds the richness. Could be more concentrated, but it's a very great value."
Syrah,"Since 2009, the producer has sourced from this site, a relatively warm pocket of the northern reaches of the appellation. Vibrant in red cherry fruit, it's also layered and velvety smooth, with astructure and density that makes it complex and compelling. The fruit dances in blackberry as well as strawberry, with a subtle herbal undertone."
Syrah,"A sound, rich Syrah whose deep flavors are wrapped into a fine, sturdy structure. Nothing flabby about the blackberries, currants, chocolate and pepper, which are accompanied by firm tannins and a crisp bite of acidity. Now–2012, for fresh fruitiness."
Syrah,"The Barrel Select is given 26 months in 100% new oak, and it shows in both the nose and the mouth. Smoke and char are not accents here; they are the main event. The fruit flavors are simple cherry/berry, and thin out rather quickly in the finish."
Syrah,"A blend of fruit from Loess and Echo Ridge vineyards, the aromas of herbs, smoke and berry provide intrigue, with smoked meat notes lurking in the background. The blueberry flavors are full and palate staining, bringing a real sense of presence and balance."
Syrah,"Aromas of raspberry, coffee, herbs, smoke and baking spices are austere on the nose. The fruit and barrel flavors are bright and tart, showing a lot of polish, detail and length."
Syrah,"This tastes barely ripe, with a vegetal flavor compromsing the chocolate and cherry notes. It's soft, making it fall a little flat in the mouth."
Syrah,"Deliciously tasty in blackberry jam, cherry purée, milk chocolate, licorice and peppery spice flavors, with soft, intricate tannins. Feels a bit sharp on the finish, but otherwise a pretty nice Syrah."
Syrah,"A refreshing rosé that's well worth the price. Wild strawberry, bubble gum and cherry are supported by tangerine-tinged acidity. Balanced and refreshing, an excellent summer quaffer."
Syrah,"This very rich, unctuous Syrah is immature and not especially subtle at this time. It's acidic and gooey in jammy blackberries and cherries and milk chocolate, with obvious oak influences. The idea seems to be ageworthiness, but that's a gamble. Could surprise."
Syrah,"Dried berry, leather, cola, and herb notes show on the nose of this bottling from the mountains between the Conejo Valley and Malibu Coast. The flavors are savory at first—all crushed anise and mint—but grow fruitier as it opens, suggesting dark strawberry, blueberry, vanilla and clove. Quite quaffable."
Syrah,"Representing a new level of quality for Waiheke Syrah, this wine boasts captivating aromas of peppered meat, violets and cassis. It's full bodied without being heavy, and the flavors seamlessly blend fruity with savory for a thrilling ride. Finishes long, with firm tannins and a hint of espresso. Drink now¬–2018."
Syrah,"From the Fairbarn Vineyard, this bottling shows fresh-pressed blackberry, violet and lilac aromas, with the slightest wafts of smoke and tar. Although the tannins are quite firm on the sip, this wine is still young and should age well, allowing the bright acidity to continue showing flavors of beef and tart berries in years to come."
Syrah,"Cedarville remains an estate producer to follow in the Foothills, melding a well-farmed site with clean, clear winemaking in the cellar. Grown on decomposed granite hillsides, this Syrah has 4% Viognier, just the right touch to bring out the best aromatics, highlighted by sage. Dark, earthy and leathery, this wine is holding onto its tannin and oak, but given time to rest in the cellar 5–7 years, it'll scream to be served with cassoulet."
Syrah,"This is Jaffurs' reserve-style Syrah, the best barrels from various vineyards. It's softly tannic and incredibly complex, with waves of blackberry jam, cassis, chocolate, gingersnap cookie and pepper flavors that are rich and intense. Beautiful and compelling, the wine finishes dry."
Syrah,"This project aimed to show how well Washington wines can age and the proof is in the bottle. Aromas are complex, with notes of dried cranberry, cherry, leather, black tea, cocoa and mushroom. The palate is packed with rich fruit flavors that show no signs of slowing down. It flat-out impresses."
Syrah,"Give this lush, rich Syrah two or three years to soften and develop in the bottle. It's a very good wine, offering impressive blackberry, blueberry and cherry-pie filling flavors, wrapped into fine acids and tannins. But it's fresh and young and will get better. Better well into 2011."
Syrah,"Raspberry preserves with whiffs of violet and white pepper mark the nose. A medium-bodied palate of red currant and blueberry meet twiggy flavors, carried by sharp acidity and grainy tannins."
Syrah,"Full bodied, this estate-made, 100% varietal wine is sinewy and dense, a combination of ripe, luscious blackberry and blueberry, akin to a compote, seasoned in lavender and black licorice. Weighty, it'll pair well with wintertime meals, finishing with a suggestion of vanilla bean."
Syrah,"Aromas of smoke, sawdust and herbs are followed by lighter-styled cherry and cranberry flavors with spice accents."
Syrah,"A dark, brooding and concentrated wine, this boasts rich black-fruit aromas and flavors of blackberry, boysenberry and cherry that are flecked with accents of tar, licorice, leather and peppery curing spice. Additional notes of tea leaves, sweet spice, licorice root and chicory grace the finish. The texture is like crushed velvet, with spicy tannins that linger long. Delicious now, but this should age well through 2022."
Syrah,"There's value for the money in this smooth wine. It smacks of cherries, not the darker, deeper fruits of Syrah, but it does have a complex leathery, meaty edge. The tannin-acid balance is just right, and leads to a simple, fruity finish."
Syrah,"Volatile and sharp, this well-aged (though current) release tastes of vanilla, maple syrup and cut tobacco. After lengthy aging (48 months) in 60% new oak, the wood flavors have taken over."
Syrah,"Winemaker Spencer Daley taps a long respected vineyard to craft a solid Syrah that shows lavender, boysenberry, white pepper and dried fennel on the nose. There is a tarry quality to the palate, with black peppercorn, violet and charred beef notes accenting the underlying elderberry fruit. A solid structure ensures ageability."
Syrah,"Dusty and tight, with a whiff of coffee and cocoa introducing an elegant wine with interesting streaks of metal and graphite. Young fruit and fine tannins are in perfect balance, and the wine has a lovely delicacy."
Syrah,"A taste of black plum, tar and tobacco is most prominent in this wine. It's dense on the palate, medium in length and yet proffers a lift of acidity toward the finish, a sprinkling of varietal white pepper lingering provocatively. From near Spring Mountain, the grapes reflect a relative coolness, wrapped in concentration."
Syrah,"Berry aromas are a touch dusty and floral on the nose, with hints of earth and cedar. On the palate, this wine is bright and balanced, with fresh acidity. Rich berry, cassis and spice flavors finish agile and long. Drink through 2016."
Syrah,"This is Syrah at its rich and rugged finest, with aromas of grilled game, freshly turned earth, barnyard and even body odor. Once sipped, flavors of a blackberry-crusted roast and clove emerge, with serious tannins that will promise ageability. It's good for drinking now, but can hold until 2017."
Syrah,"The aromas don't seem entirely settled, with notes of char, tire rubber, bacon fat and vanilla accents. The fruit flavors are smoky and sweet, with a slightly astringent feel."
Syrah,"This is a shockingly good wine. The aromas draw you into the glass, with vibrant notes of capers and Kalamata olives, brine, smoke meat, mineral, black pepper and earth. The fruit and savory flavors—speckled by black and green olive notes throughout—show a compelling sense of texture and richness. It's a savory delight."
Syrah,"This is the only Cayuse Syrah that is co-fermented (with 8% Viognier), which adds nuances of white flower and floral, though the citrus rind scents override them. In the nose it's hugely expressive, though still quite tight and compact in the mouth; it must be decanted. It's a three ring circus of a wine, with things moving and shaking in all directions. Mineral, berry, mountain complexity, nuanced herb and earth and citrus, all in proportion, and all flowing in the mouth."
Syrah,"An aromatic wine with sharp edges, it sports bright flavors of lemon pepper, sour cherry and spicy herb. It's definitely tending toward the greener side of Syrah, but offers some interesting complexity."
Syrah,"Plenty of spicy, toasty wood is balanced by the rich black, dense fruits. The wine is coming together well. Blackberries come through strongly, partnered by the firm tannins and lifted by acidity. It needs to age, so drink from 2016."
Syrah,"Released quite young, this is a wine to decant. It's big and dark and tannic, tight as a tick, with grainy, textural tannins wrapped heavily around tart blue and purple berries. Though the flavors are pure Syrah, the structure and density are Cabernet-like, and though it's a guess, the odds are this is a wine to cellar for at least a decade."
Syrah,"Cottanera interprets Etna through the lens of international grape varieties like Syrah. Sole di Sesta shows chewy berry and smoked bacon overtones that are characteristic of the grape, with enhanced mineral finesse that is typical of volcanic soil."
Syrah,"This Syrah offers bright tones of leather, cured meat and blackberry. Smooth and long-lasting, the palate boasts loads of bright berries."
Syrah,"The aromas jump up, with mesmerizing notes of fresh herbs, green olive, violets, orange peel, smoked meat and huckleberry. The palate shows a light but pillowy texture alongside flavors that carry on the finish. It's all about subtlety."
Syrah,"Immensely toasty aromas overcome the light fruit from the get-go. Thin flavors of raspberry and black-cherry candy carry it a while, but the oaky finish seems way out of proportion to the fruit."
Syrah,"A whirlwind of aromas—peppered black cherries, elderberry, caramel, toast, barrel smoke—rise off this appellation blend from German-born winemaker Matthias Pippig, who handcrafts small batches on Santa Barbara's Eastside. It's very soft on the palate, with medium-dark flavors of butter-crusted plum pie and an herbal note of pine pitch keeping it serious."
Syrah,"Very dry and tannicly tart, with blackberry, currant and pepper flavors touched with oak. This is a good, everyday wine to drink with rich meat dishes and cheeses."
Syrah,"This magnum-size wine, named after the Tensleys' son, Oliver Gunnar, is still very young, especially for the large size, but the aromas of purple flower, tar, salt, pepper and black plum are very promising. Zesty pepper and thyme show on the sip along with black-plum paste and savory hoisin touches, held together by a very grippy texture. This heavy-duty wine needs time to blossom. Drink 2019–2030."
Syrah,"Sourced from the lieu dits of Le Méal and Les Greffieux, this is a sturdy, tannic rendering of Hermitage. It's smoky, meaty and cedary upfront, with blackberry fruit and plenty of savory notes that linger through the drying finish. Drink 2020–2030."
Syrah,"There's a superb structure to this Syrah-Viognier blend. It's rich in tannins and acids that provide a framework to the dry, rich black cherry, currant, licorice and sandalwood flavors. Gains depth as it breathes in the glass. Drink now–2015."
Syrah,"Pure purple aromas of boysenberry jam and Concord grapes swirl amidst melted dark chocolate, maple-drizzled bacon and touches of beef carpaccio on the nose of this bottling from a coveted vineyard. Starting with strong blueberry and blackberry fruit, the palate then sizzles with acidity through the fine-grained tannic structure. The midpalate shows meaty depth with roasting herbs and minty lift throughout."
Syrah,"Spicy and bright, with an almost-too-ripe note to the fruit. Sweet ripe berries are joined by hints of sweet tomato and fecund, autumnal flavors, suggesting that this Syrah should be consumed sooner rather than later."
Syrah,"There's a harsh edge of acidic, green sharpness to this wine. It's bone dry, with very modest blackberry fruit."
Syrah,"This big mouthful of wine offers great value. Smelling like licorice and chocolate and tasting like superripe berries and black figs, this brute has full body, great concentration and richness of flavor, a thick but soothing texture, and a long, lingering finish."
Syrah,"Aromas of freshly cut wood, pencil eraser and spice crowd out berry scents. Choppy grating tannins make for a firm mouthfeel, while flavors of savory spices and briary black fruits finish oaky, with residual scratchy tannins. Give this plenty of air for it to show its best."
Syrah,"A new offering from this winery, this pulls no punches with its dense, concentrated flavors of raspberry jam, red apple, peppery spices and huckleberry. It offers a dazzling mouthfeel and an extended finish."
Syrah,"High alcohol stars in this Syrah. Prickly heat dominates, giving a fiery warmth to the blackberry, cassis and grilled beef flavors."
Syrah,"Initial aromas of horsey red-berry fruits are jammy as well as grassy. This feels blocky and static on the palate, while plum and berry flavors are more generic than specific. A finish with licorice, pepper and spice flavors is bold, with firm tannic grip."
Syrah,"It's hard to resist the charms of this delicious Syrah. It has brisk acids and tannins, yet it's curiously soft on the palate, with rich, exotically sweet flavors of black currants, dark chocolate, bacon and plum sauce."
Syrah,"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, the aromas of violets, dried herbs, brown stems and smoked meat pop. The fruit and savory flavors show an exquisite sense of balance that persists through the extended finish."
Syrah,"This ready to drink wine seems tailor-made for many—loaded with blueberry fruit, it's a soft, smooth, easy-drinking style. The rich streaks of vanilla and milk chocolate keep it satisfying to the very end."
Syrah,"Drinks hot and fruity, with the flavors of spiced blackberry punch. It's not the most delicate wine to ever come down the pike, but it is dry, rich and tasty, with that big, bright, jolting fruitiness that only warm sun can make."
Syrah,"From the first whiff of cherry, cranberry and caramel you know you are in for a treat. Flavors of clove, marzipan and grilled peach add nuance to the red fruit driven palate. The smooth tannins persist without overpowering the bright fruit and spice tones."
Syrah,"A nice, flavorful and dry Syrah for drinking now with barbecue or a rich lamb or beef stew. Soft and gentle, it's rich in blackberries, cherries, currants, beef jerky, pepper and smoky oak."
Syrah,"A new addition to the lineup, this wine is a blend of fruit from Stoney Vine, Lawrence, Red Heaven and Art Den Hoed vineyards. It offers aromas of earthy funk, smoked meat, blueberry, cherry and high-toned spices. The palate is dense and layered, with a mixture of fruit and savory flavors that display poise, focus and length."
Syrah,"This superb Syrah, is a great followup to the 2009 bottling. There are incredibly ripe flavors of blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and toast, along with notes of grilled bacon and black pepper. The tannins are so rich and fine, you can drink this wine now."
Syrah,"The winery's most-available Syrah is co-fermented with a splash of Viognier. The fruit is tight and compact, clean with red and black berry flavors, framed by firm, polished tannins."
Syrah,"Boysenberry, dark cranberry and damp garden herbs show on the nose of this wine made in Santa Barbara's urban Eastside neighborhood. Dark red, bordering on purple fruits are lifted by a nice peppery spice along with a bit of sweet tar, combining for a thorough sipping experience."
Syrah,"A friendly wine with aromatic hints of cassis, coconut and chocolate. This wine reflects its northern locale with popping raspberry and plum flavors. On the other hand, there is also plenty of wood thrown at it, so expect loads of brown sugar, spice and peppery resin. One of Tamaya's best wines to date. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC."
Syrah,"Sweet aromas of leather and caramel seem murky and tired. The palate comes without snap, and that's despite some plum and raspberry flavors. The finish is lean and basic, and overall it's a simple wine that doesn't really taste much like Syrah."
Syrah,"This remarkably bone-dry wine from a cool-climate vineyard shows black plum, smoked beef, cracked peppercorn and slate scents on the nose. The palate recalls cedar and sandalwood, along with charcoal, pepper and soy-like flavors, framed by chalky and firm tannins."
Syrah,"This wine shows roasted beef with blackberry crust, fresh-cracked black pepper and tarry asphalt on the nose. The asphalt and charred meat play strongly on the heavy-duty palate that also offers blackberry balsamic reduction. It's brawny and burly, perhaps too much so for the everyday drinker."
Syrah,"Jammy, earthy, chocolaty blackberry aromas come with a minerally note of vitamins and grit. This is bold and lively on the palate, with black plum, brandied cherry, herb and charred-oak flavors. Burnt toast and blackened berry flavors finish woody, chocolaty and lemony."
Syrah,"Extremely lifting and fluffy aromas of grape soda, very ripe olallieberries and nearly a bubblegum element arise on the nose of this accessible wine, which will appeal to lovers of many varietals. It's similarly poppy and easy to sip on the palate, with a strong acidic zing."
Syrah,"Though light in color and body, this wine carries tremendous aromas and flavors, thanks in part to its 5% cofermented Viognier. The nose shows charred beef, crushed elderberry and potpourri scents, while the palate shows tart red currant and cranberry fruit, with smoked beef, white, pepper, rosemary and fennel accents."
Syrah,"Perfumed and aromatically distinctive wine, it carries notes of juniper, sagebrush, black pepper and cranberry. It's soft and sultry, lighter in feel, narrowing toward the finish."
Syrah,"Fresh squeezed boysenberry and raspberry make for a lively fruit entry to the nose of this bottling by one of the area's more respected vineyard managers, who also packs some thyme, sagebrush and pine into the nose as well. Similar flavors pop on the fruity yet herbal palate, where snappy berry flavors meet with tarragon and mint."
Syrah,"This full-bodied, creamy Crozes-Hermitage far outpaces expectations for the appellation, combining cherry-berry fruit with cracked pepper, mocha and licorice. Then it finishes long, anchored by a marriage of fruit and spice. It's ready to drink now, but should evolve positively through at least 2017."
Syrah,"This Syrah opens with aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, ground black pepper and a whiff of cedar that all carry over to the dense, one-dimensional palate, along with a licorice note. It's balanced by firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017."
Syrah,"The yum factor on this wine is impossible to ignore, with aromas of jammy blue fruit, dried herbs and cigar box. The concentrated, high-octane flavors are full and textured with a lingering finish."
Syrah,"Give this lush young wine a year or two to come around. That should give all the elements time to meld. It's a juicy, ripe wine, bursting with jammy cherry and cassis flavors, with a strong note of white pepper and clove that dissolves into a tannic finish."
Syrah,"An impressive Syrah, not just for its ripeness, but for the structure. Fine, firm tannins and acids, along with well-integrated oak, provide a classic framework to the ripe blackberries, leather and chocolate. Good now, with decanting, but really wants 2–4 years of aging."
Syrah,"Wickedly, sinfully good. This is fruit detonation in the mouth, a blast of pure, sweet cassis, currant, plum and chocolate. The tannins are a velvety wonder, the oak lavish and thick, but perfectly in balance to the size. Opulent and hedonistic, it's best in its sensual, seductive youth."
Syrah,"Young and very much still developing, Sentinel Oak is Terre Rouge's single-vineyard Syrah, a spicy, smoky concoction of great depth, intensity and beauty, concentrated and eager to mature. This wine has a pronounced meaty quality to it, and will pair accordingly, particularly with smoked meat, which will accentuate its own smoky allure."
Syrah,"Enormously rich, with intense blackberry and cherry jam, currant, dark chocolate and bacon flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. The vineyard is in a warm, high elevation part of the county. Delicious now, and should acquire additional bottle interest over the next six years."
Syrah,"An outstanding and uniquely styled Syrah. The mix of tart fruits, peppers, herbs, earth and forest floor flavors is riveting. The wine dances and bows, it takes you on a leaping trip through a world of Syrah rarely found anywhere else, buoyed by the brilliant natural acidity of Washington fruit."
Syrah,"This feral and gamy wine shows roast lamb, rosemary, dried fennel, rose petal and forest floor aromas on its dynamic nose. The palate leads with explosive acidity, before waves of Concord grape and blackberry flavor take hold. It's light on its feet but has some textural firmness, finishing on rosemary, lavender and game notes."
Syrah,"Fruity, spicy and dry, with full-bodied flavors of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, mocha and crushed black pepper. Feels a bit hot and glyceriney-sweet from high alcohol."
Syrah,"Powerful and spicy, this is a concentrated wine. It has a firm and rich structure of solid tannins. That contrasts with the black plum and juicy berry fruits. Together, they make a wine that is impressive, dark and only just ready to drink. Best wait until 2017."
Syrah,"A simple but satisfying Syrah, sweet and jammy in raspberry, cherry and blackberry fruit flavors, with lots of black pepper. Earns extra points for good tannins and balancing acidity."
Syrah,"Syrah and Dry Creek Valley have long been good partners, and this dry, rich wine shows why. It's firm in tannins, but they're finely ground, giving the wine a nice grit to play against fine grilled beef or lamb. The flavors are textbook, suggesting black currants, black raspberries, violets, anisette and dark chocolate."
Syrah,"There's a reason why Syrah is on a roll in America, and it's wines like this that make the case. Soft and juicy, it's a mellow, sensual wine, with a taffeta mouthfeel that carries rich flavors of cherry-pie filling, red licorice and vanilla oak that are delicious and worthy of a second glass."
Syrah,"Here is a dark, smoky, meaty Syrah, smooth in the mouth and showing plenty of black cherry fruit. The silkiness plays nicely against flavors that are dark with olive, espresso and cacao, and highlighted with hints of orange peel and pepper."
Syrah,"Aged 17 months in 50% new French oak, this wine offers coffee, blue and black fruit and bittersweet chocolate. It's lush and hedonistic in style, drinking like a candy bar, showing good concentration to the fruit flavors with a lingering finish."
Syrah,"A single-vineyard Syrah from an up-and-coming vineyard, this wine is chock full of notes of coarsely ground black pepper along with celery salt, smoked meat, cherry and iron. The acid is tart and fresh with the tannins a touch dry on the finish."
Syrah,"Fresh blueberry and blackberry juice aromas meet with pepper and pressed lavender on the nose of this sleek bottling by Michael Larner, one of the Ballard Canyon appellation's loudest proponents. Black plum and dried black raspberry flavors show on the palate, which is layered with cracked pepper, cigar box and a minty lift on the lengthy sip."
Syrah,"This wine comes from all free-run juice and was aged 16 months in three- to four-year-old French barrels. The result is a luxuriously pure wine that puts a premium on the feel of its plum and cranberry flavors, with a light squeeze of tannins that brings it home."
Syrah,"Not at all shy, this bold, brash wine will be great to drink with equally bold food. A very dark color and a tempting aroma like grilled baguette slices leads to big, powerful berry flavors, full body, high alcohol, thick but soft tannins and a smoky, meaty finish."
Syrah,"Long a strong suit at Snoqualmie, this new vintage does not disappoint. It's light and lively, with dusky flavors of plum and sweet tomato. Highlights of chocolate and cinnamon are delicately in focus, and it's hard to find a better price for such a nice Syrah in Washington."
Syrah,"Michael Larner is making savory Syrahs to sit on. This one from 2010 offers perfectly ready black and white pepper scents along with blueberry, black licorice candy and violet flowers. It's viscous on the palate, with mace and all sorts of peppery flavors, picking up a bit of scorched lemon tartness and remaining a bit tannic. This may get even better in years to come."
Syrah,"This is not only one of the best Syrahs of the vintage, it's easily the greatest Syrah ever produced from Sonoma Valley. Stuns with its soft,  complex, black and blue berry, teriaki beef, black pepper and sandalwood flavors. The depth is unbelievable, the length impressive. Clearly a first growth Syrah, and should develop bottle complexity for the next six years, if not longer."
Syrah,"A great Syrah, from a winery better known for Pinot. The wine shows true power in the blueberry, blackberry, mulberry, spice and smoke flavors. Yet it's so elegantly constructed, with fine Central Coast acidity and imposingly rich, fine tannins. An important wine that should have an interesting future over the next 6–8 years."
Syrah,"Adam Comartin's San Jose-based label shines a bright light on this new appellation. This wine shows blackberry shave ice, black cherries, black pepper, cola and the lifting aromatics of violets on the nose. More black pepper spices up the palate, with the balanced cherry and berry power proving quite distinctive and regal."
Syrah,"Pure Syrah, this is the most limited of the Kamiakin wines (in terms of production), but in many respects the star of the show. Peppery, racy and concentrated, it's packed with blueberry, kirsch and cassis. The finish is laced with coffee liqueur flavors, suggesting a far more expensive, barrel-aged wine."
Syrah,"With a light, silky mouthfeel and easy flavors of red currants, spicy plum sauce and cola, this Syrah provides nice drinking now. It's a good, elegant wine, and the winery hasn't raised the price in many years."
Syrah,"Minerally notes accent bright berry aromas. Next up is a racy, high-acid palate that's so juicy it's almost citric. Lead flavors of boysenberry and raspberry are snappy, while pepper and a dash of cocoa come later. The finish is more cleansing and fresh than complex."
Syrah,"This Syrah contains some Cabernet Sauvignon, which gives it a solid edge of hard tannins. It's finely constructed and complex, with ripe, elaborate blackberry, black currant, grilled meat, pepper and sandalwood flavors. Tight and young, it will begin to resolve its internal difficulties by 2015."
Syrah,"M.C.K. stands for Motor City Kitty, and along with the winery's Milbrandt Syrah, this is the entry-level offering in a vast portfolio of single vineyard bottlings. Tasty, toasty, supple and fruity, this carries slight hints of citrus, earth and stem and wraps its appealing, forward flavors in a light coating of milk chocolate."
Syrah,"This wine earns its high score by virtue of sheer richness. It's enormous in blackberry, cassis, roasted meat, licorice, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors, and finishes dry and spicy. There's a tannic toughness that resists the palate, and doesn't seem likely to age out, so drink over the next few years."
Syrah,"This wine has a rustic but appealing air about it, with its cedary pepper and luscious jam nose and elegant balance of berry, smoke and spice. The wine is approachable and will pair with smoked meats and spicy dishes well."
Syrah,"Your immediate impression of this Syrah is power. It's a darkly colored, big, thick and intensely flavored wine, with furry tannins framing massive flavors of blackberries, teryaki beef, black pepper and smoky oak. Easily deserves its high score despite a certain rude assault."
Syrah,"Tough cherry and plum aromas lead it off, followed by simple, semitart raspberry flavors. There's not much depth or complexity; the palate bounces along inoffensively, and the finish is quick and light. Clean and basic wine."
Syrah,"This is a lovely Syrah. It has a medium-bodied lightness that feels velvety in the mouth, and is packed with sweet blackberry, plum, mocha and bacon flavors, accented with smoky sandalwood. Nice to drink now, and will gain traction over the next 6–8 years."
Syrah,"This wine has perfumed aromas of sagebrush, potpourri, herb, purple fruit and a light earthy note, showing a lot of nuance and detail. The palate has full palate-coating dark-plum flavors, with the emphasis on purity. Vibrant floral notes persist on the finish. This is the winery's best example from this vineyard to date."
Syrah,"Though quite different stylistically from the 2009, this is just as good. The structure in 2010 is noteworthy for its high acid focus. There are streaks of berry and cassis, with touches of smoke and espresso. This is a wine to cellar while you are drinking up the delicious 2009."
Syrah,"Pulverized peppercorns and dried oregano aromas give ample seasoning to lush blackberry fruit on this wine from a vineyard planted by the Pisoni and Franscioni families. The firm structure implies that this wine will improve with time, but it's already deliciously savory with lots of thyme, anise, menthol, charred beef and pepper throughout the purple fruit flavors."
Syrah,"The aromas of dark fruit, mineral, smoked meat, coffee and spice are brooding, not yet fully revealing their charms. Elegant yet penetrating, the fruit and savory flavors coat the palate from end to end with supple-feeling fruit flavors and a lengthy finish."
Syrah,"The dark and penetrating aromas of violets, shoe polish, blackberry and road tar are solid. This feels a bit tough on the palate, with narrow tannins and flavors of rubber and black plum."
Syrah,"This Syrah is exceptionally rich with flavors of cherries, blackberries, mocha and smoked meat, all touched with a hint of oak. It's tannins and acids provide excellent structure. A deliciously complex wine to drink now and over the next few years."
Syrah,"The winery's first release off its estate vineyard in The Rocks offers expressive, captivating aromas of peat, dried flowers, fire pit, herbs, grilled asparagus, funk and green olive. The flavors are sweet, sumptuous and rich, showing depth and detail. It's a knockout."
Syrah,"Earthy and thin, this has little in the way of fruit flavor or varietal character. Stemmy tannins and sour acids leave an impression of a dilute, unripe wine."
Syrah,"Bright black cherry animates the aromas and flavors of this medium-bodied wine. It is firm in texture, not too complicated or overripe, but just nice and easy to drink."
Syrah,"No questioning the ripeness of this Syrah. It floods the mouth with jammy cherries, blueberries, currants and chocolate, with a peppery edge accented by smoky new oak. A bit soft and obvious in its palate appeal, it's at its best now and for a couple years."
Syrah,"This is the biggest, most tannic and closed of the winery's three new 2007 Syrahs, and also the one most likely to improve in the cellar. It's intense and concentrated in pure blackberry and black cherry fruit, with the pepper, bacon, earth and smoky oak notes you want in a good 100% Syrah. But then, there are those big tannins. Give it a good 4–6 years."
Syrah,"This is big and powerful, soft and rounded, with the tannins buried in the foward black-fruit flavor. It's almost too dense for its own good, a blockbuster that has ripe fruit, but misses out on structure."
Syrah,Olive and espresso notes are backed by bright cherry fruit in this medium-bodied Syrah. It's a pleasant quaff that turns slightly dry on the finish; try it after 2011.
Syrah,"The aromas of plum, blackberry, vanilla, dried herbs and spice provide intrigue. The blue- and black-fruit flavors are linear in style but deliver enjoyment."
Syrah,"This Syrah opens with black-skinned fruit, tilled soil and cooking spice aromas. It's soft and dense on the palate, offering ripe black currant, vanilla and black pepper flavors hemmed in with velvety tannins. Drink through 2021."
Syrah,"This is soft, smooth and refined, with rich, complex blackberry, cassis, bacon, pepper and smoky cedar flavors. Good as it is, it will develop bottle complexities over the next eight years. Almost as good as Zaca Mesa's more expensive Syrahs."
Syrah,"This is a funky briny wine that still seems a bit closed up on first pour. The palate is silky and focused, not having fully come together as of yet but still offering generous fruit, smoked meat and other savory flavors. It's all about elegance."
Syrah,"The aromas offer notes of dark coffee, baking spice, vanilla, and barrel spices. The palate pulls no punches with full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors along with lightly grainy tannins. The wood plays prominently but it works."
Syrah,"A young, 100% varietal and estate-farmed wine, this is a soft, thick and dusty gathering of chocolate and blackberry jam, filled in with wild game and leather. Robust and still tightly wound, it needs to open in the glass to unveil further complexities of texture and black pepper."
Syrah,"Full-bodied, velvety and rich, this is a big Hermitage for a big occasion. Espresso and dark chocolate notes lead the way, buoyed by baking spices, vanilla and plum. It's approachable now, but certain to go another decade in a cool cellar."
Syrah,"Coming in the appellation's specially designed estate bottle, this offering from Michael Larner shows densely packed blackberry and blueberry on the lavish, even creamy nose, alongside rich violets, caramel, lavender and purple sage. There's lots of depth to the palate, where blackberry paste meets with peppery spice, dried lavender and a searing acidity."
Syrah,"A super bargain, this is a concentrated, structured glass of gamy Syrah. Black cherry liqueur, black olives, espresso and meaty flavors combine on the full-bodied palate, finishing with a hefty dose of smoky goodness. Drink now–2025."
Syrah,"This wine doesn't appear to have fully come out of its shell, with light aromas of plum, tire rubber, pomegranate, herb and a dusting of spices. The flavors display a pleasing sense of purity, with lightly grainy tannins providing support."
Syrah,This wine bears a strong resemblance to its sibling from one block over in with its berry and flower aromas. The palate however brings more lushness and texture that persists through the finish.
Syrah,"A fine effort, with an inviting swirl of earthy components. Citrus, spice, earth, compost, coffee grounds and cinnamon comprise this detailed, aromatic wine. It sits squarely in the classic mold of the better Walla Walla Syrahs."
Syrah,"Some unripe, vegetal notes lower the score on this otherwise pleasant Syrah. They interfere with your full enjoyment of black cherries and cassis, and also make aging impossible. Drink up."
Syrah,"With firm tannins and generous blackberry jam, crispy bacon and black pepper flavors, this wine is California ripe all the way. It's pretty upfront, but has some complex mineral and floral notes. Drink through 2019."
Syrah,"Cherry candy, vanilla liqueur and spearmint rise to the nose of this well priced wine by Steve McClean. Dark chocolate-covered cherries and a prominent black pepper character show on the palate."
Syrah,"A real success, this intensely spicy Syrah loads in mouth-softening flavors of buttermilk, cocoa and cinnamon. Lots of toast and coffee, with a creamy, textural mouthfeel. The rich, ripe, almost sweet cherry fruit is like a mouthful of fresh pie."
Syrah,"Solid blackberry, black currant, bacon, black pepper and sandalwood flavors in this dry wine. The grapes come from a small appellation in Mendocino County. It's too soft, lacking structure, but has a certain opulence."
Syrah,"Baked red cherry, crushed clove, iron and rose petals make for standard aromas on this bottling, although they are fairly light and simple here. There is a sizzle of acitity on the palate, where juicy strawberry and olallieberry flavors are easy to enjoy, made more complex by graphite and cedar touches."
Syrah,"Think Crozes-Hermitage and you'll have a reasonable idea of what this wine is about: White pepper and cherry aromas and flavors, medium body without being overly rich or textured and a crisp, peppery finish. Drink it over the next couple of years with burgers and the like."
Syrah,"Once again, the amazing Stillwater Creek vineyard comes through with a highly expressive, pure and intense Syrah that captures the heart and soul of a Washington State take on the grape. The sharp flavors of berries and spice mingle proportionately; the tannins are chiseled and the acids just right."
Syrah,"No two ways about it: this Syrah smells, tastes and finishes with stewy tomato notes and earthy, fruity flavors. The palate feels full but sort of flat, while the flavor profile consists of earthy, stewy berry flavors that veer toward wan and overripe. Prune and earth notes define the finish."
Syrah,"Beautiful black-cherry fruit meets with touches of caramel and liquefied violet on the well-integrated nose of this bottling from the oldest Syrah planting in Santa Barbara County. The flavors are still a bit wound up, even four years on, but the black-currant, lavender, rosemary and charred-beef elements should rise above the wine's firm sticky tannins soon. Drink 2018–2023."
Syrah,"Direct and easy drinking, this is full of ripe blueberry aromas and flavors, framed by hints of toast and a dusting of cinnamon. Drink now."
Syrah,"An aromatic tour de force, this perfumed wine offers hypnotic notes of flowers, green olive, asparagus, sea breeze, mineral, peat, smoke flowers and an earthy funk, showing layers of complexity. The palate's lithe frame belies the richness of the smoke, fire pit and grilled meat flavors that linger."
Syrah,"This intriguing wine brings aromas of cumin, mineral, dry chocolate, barrel spice and dark fruit. It delivers a mouthful of seamless fruit flavors that coat the palate from end to end."
Syrah,"Blended with 12% Grenache and 8% Roussanne, this direct and appealing wine suggests violets, raspberries and plum, with a vanilla top note (21% new American oak). The coffee and blue fruit flavors are rich and full, with vanilla notes lingering on the finish. It's a complete knockout for this price."
